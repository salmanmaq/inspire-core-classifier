1379,2,"Lattice-layer entanglement in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene The complete lattice-layer entanglement structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene is obtained for the quantum system described by a tight-binding Hamiltonian which includes mass and bias voltage terms. Through a suitable correspondence with the parity-spin SU(2)⊗SU(2) structure of a Dirac Hamiltonian, when it brings up tensor and pseudovector external field interactions, the lattice-layer degrees of freedom can be mapped into such a parity-spin two-qubit basis which supports the interpretation of the bilayer graphene eigenstates as entangled ones in a lattice-layer basis. The Dirac Hamiltonian mapping structure simply provides the tools for the manipulation of the corresponding eigenstates and eigenenergies of the Bernal-stacked graphene quantum system. The quantum correlational content is then quantified by means of quantum concurrence, in order to have the influence of mass and bias voltage terms quantified, and in order to identify the role of the trigonal warping of energy in the intrinsic entanglement. Our results show that while the mass term actively suppresses the intrinsic quantum entanglement of bilayer eigenstates, the bias voltage term spreads the entanglement in the Brillouin zone around the Dirac points. In addition, the interlayer coupling modifies the symmetry of the lattice-layer quantum concurrence around a given Dirac point. It produces some distortion on the quantum entanglement profile which follows the same pattern of the isoenergy line distortion in the Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene.",0
2726,2,Gaussian quantum metrology and space-time probes In this thesis we focus on Gaussian quantum metrology in the phase-space formalism and its applications in quantum sensing and the estimation of space-time parameters. We derive new formulae for the optimal estimation of multiple parameters encoded into Gaussian states. We discuss the discontinuous behavior of the figure of merit - the quantum Fisher information. Using derived expressions we devise a practical method of finding optimal probe states for the estimation of Gaussian channels and we illustrate this method on several examples. We show that the temperature of a probe state affects the estimation generically and always appears in the form of four multiplicative factors. We also discuss how well squeezed thermal states perform in the estimation of space-time parameters. Finally we study how the estimation precision changes when two parties exchanging a quantum state with the encoded parameter do not share a reference frame. We show that using a quantum reference frame could counter this effect.,0
2765,2,"Static memory materials We simulate static memory materials on a two-dimensional lattice. The bulk properties of such materials depend on boundary conditions. Considerable information can be stored in various local patterns. We observe local probabilities oscillating with the distance from the boundary. The dependence of the local statistical information on this distance can be described by a linear evolution of classical wave functions, including the superposition principle and classical interference. We speculate that these new phenomena could open new algorithmic possibilities analogous to quantum computing.",0
2880,2,"An Enhanced Symmetry for the $p$-adic Wavelets Wavelet analysis has been extended to the $p$-adic line $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The $p$-adic wavelets are complex valued functions with compact support. As in the case of real wavelets, the construction of the basis functions is recursive, employing scaling and translation. Consequently, wavelets form a representation of the affine group generated by scaling and translation. In addition, $p$-adic wavelets are eigenfunctions of a pseudo-differential operator, as a result of which they turn out to have a larger symmetry group. The enhanced symmetry of the $p$-adic wavelets is demonstrated.",0

From the magneto-transmission data we extracted three distinct cyclotron resonance (CR) energies that are all apparent in the broad band Faraday rotation (FR) spectra. This comprehensive FR-CR data set has allowed us to isolate the response of the bulk states from the intrinsic surface states associated with both the top and bottom surfaces of the film. The FR data uncovered that electron- and hole-type Dirac fermions reside on opposite surfaces of our films, which paves the way for observing many exotic quantum phenomena in topological insulators.",0
3002,2,"Refined open intersection numbers and the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model A study of the intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with boundary was recently initiated in a work of R. Pandharipande, J.P. Solomon and the third author, where they introduced open intersection numbers in genus 0. Their construction was later generalized to all genera by J.P. Solomon and the third author. In this paper we consider a refinement of the open intersection numbers by distinguishing contributions from surfaces with different numbers of boundary components, and we calculate all these numbers. We then construct a matrix model for the generating series of the refined open intersection numbers and conjecture that it is equivalent to the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model. An evidence for the conjecture is presented. Another refinement of the open intersection numbers, which describes the distribution of the boundary marked points on the boundary components, is also discussed.",0
3230,2,"HNType : a diverse trace and migration mechanism in the block based Hierarchical Storage System named HazelNut HazelNut is a block based Hierarchical Storage System, in which logical data blocks are migrated among storage tiers to achieve better I/O performance. In order to choose migrated blocks, data block I/O process is traced to collect enough information for migration algorithms. There are many ways to trace I/O process and implement block migration. However, how to choose trace metrics and design block migration algorithm is a big problem for system designers. To address this problem, a diverse trace and migration mechanism HNType is proposed. HNType consists two parts, one is a diverse trace mechanism named HNType-t, and the other is a diverse migration mechanism named HNType-s. HNType-t abstracts four base elements and trace operation interfaces based on VFS design concept, which makes it feasible to customize specific trace metrics and trace operations; HNType-s presents three ways of data migration, each way of migration can use customized migration algorithms according to predefined prototypes. Based on HNType, A series of tests are conducted about how block migration is affected by different trace metrics, and three conclusions are drawn according to the experiment results. First, trace metrics of access times and access sectors are not linearly correlated, as a result, these two metrics bring different migration result; Second, I/O completion time used as trace metrics is able to improve sequential I/O by at least 10%; Third, access times used as metrics have a tendency of more migrations upwards.",0

Our goal is to explain tensor networks and some associated methods as quickly and as painlessly as possible. Beginning with the key definitions, the graphical tensor network language is presented through examples. We then provide an introduction to matrix product states.

5863,2,"Ground States via Spectral Combing on a Quantum Computer A new method is proposed for determining the ground state wave function of a quantum many-body system on a quantum computer, without requiring an initial trial wave function that has good overlap with the true ground state. The technique of Spectral Combing involves entangling an arbitrary initial wave function with a set of auxiliary qubits governed by a time dependent Hamiltonian, resonantly transferring energy out of the initial state through a plethora of avoided level crossings into the auxiliary system. The number of avoided level crossings grows exponentially with the number of qubits required to represent the Hamiltonian, so that the efficiency of the algorithm does not rely on any particular energy gap being large. We give an explicit construction of the quantum gates required for the realization of this procedure and explore the results of classical simulations of the algorithm on a small quantum computer with up to 8 qubits. We show that for certain systems and comparable results, Spectral Combing requires fewer quantum gates to realize than the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm.",0

We prove an existence and uniqueness result for solutions of these equations, subject to appropriate conditions on the analytical properties of the $Y_n$, in particular the absence of zeros in a strip around the real axis. The matrix $G_{nm}$ must have non-negative real entries, and be irreducible and diagonalisable over $\mathbb{R}$ with spectral radius less than 2. This includes the adjacency matrices of finite Dynkin diagrams, but covers much more as we do not require $G_{nm}$ to be integers. Our results specialise to the constant Y-system, proving existence and uniqueness of a strictly positive solution in that case.",0
6830,2,"Theorems on Entanglement Typicality in Non-equilibrium Dynamics The notion of typicality in statistical mechanics is essential to characterize a macroscopic system. An overwhelming majority of the pure state looks almost identical if we neglect macroscopic non-local correlations, suggesting that thermal equilibrium is the collection of the typical properties. Quantum entanglement, which characterizes a non-local correlation, also has a typical behavior in equilibrium systems. However, it remains elusive whether there is a typical behavior of entanglement in dynamical non-equilibrium systems. To investigate the typicality, we consider a situation where a system in a pure state starts to share entanglement with its environment system due to the interaction between them. Assuming the initial state is randomly chosen from an ensemble of pure states, a criteria for the typicality of the R\'enyi entropies is presented. In addition, it is analytically proven that the second R\'enyi entropy has a typical behavior in two cases. The first one is an energy dissipation process in a multiple-qubit system which is initially in a random pure state in an energy shell. Since the typical behavior is qualitatively the same as the prediction of the Page curve conjecture, it gives the first proof of the Page curve conjecture in a dynamical process. In the second case, the typicality is proven for any dynamics described by a multiple-product of a single-qudit channel when the system is initially in a pure state randomly chosen from the whole Hilbert space. This result shows that entanglement typicality is not a specific feature of energy dissipating processes.",0
7089,2,"Quantized Laplacian growth, II: 1D hydrodynamics of the Loewner density A systematic analytic treatment of fluctuations in Laplacian growth is given. The growth process is regularized by a short-distance cutoff $\hbar$ preventing the cusps production in a finite time. This regularization mechanism generates tiny inevitable fluctuations on a microscale, so that the interface dynamics becomes chaotic. The time evolution of fluctuations can be described by the universal Dyson Brownian motion, which reduces to the complex viscous Burgers equation in the hydrodynamic approximation. Because of the intrinsic instability of the interface dynamics, tiny fluctuations of the interface on a microscale generate universal patterns with well developed fjords and fingers in a long time asymptotic.",0

8200,2,"Doping the holographic Mott insulator Mott insulators form because of strong electron repulsions, being at the heart of strongly correlated electron physics. Conventionally these are understood as classical ""traffic jams"" of electrons described by a short-ranged entangled product ground state. Exploiting the holographic duality, which maps the physics of densely entangled matter onto gravitational black hole physics, we show how Mott-insulators can be constructed departing from entangled non-Fermi liquid metallic states, such as the strange metals found in cuprate superconductors. These ""entangled Mott insulators"" have traits in common with the ""classical"" Mott insulators, such as the formation of Mott gap in the optical conductivity, super-exchange-like interactions, and form ""stripes"" when doped. They also exhibit new properties: the ordering wave vectors are detached from the number of electrons in the unit cell, and the DC resistivity diverges algebraically instead of exponentially as function of temperature. These results may shed light on the mysterious ordering phenomena observed in underdoped cuprates.",0

Once the Jaynes-Cummings ionic interactions are mapped onto a Dirac spinor structure, the elementary tools for computing quantum correlations of two-qubit ionic states are provided. With two-qubit quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its projection onto the direction of an external magnetic field (which lifts the degeneracy of the ion's internal levels), a complete analytical profile of entanglement for the Schr\""odinger cat and Werner states is obtained. Under vacuum noise (during spontaneous emission), the two-qubit entanglement in the Schr\""odinger cat states is shown to vanish asymptotically. Otherwise, the robustness of Werner states is concomitantly identified, with the entanglement content recovered by their noiseless-like evolution. Most importantly, our results point to a firstly reported sudden transition between classical and quantum decay regimes driven by a classical collective noise on the Schr\""odinger cat states, which has been quantified by the geometric discord.",0

10732,2,"Interlayer coherent composite Fermi liquid in Half-filled Landau Level bilayers, a window toward the hidden $\pi$ Berry phase For interacting 2D electrons in the presence of magnetic field at half filling, the system forms a `composite Fermi liquid(CFL)' with emergent Fermi surface and exhibits metallic behavior, based on the standard Halperin, Lee, and Read(HLR) field theory. Recently, Son introduces a composite Dirac theory as the low energy effective description of Half-filled Landau Level. Such theory exhibits particle-hole symmetry and the underlying composite Fermi surface displays a robust $\pi$ Berry phase. In this paper, we start from the bilayer Half-filled Landau Level system where the two composite Fermi surface acquires interlayer coherence and forms bonding/anti-bonding composite fermi sea. The corresponding interlayer coherent composite Fermi liquid(ICCFL) phase provides a straightforward landscape to verify the Dirac nature in Son's theory and extract the hidden Berry phase structure of the composite Fermi surface. The ICCFL phase contains two Fermi surfaces which are detached in most regions but adhesive at two hot spots. Such nematic structure is a consequence of the Berry phase encoded in the Dirac Fermi surface which is absent in HLR theory. Due to the nematicity in ICCFL, the system supports half-quantum vortex with deconfined $\frac{\pi}{2}$ gauge flux and the phase transition toward ICCFL contains a Lifshitz criticality with $z=3$ dynamical exponent. In addition, the exciton order parameter carries topological spin number so the ICCFL contains a unique Wen-Zee term which connects EM response with the background geometry curvature.",0
11454,2,"Efficient Quantum Pseudorandomness with Nearly Time-Independent Hamiltonian Dynamics Quantum randomness is an essential key to understanding the dynamics of complex many-body systems and also a powerful tool for quantum engineering. However, exact realizations of quantum randomness take an extremely long time and are infeasible in many-body systems, leading to the notion of quantum pseudorandomness, also known as unitary designs. Here, to explore microscopic dynamics of generating quantum pseudorandomness in many-body systems, we provide new efficient constructions of unitary designs and propose a design Hamiltonian, a random Hamiltonian of which dynamics always forms a unitary design after a threshold time. The new constructions are based on the alternate applications of random potentials in the generalized position and momentum spaces, and we provide explicit quantum circuits generating quantum pseudorandomness significantly more efficient than previous ones. We then provide a design Hamiltonian in disordered systems with periodically changing spin-glass-type interactions. The design Hamiltonian generates quantum pseudorandomness in a constant time even in the system composed of a large number of spins. We also point out the close relationship between the design Hamiltonian and quantum chaos.",0
11995,2,"Topological quantum chemistry The past decade's apparent success in predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of topological insulators (TIs) and semimetals masks a fundamental shortcoming: out of 200,000 stoichiometric compounds extant in material databases, only several hundred of them are topologically nontrivial. Are TIs that esoteric, or does this reflect a fundamental problem with the current piecemeal approach to finding them? To address this, we propose a new and complete electronic band theory that highlights the link between topology and local chemical bonding, and combines this with the conventional band theory of electrons. Topological Quantum Chemistry is a description of the universal global properties of all possible band structures and materials, comprised of a graph theoretical description of momentum space and a dual group theoretical description in real space. We classify the possible band structures for all 230 crystal symmetry groups that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically nontrivial.

We obtain the Fourier series of modular graph functions of arbitrary weight $w$ and two-loop order. The motivation for this work is to develop a deeper understanding of the origin of the algebraic identities between modular graph functions which have been discovered recently, and of the relation between the existence of these identities and the occurrence of cusp forms. We show that the constant Fourier mode, as a function of the modulus $\tau$, consists of a Laurent polynomial in $y = \pi \, {\rm Im} (\tau)$ of degree $(w,1-w)$, plus a contribution which decays exponentially as $y \to \infty$. The Laurent polynomial is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the top term $y^w$, and lower order terms $\zeta (2k+1) y^{w-2k-1}$ for $1\leq k \leq w-1$, as well as terms $\zeta (2w-2\ell-3) \zeta (2\ell+1)y^{2-w}$ for $1 \leq \ell \leq w-3$.

By processing multiple right-hand sides simultaneously we can alleviate many of the performance issues of the default single right-hand-side setup. The main improvements are as follows: By combining multiple right-hand sides the message size for off-chip communication is larger, which leads to better utilization of the network bandwidth. Many matrix-vector products are replaced by matrix-matrix products, leading to better cache reuse. The synchronization overhead inflicted by on-chip parallelization (threading), which is becoming crucial on many-core architectures such as the Intel Xeon Phi, is effectively reduced.

The analogous mass term for charge-density wave formation above a critical nearest-neighbor repulsion, on the other hand, would introduce a fermion sign problem. The competition between the two and the phase diagram in the space of the two coouplings can however be studied in simulations without explicit sublattice symmetry breaking. Our results compare qualitatively well with the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. We furthermore demonstrate how spin-symmetry breaking by the Euclidean time discretization can be avoided also, when using an improved fermion action based on an exponetial transfer matrix with exact sublattice symmetry.",0
20818,2,"On the block structure of the quantum R-matrix in the three-strand braids Quantum $\mathcal{R}$-matrices are the building blocks for the colored HOMFLY polynomials. In the case of three-strand braids with an identical finite-dimensional irreducible representation $T$ of $SU_q(N)$ associated with each strand one needs two matrices: $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$. They are related by the Racah matrices $\mathcal{R}_2 = \mathcal{U} \mathcal{R}_1 \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$. Since we can always choose the basis so that $\mathcal{R}_1$ is diagonal, the problem is reduced to evaluation of $\mathcal{R}_2$-matrices. This paper is one more step on the road to simplification of such calculations. We found out and proved for some cases that $\mathcal{R}_2$-matrices could be transformed into a block-diagonal ones. The essential condition is that there is a pair of accidentally coinciding eigenvalues among eigenvalues of $\mathcal{R}_1$-matrix.

Such a description for generalized K\""ahler geometry has been sought since it was discovered in 1984. We show that a generalized K\""ahler structure of symplectic type is determined by a pair of holomorphic Poisson manifolds, a holomorphic symplectic Morita equivalence between them, and the choice of a positive Lagrangian brane bisection, which depends locally on only a single real-valued function, which we call the generalized K\""ahler potential. Our solution draws upon, and specializes to, the many results in the physics literature which solve the problem under the assumption (which we do not make) that the Poisson structures involved have constant rank. To solve the problem we make use of, and generalize, two main tools: the first is the notion of symplectic Morita equivalence, developed by Weinstein and Xu to study Poisson manifolds; the second is Donaldson's interpretation of a K\""ahler metric as a real Lagrangian submanifold in a deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle.",0
23831,2,"Complex Lipschitz structures and bundles of complex Clifford modules Let $(M,g)$ be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature $(p,q)$. We construct mutually quasi-inverse equivalences between the groupoid of bundles of weakly-faithful complex Clifford modules on $(M,g)$ and the groupoid of reduced complex Lipschitz structures on $(M,g)$. As an application, we show that $(M,g)$ admits a bundle of irreducible complex Clifford modules if and only if it admits either a $Spin^{c}(p,q)$ structure (when $p+q$ is odd) or a $Pin^{c}(p,q)$ structure (when $p+q$ is even). When $p-q\equiv_8 3,4,6, 7$, we compare with the classification of bundles of irreducible real Clifford modules which we obtained in previous work. The results obtained in this note form a counterpart of the classification of bundles of faithful complex Clifford modules which was previously given by T. Friedrich and A. Trautman.",0
24504,2,"Critically excited states with enhanced memory and pattern recognition capacities in quantum brain networks: Lesson from black holes We implement a mechanism - originally proposed as a model for the large memory storage capacity of black holes - in quantum neural networks and show that an exponentially increased capacity of pattern storage and recognition is achieved in certain critically excited states, without involvement of synaptic plasticity. We consider a simple network of N interconnected quantum neurons with weak excitatory synaptic connections. We show that for frozen synaptic weights there exist the critical states of enhanced memory storage capacity. These states are achieved thanks to the high excitation levels of some of the neurons, which - despite of feeble synaptic connections - dramatically lower the response threshold of the remaining weaker-excited neurons. As a results, the latter neurons acquire a capacity to store an exponentially large number of patterns within a narrow energy gap. The stored patterns can be recognized and retrieved with perfect response under the influence of arbitrarily soft input stimuli. In sharp contrast, under the same stimuli the recall is absent in the ground-state of the system. The lesson is that the state with the highest micro-state entropy and memory storage capacity is not necessarily a local minimum of energy, but rather an excited critical state. The considered phenomenon has a smooth classical limit and can serve for achieving an enhanced memory storage capacity in classical brain networks.",0

With utility in mind, in this paper we study these structures at the rational level and by considering Lie groups as a starting point for defining each of the higher structures, making close connection to pi -structures. We indicatively call these (rational) Spin-Fivebrane and Spin-Ninebrane structures. We study the space of such structures and characterize their variations, which reveal interesting effects whereby variations of higher structures are arranged to systematically involve lower ones. We also study the homotopy type of the gauge group corresponding to bundles equipped with the higher rational structures that we define.",0
26776,2,"Classification of Module Categories for $SO(3)_{2m}$ The main goal of this paper is to classify $\ast$-module categories for the $SO(3)_{2m}$ modular tensor category. This is done by classifying $SO(3)_{2m}$ nimrep graphs and cell systems, and in the process we also classify the $SO(3)$ modular invariants. There are module categories of type $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{E}$ and their conjugates. These come with a multiplicity from the centre of $SU(2)$, but there are no orbifold (or type $\mathcal{D}$) module categories. We present a construction of a subfactor with principal graph given by the fusion rules of the fundamental generator of the $SO(3)_{2m}$ modular category.

27683,2,"Categorical Structures on Bundle Gerbes and Higher Geometric Prequantisation We present a construction of a 2-Hilbert space of sections of a bundle gerbe, a suitable candidate for a prequantum 2-Hilbert space in higher geometric quantisation. We introduce a direct sum on the morphism categories in the 2-category of bundle gerbes and show that these categories are cartesian monoidal and abelian. Endomorphisms of the trivial bundle gerbe, or higher functions, carry the structure of a rig-category, which acts on generic morphism categories of bundle gerbes. We continue by presenting a categorification of the hermitean metric on a hermitean line bundle. This is achieved by introducing a functorial dual that extends the dual of vector bundles to morphisms of bundle gerbes, and constructing a two-variable adjunction for the aforementioned rig-module category structure on morphism categories. Its right internal hom is the module action, composed by taking the dual of higher functions, while the left internal hom is interpreted as a bundle gerbe metric. Sections of bundle gerbes are defined as morphisms from the trivial bundle gerbe to a given bundle gerbe. The resulting categories of sections carry a rig-module structure over the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. A suitable definition of 2-Hilbert spaces is given, modifying previous definitions by the use of two-variable adjunctions. We prove that the category of sections of a bundle gerbe fits into this framework, thus obtaining a 2-Hilbert space of sections. In particular, this can be constructed for prequantum bundle gerbes in problems of higher geometric quantisation. We define a dimensional reduction functor and show that the categorical structures introduced on bundle gerbes naturally reduce to their counterparts on hermitean line bundles with connections. In several places in this thesis, we provide examples, making 2-Hilbert spaces of sections and dimensional reduction very explicit.",0

The geometry of heavy particles is described in variables of distance $r$ from nucleus $a$ to antiproton, distance $R$ from the center of mass of the $(\bar{p} - a)$ pair to $\mathrm{He}$ atom containing nucleus $b$, and an angle $\theta$ between $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{R}$. The potential $V(R,r,\cos\theta)$ of the interaction between $\mathrm{He}$ atom and a $\bar{p} - a$ subsystem involves a total energy of two electrons in the field of three heavy particles and Coulomb interactions of the $b$ nucleus with antiproton and the $a$ nucleus. The expansion of this potential in terms of Legendre polynomials $\mathrm{P}_k(\cos\theta)$ is obtained. Matrices of the multipole terms $V^k(r,R)$ ($k=0,1,2$) are obtained in the basis of antiprotonic helium ion states. The results are compared with the model potential that was used earlier in the calculations of collisional Stark transitions of $(\mathrm{\bar{p}He}^{2+})$ ion.Total cross sections of collisional Stark transitions obtained with the PES potentials exceed the model results by 15 - 20\% at $E \leq 12$ K.",0

28552,2,"Analytical Prediction of Reflection Coefficients for Wave Absorbing Layers A theory is presented which analytically predicts the reflection coefficients for absorbing layers. In this manner, the absorbing layer parameters can be tuned before running the actual simulations, to ensure optimum absorption for every case. The validity of the theory is demonstrated in finite-volume-based flow simulations for pressure waves in liquid water and in an ideal gas. The theory requires as input the wavelength {\lambda} and the wave angular frequency {\omega} of the wave entering the layer. Apart from this, the absorbing layer behavior theoretically does not depend on the medium (gas, liquid, solid) or on the numerical solution approach (finite-volume method, boundary element method, etc.), as long as the wave propagation is described by the wave equation. Thus wide application to absorbing layer approaches in many fields is expected. The theory is given for one- and two-dimensional wave propagation. The results show that for many practical two- and three-dimensional wave problems, one-dimensional theory suffices to optimally tune the absorbing layer parameters.",0
28732,2,"Entanglement structure of current driven quantum many-body systems When an extended system is coupled at its opposite boundaries to two reservoirs at different temperatures or chemical potentials, it cannot achieve a global thermal equilibrium and is instead driven to a set of current carrying non-equilibrium states. Motivated by developments in the understanding of thermalization in closed quantum many-body systems, we find conditions under which such current-driven systems can achieve, or violate, local thermal equilibrium, by investigating their entropy, mutual information, and entanglement at long times. We focus on a specific model consisting of a two-parameter family of random unitary circuits acting locally on a chain of spin-1/2s (equivalently, qubits) that exhibits quantum chaotic behavior in most of its parameter space. The only conserved quantity is the $z$ component of the total magnetization of the spins. We choose the model so that for all parameter values the time-averaged correlation functions agree and are close to local equilibrium. However, computing the total von Neumann entropy of the system shows that there are in fact three distinct ""phases"" of the driven problem, with local equilibrium only emerging in the quantum chaotic regime, while one of the other phases exhibits volume-law mutual information and entanglement. We extend these results to the three-dimensional, non-interacting Anderson model in the diffusive regime, showing that the non-equilibrium steady-state for fermions realizes the volume-law mutual information phase of the random circuit. Our results suggest a generic picture for the emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven quantum chaotic systems, as well as provide insights into methods to stabilize highly-entangled many-body states out of equilibrium.",0

We prove that any reductive homogeneous symplectic manifold (of any dimension) admits an invariant torsion free symplectic connection, i.e., it is a homogeneous Fedosov manifold, and give conditions for uniqueness of the Fedosov structure. Finally, we show that any nilpotent symplectic Lie group (of any dimension) admits a natural invariant Fedosov structure which is Ricci-flat.",0
28948,2,"Multipartite entanglement in spin chains and the Hyperdeterminant A way to characterize multipartite entanglement in pure states of a spin chain with $n$ sites and local dimension $d$ is by means of the Cayley hyperdeterminant. The latter quantity is a polynomial constructed with the components of the wave function $\psi_{i_1, \dots, i_n}$ which is invariant under local unitary transformation. For spin 1/2 chains (i.e. $d=2$) with $n=2$ and $n=3$ sites, the hyperdeterminant coincides with the concurrence and the tangle respectively. In this paper we consider spin chains with $n=4$ sites where the hyperdeterminant is a polynomial of degree 24 containing around $2.8 \times 10^6$ terms. This huge object can be written in terms of more simple polynomials $S$ and $T$ of degrees 8 and 12 respectively. In this paper we compute $S$, $T$ and the hyperdeterminant for eigenstates of the following spin chain Hamiltonians: the transverse Ising model, the XXZ Heisenberg model and the Haldane-Shastry model. Those invariants are also computed for random states, the ground states of random matrix Hamiltonians in the Wigner-Dyson Gaussian ensembles and the quadripartite entangled states defined by Verstraete et al. in 2002. Finally, we propose a generalization of the hyperdeterminant to thermal density matrices.",0

We define cyclotomic $\mathfrak {g}$ -opers over the Riemann sphere $\mathbb {P}^1$ as gauge equivalence classes of $\mathfrak {g}$ -valued connections of a certain form, equivariant under actions of the cyclic group $\mathbb {Z}/ T\mathbb {Z}$ on $\mathfrak {g}$ and $\mathbb {P}^1$ . It reduces to the usual notion of $\mathfrak {g}$ -opers when $T = 1$ . We also extend the notion of Miura $\mathfrak {g}$ -opers to the cyclotomic setting. To any cyclotomic Miura $\mathfrak {g}$ -oper $\nabla $ , we associate a corresponding cyclotomic $\mathfrak {g}$ -oper. Let $\nabla $ have residue at the origin given by a $\nu $ -invariant rational dominant coweight $\check{\lambda }_0$ and be monodromy-free on a cover of $\mathbb {P}^1$ . We prove that the subset of all cyclotomic Miura $\mathfrak {g}$ -opers associated with the same cyclotomic $\mathfrak {g}$ -oper as $\nabla $ is isomorphic to the $\vartheta $ -invariant subset of the full flag variety of the adjoint group G of $\mathfrak {g}$ , where the automorphism $\vartheta $ depends on $\nu $ , T and $\check{\lambda }_0$ . The big cell of the latter is isomorphic to $N^\vartheta $ , the $\vartheta $ -invariant subgroup of the unipotent subgroup $N \subset G$ , which we identify with those cyclotomic Miura $\mathfrak {g}$ -opers whose residue at the origin is the same as that of $\nabla $ . In particular, the cyclotomic generation procedure recently introduced in Varchenko and Young (Sigma 11(091), 2015) is interpreted as taking $\nabla $ to other cyclotomic Miura $\mathfrak {g}$ -opers corresponding to elements of $N^\vartheta $ associated with simple root generators. We motivate the introduction of cyclotomic $\mathfrak {g}$ -opers by formulating two conjectures which relate them to the cyclotomic Gaudin model of Vicedo and Young (Commun Math Phys 343(3):971–1024, 2016).",0

Furthermore, the experimental uniaxial strained graphene for light transmittance shows two features, namely the modification of the $\cos^2\theta$ law and the decrease of the amplitude of the oscillations with the polarization angle θ, which can be well accommodated within the theoretical analysis used here and provide further evidence of the validity of using QFT in curved space to understand two-dimensional materials.",0

We follow the strategy of Mozgovoy and Schiffmann for counting Higgs bundles over finite fields.

We show that the low-lying elementary condensate excitations are analogous to the rotons in superfluid$^{4}$He. We argue that the rotons-like excitations account for the specific heat anomaly at the critical temperature. We discuss and compare with experimental observations the London penetration length, the Abrikosov vortices, the upper and lower critical magnetic fields, and the critical current density. We give arguments to explain the origin of the Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets. We investigate the nodal gap in the cuprate superconductors and discuss both the doping and temperature dependence of the nodal gap. We suggest that the nodal gap is responsible for the doping dependence of the so-called nodal Fermi velocity detected in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies. We discuss the thermodynamics of the nodal quasielectron liquid and their role in the low temperature specific heat. We propose that the ubiquitous presence of charge density wave in hole doped cuprate superconductors in the pseudogap region originates from instabilities of the nodal quasielectrons driven by the interaction with the planar CuO$_{2}$ lattice.

Because the total sum of sequential weak values of multitime projection operators for a complete set of orthogonal quantum histories is unity, complete sets of weak values could be interpreted in agreement with the standard quantum mechanical picture.

We demonstrate this phenomenon in the context of the deconfined critical point between a Neel state and a valence bond solid in an $S =1/2$ square lattice antiferromagnet, and compare it to the case of $S=1/2$ honeycomb lattice where no anomaly is present. We also point out that new anomalies, unrelated to the microscopic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, can emerge prohibiting the existence of a trivial gapped state in the immediate vicinity of critical points or phases. For instance, no translationally invariant weak perturbation of the $S = 1/2$ gapless spin chain can open up a trivial gap even if the spin-rotation symmetry is explicitly broken. The same result holds for the $S =1/2$ deconfined critical point on a square lattice.",0

The Navier-Stokes equation has an extra force term which reflects the non-commutativity of the space, being proportional to $\theta^2$. This parameter $\theta$ is related to the minimum size of fluid particles which is implied by the uncertainty principle, $\Delta x \Delta y \ge \theta/2$. To see the effect of this parameter on the flow, following situation is considered. An obstacle placed in the middle of the stream, separates the flow into small slit and large slit, but the flow is joined afterwards in the down stream. For the Reynolds number 700, the behavior of the flows with and without $\theta$ is observed to differ, and the difference is seen to be correlated to the difference of the activity of vortices in the down stream. The oscillation of the flow rate at the small slit diminishes after the certain time in the usual flow when the ""two attached eddies"" appear. In the non-commutative flow this two attached eddies appear from the beginning and the behavior of the flows does not fluctuate largely.

38239,2,"Infinite Range Correlations in Non-Equilibrium Quantum Systems and Their Possible Experimental Realizations We consider systems that start from and/or end in thermodynamic equilibrium while experiencing a finite rate of change of their energy density or of other intensive quantities $q$ at intermediate times. We demonstrate that at these times, during which the global intensive quantities $q$ vary, the size of the associated covariance, the connected pair correlator $|G_{ij}| = |\langle q_{i} q_{j} \rangle - \langle q_{i} \rangle \langle q_{j} \rangle|$, between any two (arbitrarily far separated) sites $i$ and $j$ is, on average, finite. This non-vanishing character of the connected correlations for asymptotically distant sites also applies to theories with purely local interactions. In simple models, these correlations may be traced to the generic volume law entanglement of finite temperature states. Once the global mean of $q$ no longer changes, the average of $|G_{ij}|$ over all spatial separations $|i-j|$ may tend to zero. However, when the equilibration times are significant (e.g., as in a glass that is not in true thermodynamic equilibrium yet in which the energy density (or temperature) reaches a final steady state value), these long range correlations may persist also long after $q$ ceases to change. We briefly discuss possible experimental implications of our findings and speculate on their potential realization in glasses (where a prediction of a theory based on the effect that we describe here suggests a universal collapse of the viscosity that agrees with all published viscosity measurements) and non-Fermi liquids.",0

In the proposed two-fold scheme, the BS performs semi-persistent scheduling and allocates time-frequency resources in a non-orthogonal manner while the vehicles autonomously perform distributed power control with iterative signaling control. We formulate the centralized scheduling and resource allocation problem as equivalent to a multi-dimensional stable roommate matching problem, in which the users and time/frequency resources are considered as disjoint sets of objects to be matched with each other. We then develop a novel rotation matching algorithm, which converges to an $L$-rotation stable matching after a limited number of iterations. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional orthogonal multiple access scheme in terms of the access latency and reliability.",0
39165,2,"Parity Deformed Jaynes-Cummings Model: ""Robust Maximally Entangled States"" A parity deformed Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) is introduced, which describes an interaction of a two-level atom with a $\lambda$-deformed quantized field. In the rotating wave approximation (RWA), all eigen-values and eigen-functions of this model are obtained exactly. Assuming that initially the field is prepared in the Wigner cat state (WCS) and the two-level atom is in the excited state, it has been shown that the atomic Rabi oscillations exhibit a quasi-periodic behavior in the collapse and revival patterns. The influence of the deformation parameter on the time evolution of non-classical features of the radiation field such as the sub-Poissonian statistics and squeezing effect are also analyzed. Interestingly, the main finding here is that we can realize maximally entangled atom-field states. In this note it is shown that the high fidelity is possible in the weak coupling regime, while the deformation parameter becomes large values.",0

40603,2,"Geometry on Lie algebroids I: compatible geometric structures on the base The object of our study is a Lie algebroid $A$ or a Cartan-Lie algebroid $(A,\nabla)$ (a Lie algebroid with a compatible connection) over a base manifold $M$ equipped with appropriately compatible geometrical structures. The main focus is on a Riemannian base $(M,g)$, but we also consider symplectic and generalized Riemannian structures. For the Riemannian case, we show that the compatibility implies that the foliation induced by the Lie algebroid is a Riemannian foliation; thus, in particular, if the leaf space $Q = M/\!\sim$ is smooth, $Q$ permits a metric such that the quotient projection is a Riemannian submersion. For other structures on $M$ with a smooth leaf space $Q$, the reduced geometrical type on $Q$ can be different: for example, $(M,\omega)$ symplectic provides in general only a symplectic realization of a Poisson manifold $(Q,\mathcal{P})$. Building upon a result of del Hoyo and Fernandes, we prove that any Lie algebroid integrating to a proper Lie groupoid admits a compatible Riemannian base. We also show that, given an arbitrary connection on an anchored bundle, there is a unique Cartan connection on the corresponding free Lie algebroid.",0

41223,2,"A Numerical Approach to Optimal Coherent Quantum LQG Controller Design Using Gradient Descent This paper is concerned with coherent quantum linear quadratic Gaussian (CQLQG) control. The problem is to find a stabilizing measurement-free quantum controller for a quantum plant so as to minimize a mean square cost for the fully quantum closed-loop system. The plant and controller are open quantum systems interconnected through bosonic quantum fields. In comparison with the observation-actuation structure of classical controllers, coherent quantum feedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics. The plant and controller variables satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of a quantum harmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to such oscillators, these QSDEs must satisfy physical realizability (PR) conditions in the form of quadratic constraints on the state-space matrices, reflecting the CCR preservation in time. The symmetry of the problem is taken into account by introducing equivalence classes of coherent quantum controllers generated by symplectic similarity transformations. We discuss a modified gradient flow, which is concerned with norm-balanced realizations of controllers. A line-search gradient descent algorithm with adaptive stepsize selection is proposed for the numerical solution of the CQLQG control problem. The algorithm finds a local minimum of the LQG cost over the parameters of the Hamiltonian and coupling operators of a stabilizing coherent quantum controller, thus taking the PR constraints into account. A convergence analysis of the algorithm is presented. Numerical examples of designing locally optimal CQLQG controllers are provided in order to demonstrate the algorithm performance.",0
41312,2,"Generalized Permutohedra, Scattering Amplitudes, and a Cubic Three-Fold In this note, we apply combinatorial techniques from our Ph.D. thesis to study how generalized permutohedra may be represented functionally on Parke-Tayor factors and related rational functions. In any functional representation of polyhedral cones, in general certain homological information may be lost. The combinatorial relations of the Parke-Taylor factors lift homologically to generalized permutohedra. The 6-particle case contains several related layers of interesting geometric data: the Newton polytope for the polynomial numerator lifts the permutohedron in three variables, which is a hexagon, and the fraction itself provides a functional representation of certain neighborhoods of a vertex of a 5-dimensional weight permutohedron. The lift from fraction to generalized permutohedron was derived by comparing functional representations. We observe additionally that the numerator and its permutations satisfy a degree 3 polynomial relation which defines a classical projective variety known as the Segre cubic. We include in an extended Appendix selected Mathematica code which can be used to verify our computations independently.",0

Dissipation is considered through the coupling of the exciton and photon fields to two independent photonic and excitonic baths. As such, this theory allows to describe more intricate decay mechanisms that depend dynamically on the state of the system, such as a direct upper-polariton lifetime, that is motivated from experiments. We show that the dynamical equations in the Keldysh framework otherwise follow the same Josephson--like equations of motions than the standard master equation approach, that is however limited to simple decay channels. We also discuss the stability of the dynamic and reconsider the criterion of strong coupling in the presence of upper polariton decay.",0
41512,2,"Instantaneous braids and Dehn twists in topologically ordered states A defining feature of topologically ordered states of matter is the existence of locally indistinguishable states on spaces with non-trivial topology. These degenerate states form a representation of the mapping class group (MCG) of the space, which is generated by braids of defects or anyons, and by Dehn twists along non-contractible cycles. These operations can be viewed as fault-tolerant logical gates in the context of topological quantum error correcting codes. Here we show that braids and Dehn twists can in general be implemented by a constant depth quantum circuit, with a depth that is independent of code distance $d$ and system size. The circuit consists of a constant depth local quantum circuit (LQC) implementing a local geometry deformation of the quantum state, followed by a permutation on (relabelling of) the qubits. We further show that (i) applying a given braid or Dehn twist $k$ times can be achieved with $\mathcal{O}(\log k)$ time overhead, independent of code distance and system size, which implies an exponential speedup for certain logical gate sequences by trading space for time, and (ii) an arbitrary element of the MCG can be implemented by a constant depth (independent of $d$) LQC followed by a permutation, where in this case the range of interactions of the LQC grows with the number of generators in the presentation of the group element. Applying these results to certain non-Abelian codes implies that a fault-tolerant universal gate set can be achieved with constant time overhead by using a local quantum circuit together with qubit permutations. This provides a factor of $d$ improvement over other approaches in the asymptotic scaling of space-time overhead for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.",0
41538,2,"Gaussian quantum resource theories We develop a general framework characterizing the structure and properties of quantum resource theories for continuous-variable Gaussian states and Gaussian operations, establishing methods for their description and quantification. We show in particular that, under a few intuitive and physically-motivated assumptions on the set of free states, no Gaussian quantum resource can be distilled with Gaussian free operations, even when an unlimited supply of the resource state is available. This places fundamental constraints on state transformations in all such Gaussian resource theories. Our methods rely on the definition of a general Gaussian resource quantifier whose value does not change when multiple copies are considered. We discuss in particular the applications to quantum entanglement, where we extend previously known results by showing that Gaussian entanglement cannot be distilled even with Gaussian operations preserving the positivity of the partial transpose, as well as to other Gaussian resources such as steering and optical nonclassicality. A unified semidefinite programming representation of all these resources is provided.",0
41551,2,"Universal Scaling Laws for Correlation Spreading in Quantum Systems with Short- and Long-Range Interactions We study the spreading of information in a wide class of quantum systems, with variable-range interactions. We show that, after a quench, it generally features a double structure, whose scaling laws are related to a set of universal microscopic exponents that we determine. When the system supports excitations with a finite maximum velocity, the spreading shows a twofold ballistic behavior. While the correlation edge spreads with a velocity equal to twice the maximum group velocity, the dominant correlation maxima propagate with a different velocity that we derive. When the maximum group velocity diverges, as realizable with long-range interactions, the correlation edge features a slower-than-ballistic motion. The motion of the maxima is, instead, either faster-than-ballistic, for gapless systems, or ballistic, for gapped systems. The phenomenology that we unveil here provides a unified framework, which encompasses existing experimental observations with ultracold atoms and ions. It also paves the way to simple extensions of those experiments to observe the structures we describe in their full generality.",0

44282,2,"Quantum transitions and quantum entanglement from Dirac-like dynamics simulated by trapped ions Quantum transition probabilities and quantum entanglement for two-qubit states of a four-level trapped ion quantum system are computed for time-evolving ionic states driven by Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians with interactions mapped onto a SU(2)⊗SU(2) group structure. Using the correspondence of the method of simulating a 3+1 dimensional Dirac-like Hamiltonian for bispinor particles into a single trapped ion, one preliminarily obtains the analytical tools for describing ionic state transition probabilities as a typical quantum oscillation feature. For Dirac-like structures driven by generalized Poincaré classes of coupling potentials, one also identifies the SU(2)⊗SU(2) internal degrees of freedom corresponding to intrinsic parity and spin polarization as an adaptive platform for computing the quantum entanglement between the internal quantum subsystems which define two-qubit ionic states. The obtained quantum correlational content is then translated into the quantum entanglement of two-qubit ionic states with quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its projection onto the direction of the trapping magnetic field. Experimentally, the controllable parameters simulated by ion traps can be mapped into a Dirac-like system in the presence of an electrostatic field which, in this case, is associated to ionic carrier interactions. Besides exhibiting a complete analytical profile for ionic quantum transitions and quantum entanglement, our results indicate that carrier interactions actively drive an overall suppression of the quantum entanglement.",0
45653,2,"Finding Critical States of Enhanced Memory Capacity in Attractive Cold Bosons We discuss a class of quantum theories which exhibit a sharply increased memory storage capacity due to emergent gapless degrees of freedom. Their realization, both theoretical and experimental, is of great interest. On the one hand, such systems are motivated from a quantum information point of view. On the other hand, they can provide a framework for simulating systems with enhanced capacity of pattern storage, such as black holes and neural networks. In this paper, we develop an analytic method that enables us to find critical states with increased storage capabilities in a generic system of cold bosons with weak attractive interactions. The enhancement of memory capacity arises when the occupation number $N$ of certain modes reaches a critical level. Such modes, via negative energy couplings, assist others in becoming effectively gapless. This leads to degenerate microstates labeled by the occupation numbers of the nearly-gapless modes. In the limit of large $N$, they become exactly gapless and their decoherence time diverges. In this way, a system becomes an ideal storer of quantum information. We demonstrate our method on a prototype model of $N$ attractive cold bosons contained in a one-dimensional box with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Although we limit ourselves to a truncated system, we observe a rich structure of quantum phases with a critical point of enhanced memory capacity.",0

47363,2,"Oriented polar molecules in a solid inert-gas matrix: a proposed method for measuring the electric dipole moment of the electron We propose a very sensitive method for measuring the electric dipole moment of the electron using polar molecules embedded in a cryogenic solid matrix of inert-gas atoms. The polar molecules can be oriented in the $\hat{\rm{z}}$ direction by an applied electric field, as has recently been demonstrated by Park, et al. [Angewandte Chemie {\bf 129}, 1066 (2017)]. The trapped molecules are prepared into a state which has its electron spin perpendicular to $\hat{\rm{z}}$, and a magnetic field along $\hat{\rm{z}}$ causes precession of this spin. An electron electric dipole moment $d_e$ would affect this precession due to the up to 100~GV/cm effective electric field produced by the polar molecule. The large number of polar molecules that can be embedded in a matrix, along with the expected long coherence times for the precession, allows for the possibility of measuring $d_e$ to an accuracy that surpasses current measurements by many orders of magnitude. Because the matrix can inhibit molecular rotations and lock the orientation of the polar molecules, it may not be necessary to have an electric field present during the precession. The proposed technique can be applied using a variety of polar molecules and inert gases, which, along with other experimental variables, should allow for careful study of systematic uncertainties in the measurement.",0

A modified Backus-Gilbert method is introduced to obtain the spectral functions via numerical analytic continuation. We directly compute the single-particle density of states which demonstrates the formation of Hubbard bands in the strongly correlated phase.

Specifically for parameters relating to TlCuCl$_3$, we find an energy ($\Delta_H$) to width ($\Gamma_H$) ratio $\Delta_H/\Gamma_H\sim500$, making this the narrowest predicted Higgs mode in a condensed matter system, some two orders of magnitude `narrower' than the sharpest condensed matter Higgs observed so far.",0

48283,2,"Interacting nodal-line semimetal: Proximity effect and spontaneous symmetry breaking Effects of short-range electronic interactions in a three-dimensional line-node semimetal that supports linearly dispersing quasiparticles around an isolated loop in the Brillouin zone are discussed. Due to vanishing density of states [ϱ(E)∼|E|], various orderings in the bulk of the system, such as the antiferromagnet and charge-density wave, set in for sufficiently strong on-site (U) and nearest-neighbor (V) repulsions, respectively. While onset of these two orderings from the semimetallic phase takes place through continuous quantum phase transitions, a first-order transition separates two ordered phases. By contrast, topologically protected drumhead shaped surface states can undergo charge or spin orderings, depending on relative strength of U and V, even when they are sufficiently weak. Such surface orderings as well as weak long-range Coulomb interaction can be conducive to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the bulk for weaker interactions.

49802,2,"The first cohomology, derivations and the reductivity of a (meromorphic open-string) vertex algebra We give a criterion for the complete reducibility of modules of finite length satisfying a composability condition for a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra $V$ using the first cohomology of the algebra. For a $V$-bimodule $M$, let $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)$ be the first cohomology of $V$ with the coefficients in $M$. If $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)= 0$ for every $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $V$-bimodule $M$, or equivalently, if every derivation from $V$ to every $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $V$-bimodule $M$ is inner, then every $V$-module of finite-length satisfying a composability condition is completely reducible. In particular, since a lower-bounded $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebra $V$ is a special meromorphic open-string vertex algebra and left $V$-modules are in fact what has been called generalized $V$-modules with lower-bounded weights (or lower-bounded generalized $V$-modules), this result provides a cohomological criterion for the complete reducibility of lower-bounded generalized modules of finite length for such a vertex algebra. We conjecture that the converse of the main theorem above is also true. We also prove that when a grading-restricted vertex algebra $V$ contains a subalgebra satisfying some familiar conditions, the composability condition for grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules always holds and we need $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)= 0$ only for every $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $V$-bimodule $M$ generated by a grading-restricted subspace in our complete reducibility theorem.",0
50028,2,"Quantum Kinetic Theory of the Chiral Anomaly We present a general quantum kinetic theory of low-field magnetotransport in weakly disordered crystals that accounts fully for the interplay between electric-field-induced interband coherence, Bloch-state scattering, and an external magnetic field. The quantum kinetic equation we derive for the Bloch-state density matrix naturally incorporates the momentum-space Berry phase effects whose influence on Bloch-state wave-packet dynamics is normally incorporated into transport theory in an ad hoc manner. The Berry phase correction to the momentum-space density of states in the presence of an external magnetic field implied by semiclassical wave-packet dynamics is captured by our theory as an intrinsic density-matrix response to a magnetic field. We propose a simple and general procedure for expanding the linear response of the Bloch-state density matrix to an electric field in powers of magnetic field. As an illustration, we apply our theory to magnetotransport in Weyl semimetals. We show that the chiral anomaly (positive magnetoconductivity quadratic in magnetic field) that appears when separate Fermi surface pockets surround distinct Weyl points survives only when intervalley scattering is very weak compared to intravalley scattering.",0

The root cause is that prices are positive and have skewed, long-tailed distributions, which coupled with volatility results in a long-run asymmetry. This relates to bubbles in stock prices, which we discuss using a simple binomial tree model, without resorting to the stochastic calculus machinery. We illustrate empirical properties of the aforesaid ratio. Log of market cap and sectors appear to be relevant explanatory variables for this ratio, while price-to-book ratio (or its log) is not.

51797,2,"Hodge and Prym tau functions, Jenkins-Strebel differentials and combinatorial model of $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ The principal goal of the paper is to apply the approach inspired by the theory of integrable systems to construct explicit sections of line bundles over the combinatorial model of the moduli space of pointed Riemann surfaces based on Jenkins-Strebel differentials. The line bundles are tensor products of the determinants of the Hodge or Prym vector bundles with the standard tautological line bundles $\mathcal L_j$ and the sections are constructed in terms of tau functions. The combinatorial model is interpreted as the real slice of a complex analytic moduli space of quadratic differentials where the phase of each tau-function provides a section of a circle bundle. The phase of the ratio of the Prym and Hodge tau functions gives a section of the $\kappa_1$-circle bundle. By evaluating the increment of the phase around co-dimension $2$ sub-complexes, we identify the Poincar\'e\ dual cycles to the Chern classes of the corresponding line bundles: they are expressed explicitly as combination of Witten's cycle $W_5$ and Kontsevich's boundary. This provides combinatorial analogues of Mumford's relations on $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ and Penner's relations in the hyperbolic combinatorial model. The free homotopy classes of loops around $W_5$ are interpreted as pentagon moves while those of loops around Kontsevich's boundary as combinatorial Dehn twists. Throughout the paper we exploit the classical description of the combinatorial model in terms of Jenkins--Strebel differentials, parametrized in terms of {\it homological coordinates}; we also show that they provide Darboux coordinates for the symplectic structure introduced by Kontsevich. We also express the latter in clear geometric terms as the intersection pairing in the odd homology of the canonical double cover.",0
52041,2,"On the Spiral Structures in Heavy-Ion Collisions It is well established that many galaxies, like our Milky Way, exhibit spiral patterns. The entire galactic disc rotates about the galactic centre with different speeds; higher closer to the centre, lower at greater distances - that is, galactic discs do not rotate like a solid compact disc. The spiral arms are the part of the galactic disc where many young stars are being born. Since young stars are also brightest, we can see the spiral structure of other galaxies from afar. Typically spiral galaxies are copiously observed at redshifts z ~ 1. The recently observed grand-design galaxy Q2343-BX442 at z=2.18, however, implies uncertain origin of its spiral structure. Indeed such ""old"" galaxies usually look rather clumpy because of their dynamically hot discs.

Thus, spiral structures in galactic patterns may be traced back to a few microseconds after the Big Bang.",0

55299,2,"Laurent positivity of quantized canonical bases for quantum cluster varieties from surfaces In 2006, Fock and Goncharov constructed a nice basis of the ring of regular functions on the moduli space of framed ${\rm PGL}_2$-local systems on a punctured surface $S$. The moduli space is birational to a cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety, whose positive real points recover the enhanced Teichm\""uller space of $S$. Their basis is enumerated by integral laminations on $S$, which are collections of closed curves in $S$ with integer weights. Around ten years later, a quantum version of this basis, still enumerated by integral laminations, was constructed by Allegretti and Kim. For each choice of an ideal triangulation of $S$, each quantum basis element is a Laurent polynomial in the exponential of quantum shear coordinates for edges of the triangulation, with coefficients being Laurent polynomials in $q$ with integer coefficients. We show that these coefficients are Laurent polynomials in $q$ with positive integer coefficients. Our result has been conjectured in the physics literature, and may lead to other positivity results. A key step in our proof is to solve a purely topological and combinatorial ordering problem about an ideal triangulation and a closed curve on $S$. For this problem we introduce a certain graph on $S$, which is interesting in its own right.",0

We demonstrate how these solutions originate from degenerate energy solutions of the Schroedinger equation. Technically this is achieved by the application of Darboux-Crum transformations involving Jordan states with suitable regularizing shifts. Alternatively they may be constructed from a limiting process within the context Hirota's direct method or on a nonlinear superposition obtained from multiple Baecklund transformations. The proposed procedure is completely generic and also applicable to other types of nonlinear integrable systems.",0

57456,2,"Hydrodynamics of electrons in graphene Generic interacting many-body quantum systems are believed to behave as classical fluids on long time and length scales. Due to rapid progress in growing exceptionally pure crystals, we are now able to experimentally observe this collective motion of electrons in solid-state systems, including graphene. We present a review of recent progress in understanding the hydrodynamic limit of electronic motion in graphene, written for physicists from diverse communities. We begin by discussing the ""phase diagram"" of graphene, and the inevitable presence of impurities and phonons in experimental systems. We derive hydrodynamics, both from a phenomenological perspective and using kinetic theory. We then describe how hydrodynamic electron flow is visible in electronic transport measurements. Although we focus on graphene in this review, the broader framework naturally generalizes to other materials. We assume only basic knowledge of condensed matter physics, and no prior knowledge of hydrodynamics.",0

58046,2,"Revisiting Connes' Finite Spectral Distance on Non-commutative Spaces : Moyal Plane and Fuzzy Sphere We revise and extend the algorithm provided in [1] to compute the finite Connes' distance between normal states. The original formula in [1] contains an error and actually only provides a lower bound. The correct expression, which we provide here, involves the computation of the infimum of an expression which involves the ""transverse"" component of the algebra element in addition to the ""longitudinal"" component of [1]. This renders the formula less user-friendly, as the determination of the exact transverse component for which the infimum is reached remains a non-trivial task, but under rather generic conditions it turns out that the Connes' distance is proportional to the trace norm of the difference in the density matrices, leading to considerable simplification. In addition, we can determine an upper bound of the distance by emulating and adapting the approach of [2] in our Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation. We then look for an optimal element for which the upper bound is reached. We are able to find one for the Moyal plane through the limit of a sequence obtained by finite dimensional projections of the representative of an element belonging to a multiplier algebra, onto the subspaces of the total Hilbert space, occurring in the spectral triple and spanned by the eigen-spinors of the respective Dirac operator. This is in contrast with the fuzzy sphere, where the upper bound, which is given by the geodesic of a commutative sphere is never reached for any finite $n$-representation of $SU(2)$. Indeed, for the case of maximal non-commutativity ($n = 1/2$), the finite distance is shown to coincide exactly with the above mentioned lower bound, with the transverse component playing no role. This, however starts changing from $n=1$ onwards and we try to improve the estimate of the finite distance and provide an almost exact result, using our new and modified algorithm.",0
58439,2,"Error Correction of Quantum Reference Frame Information The existence of quantum error correcting codes is one of the most counterintuitive and potentially technologically important discoveries of quantum information theory. However, standard error correction refers to abstract quantum information, i.e., information that is independent of the physical incarnation of the systems used for storing the information. There are, however, other forms of information that are physical - one of the most ubiquitous being reference frame information. Here we analyze the problem of error correcting physical information. The basic question we seek to answer is whether or not such error correction is possible and, if so, what limitations govern the process. The main challenge is that the systems used for transmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them, must necessarily obey these limitations. Encoding and decoding operations that obey a restrictive set of limitations need not exist a priori. We focus on the case of erasure errors, and we first show that the problem is equivalent to quantum error correction using group-covariant encodings. We prove a no-go theorem showing that that no finite dimensional, group-covariant quantum codes exist for Lie groups with an infinitesimal generator (e.g., U(1), SU(2), and SO(3)). We then explain how one can circumvent this no-go theorem using infinite dimensional codes, and we give an explicit example of a covariant quantum error correcting code using continuous variables for the group U(1). Finally, we demonstrate that all finite groups have finite dimensional codes, giving both an explicit construction and a randomized approximate construction with exponentially better parameters.",0

61942,2,"There is more to quantum interferometry than entanglement Entanglement has long stood as one of the characteristic features of quantum mechanics, yet recent developments have emphasized the importance of quantumness beyond entanglement for quantum foundations and technologies. We demonstrate that entanglement cannot entirely capture the worst-case sensitivity in quantum interferometry when quantum probes are used to estimate the phase imprinted by a Hamiltonian, with fixed energy levels but variable eigenbasis, acting on one arm of an interferometer. This is shown by defining a bipartite entanglement monotone tailored to this interferometric setting and proving that it never exceeds the so-called interferometric power, a quantity which relies on more general quantum correlations beyond entanglement and captures the relevant resource. We then prove that the interferometric power can never increase when local commutativity-preserving operations are applied to qubit probes, an important step to validate such a quantity as a genuine quantum correlations monotone. These findings are accompanied by a room-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance experimental investigation, in which two-qubit states with extremal (maximal and minimal) interferometric power at fixed entanglement are produced and characterized.",0

We then prove the significantly more general theorem that if the Jacobiator takes values in the image of any linear map that defines an ideal there is a 3-term L$_{\infty}$ algebra with a generally non-trivial 4-bracket. We discuss special cases such as the commutator algebra of octonions, its contraction to the `R-flux algebra', and the Courant algebroid.",0

Astronomical observations have revealed a variety of extrasolar planets none of which resembles any of the solar system planets in full. Instead, the most massive amongst the extrasolar planets, the gas giants, appear very similar to the class of (young) Brown Dwarfs which are amongst the oldest objects in the universe. Despite of this diversity, solar system planets, extrasolar planets and Brown Dwarfs have broadly similar global temperatures between 300K and 2500K. In consequence, clouds of different chemical species form in their atmospheres. While the details of these clouds differ, the fundamental physical processes are the same. Further to this, all these objects were observed to produce radio and X-ray emission. While both kinds of radiation are well studied on Earth and to a lesser extent on the solar system planets, the occurrence of emission that potentially originate from accelerated electrons on Brown Dwarfs, extrasolar planets and protoplanetary disks is not well understood yet.

63092,2,"Path integral representation for the Hubbard model with reduced number of Lefschetz thimbles The concept of Lefschetz thimble decomposition is one of the most promising possible modifications of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms aimed at alleviating the sign problem which appears in many interesting physical situations, e.g. in the Hubbard model away from half filling. In this approach one utilizes the fact that the integral over real variables with an integrand containing a complex fluctuating phase is equivalent to the sum of integrals over special manifolds in complex space (""Lefschetz thimbles""), each of them having a fixed complex phase factor. Thus, the sign problem can be reduced if the resulting sum contains terms with only a few different phases. We explore the complexity of the sign problem for the few-site Hubbard model on square lattice combining a semi-analytical study of saddle points and thimbles in small lattices with several steps in Euclidean time with results of test QMC calculations. We check different variants of conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation based on Gaussian integrals. On the basis of our analysis we reveal a regime with minimal number of relevant thimbles in the vicinity of half filling. In this regime we found only two relevant thimbles for the few-site lattices studied in the paper. There is also indirect evidence of the existence of this regime in more realistic systems with large number of Euclidean time slices. In addition, we derive a new non-Gaussian representation of the interaction term, where the number of relevant Lefschetz is also reduced in comparison with conventional Gaussian Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.",0

This is in line with an instability of the VHS toward the formation of ordered electronic phases, which has been predicted by a variety of different theoretical approaches.",0
69766,2,"Boundary Conditions and Formation of Pure Spin Currents in Magnetic Field Schr\""odinger equation for an electron confined to a two-dimensional strip is considered in the presence of homogeneous orthogonal magnetic field.

In the case of spinless electrons the Dirichlet and Neumann BC are considered. The Dirichlet BC result in the existence of charge carrying edge states. For the Neumann BC each separate edge comprises two counterflow sub-currents which precisely cancel out each other provided the system is populated by electrons up to certain Fermi level. Cancelation of electric current is a good starting point for developing the spin-effects. In this scope we reconsider the problem for a spinning electron with Rashba coupling.

71650,2,"Density response and collective modes of semiholographic non-Fermi liquids Semiholographic models of non-Fermi liquids have been shown to have generically stable generalized quasiparticles on the Fermi surface. Although these excitations are broad and exhibit particle-hole asymmetry, they were argued to be stable from interactions at the Fermi surface. In this work, we use this observation to compute the density response and collective behaviour in these systems. Compared to the Fermi liquid case, we find that the boundaries of the particle-hole continuum are blurred by incoherent contributions. However, there is a region inside this continuum, that we call inner core, within which salient features of the Fermi liquid case are preserved. A particularly striking prediction of our work is that these systems support a plasmonic collective excitation which is well-defined at large momenta, has an approximately linear dispersion relation and is located in the low-energy tail of the particle-hole continuum. Furthermore, the dynamic screening potential shows deep attractive regions as a function of the distance at higher frequencies which might lead to long-lived pair formation depending on the behavior of the pair susceptibility.

72923,2,"Optimized quantum f-divergences and data processing The quantum relative entropy is a measure of the distinguishability of two quantum states, and it is a unifying concept in quantum information theory: many information measures such as entropy, conditional entropy, mutual information, and entanglement measures can be realized from it. As such, there has been broad interest in generalizing the notion to further understand its most basic properties, one of which is the data processing inequality. The quantum f-divergence of Petz is one generalization of the quantum relative entropy, and it also leads to other relative entropies, such as the Petz-Renyi relative entropies. In this paper, I introduce the optimized quantum f-divergence as a related generalization of quantum relative entropy. I prove that it satisfies the data processing inequality, and the method of proof relies upon the operator Jensen inequality, similar to Petz's original approach. Interestingly, the sandwiched Renyi relative entropies are particular examples of the optimized f-divergence. Thus, one benefit of this paper is that there is now a single, unified approach for establishing the data processing inequality for both the Petz-Renyi and sandwiched Renyi relative entropies, for the full range of parameters for which it is known to hold. This paper discusses other aspects of the optimized f-divergence, such as the classical case, the classical-quantum case, and how to construct optimized f-information measures.",0
74314,2,"Associative algebras for (logarithmic) twisted modules for a vertex operator algebra We construct two associative algebras from a vertex operator algebra $V$ and a general automorphism $g$ of $V$.

These algebras are generalizations of the corresponding algebras introduced and studied by Frenkel-Zhu and Nagatomo-Tsuchiya in the (untwisted) case that $g$ is the identity. The other is a generalization of the $g$-twisted version of Zhu's algebra for suitable $g$-twisted modules constructed by Dong-Li-Mason when the order of $g$ is finite. We are mainly interested in $g$-twisted $V$-modules introduced by the first author in the case that $g$ is of infinite order and does not act on $V$ semisimply. In this case, twisted vertex operators in general involve the logarithm of the variable. We construct functors between categories of suitable modules for these associative algebras and categories of suitable (logarithmic) $g$-twisted $V$-modules.

In this paper, we have studied the anholonomy for noncontractible loops — closed paths in a curved surface that do not enclose any area and hence Stokes theorem is not directly applicable. Examples of such closed paths are poloidal and toroidal loops and knots on a torus. The present study is distinct from conventional results on anholonomy for closed paths on S2 since in the latter case all closed paths are contractible or trivial cycles. We find that for some nontrivial cycles the anholonomy cancels out over the complete cycle. Next, we calculate Hannay angle for a particle traversing such noncontractible loops when the torus itself is revolving. Some new and interesting results are obtained especially for poloidal paths that is for paths that encircle the torus ring.",0
75639,2,"Topological order and Fermi surface reconstruction This review describes how topological order can reconstruct Fermi surfaces of metals, even in the absence of translational symmetry breaking. We begin with an introduction to topological order using Wegner's quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory on the square lattice: the topological state is characterized by the expulsion of defects, carrying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ magnetic flux. The interplay between topological order and the breaking of global symmetry is described by the non-zero temperature statistical mechanics of classical XY models in dimension $D=3$; such models also describe the zero temperature quantum phases of bosons with short-range interactions on the square lattice at integer filling. The topological state is again characterized by the expulsion of certain defects, in a state with fluctuating symmetry-breaking order. The phase diagrams of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory and the XY models are obtained by embedding them in U(1) gauge theories, and by studying their Higgs and confining phases. These ideas are then applied to the single-band Hubbard model on the square lattice. A SU(2) gauge theory describes the fluctuations of spin-density-wave order, and its phase diagram is presented by analogy to the XY models. We obtain a class of zero temperature metallic states with fluctuating spin-density wave order, topological order associated with defect expulsion, reconstructed Fermi surfaces (with `chargon' or electron-like quasiparticles), but no broken symmetry. We conclude with the application of such metallic states to the pseudogap phase of the cuprates, and note the recent comparison with numerical studies of the Hubbard model. In a detour, we also discuss the influence of Berry phases, and how they can lead to deconfined quantum critical points: this applies to bosons on the square lattice at half-integer filling, and to quantum dimer models.",0

77320,2,"The phase-diagram of the Blume-Capel-Haldane-Ising spin chain We consider the one-dimensional spin chain for arbitrary spin $s$ on a periodic chain with $N$ sites, the generalization of the chain that was studied by Blume and Capel \cite{bc}: $$H=\sum_{i=1}^N \left(a (S^z_i)^2+ b S^z_iS^z_{i+1}\right).$$ The Hamiltonian only involves the $z$ component of the spin thus it is essentially an Ising \cite{Ising} model. The Hamiltonian also figures exactly as the anisotropic term in the famous model studied by Haldane \cite{haldane} of the large spin Heisenberg spin chain \cite{bethe}. Therefore we call the model the Blume-Capel-Haldane-Ising model. Although the Hamiltonian is trivially diagonal, it is actually not always obvious which eigenstate is the ground state. In this paper we establish which state is the ground state for all regions of the parameter space and thus determine the phase diagram of the model. We observe the existence of solitons-like excitations and we show that the size of the solitons depends only on the ratio $a/b$ and not on the number of sites $N$. Therefore the size of the soliton is an intrinsic property of the soliton not determined by boundary conditions.",0

79800,2,"Time-delay and reality conditions for complex solitons We compute lateral displacements and time-delays for a scattering processes of complex multi-soliton solutions of the Korteweg de-Vries equation.The resulting expressions are employed to explain the precise distinction between solutions obtained from different techniques, Hirota's direct method and a superposition principle based on Baecklund transformations. Moreover they explain the internal structures of degenerate compound multi-solitons previously constructed. Their individual one-soliton constituents are time-delayed when scattered amongst each other. We present generic formulae for these time-dependent displacements. By recalling Gardner's transformation method for conserved charges, we argue that the structure of the asymptotic behaviour resulting from the integrability of the model together with its PT-symmetry ensure the reality of all of these charges, including in particular the mass, the momentum and the energy.",0

81033,2,"Rewiring Stabilizer Codes We present an algorithm for manipulating quantum information via a sequence of projective measurements. We frame this manipulation in the language of stabilizer codes: a quantum computation approach in which errors are prevented and corrected in part by repeatedly measuring redundant degrees of freedom. We show how to construct a set of projective measurements which will map between two arbitrary stabilizer codes. We show that this process preserves all quantum information. It can be used to implement Clifford gates, braid extrinsic defects, or move between codes in which different operations are natural.",0
81298,2,"EnVision: understanding why our most Earth-like neighbour is so different This document is the EnVision Venus orbiter proposal, submitted in October 2016 in response to ESA's M5 call for Medium-size missions for its Science Programme, for launch in 2029. Why are the terrestrial planets so different? Venus should be the most Earth-like of all our planetary neighbours: its size, bulk composition and distance from the Sun are very similar to those of Earth. Its original atmosphere was probably similar to that of early Earth, with abundant water that would have been liquid under the young sun's fainter output. Even today, with its global cloud cover, the surface of Venus receives less solar energy than does Earth, so why did a moderate climate ensue here but a catastrophic runaway greenhouse on Venus? How and why did it all go wrong for Venus? What lessons can be learned about the life story of terrestrial planets in general, in this era of discovery of Earth-like exoplanets? Were the radically different evolutionary paths of Earth and Venus driven solely by distance from the Sun, or do internal dynamics, geological activity, volcanic outgassing and weathering also play an important part? Following the primarily atmospheric focus of Venus Express, we propose a new Venus orbiter named EnVision, to focus on Venus' geology and geochemical cycles, seeking evidence for present and past activity. The payload comprises a state-of-the-art S-band radar which will be able to return imagery at spatial resolutions of 1 - 30 m, and capable of measuring cm-scale deformation; this is complemented by subsurface radar, IR and UV spectrometers to map volcanic gases, and by geodetic investigations.",0

We present a new suite of simulation-based inference techniques that go beyond the traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approach, which struggles in a high-dimensional setting, and extend methods that use surrogate models based on neural networks. We show that additional information, such as the joint likelihood ratio and the joint score, can often be extracted from simulators and used to augment the training data for these surrogate models.

On the other hand, it is known that the total descendant potential of a singularity of type $D$ is a tau-function of the principal Kac--Wakimoto hierarchy. We find explicitly the point in the Grassmanian of the 2-component BKP hierarchy (in the sense of Shiota) that corresponds to the total descendant potential.

82141,2,"Riemann Hypothesis and Random Walks: the Zeta case In previous work it was shown that if certain series based on sums over primes of non-principal Dirichlet characters have a conjectured random walk behavior, then the Euler product formula for its $L$-function is valid to the right of the critical line $\Re (s) > \tfrac{1}{2}$, and the Riemann Hypothesis for this class of $L$-functions follows. Building on this work, here we propose how to extend this line of reasoning to the Riemann zeta function and other principal Dirichlet $L$-functions. We apply these results to the study of the argument of the zeta function. In another application, we define and study a 1-point correlation function of the Riemann zeros, which leads to the construction of a probabilistic model for them. Based on these results we describe a new algorithm for computing very high Riemann zeros, and we calculate the googol-th zero, namely $10^{100}$-th zero to over 100 digits, far beyond what is currently known.",0
83403,2,"Operator Dynamics in Brownian Quantum Circuit We explore the operator dynamics in a random $N$-spin model with pairwise interactions (Brownian quanum circuit). We introduce the height $h$ of an operator to characterize its spatial extent, and derive the master equation of the height probability distribution. The study of an initial simple operator with $h = 1$ (minimal nonzero height) shows that the mean height, which is proportional to the squared commutator, has an initial exponential growth. It then slows down around the scrambling time $\sim\log N$ and finally saturates to a steady state in a manner similar to the logistic function. The deviation to the logistic function is due to the large fluctuations (order $N$) in the intermediate time. Moreover, we find that the exponential growth rate (quantum Lyapunov exponent) is smaller for initial operator with $\langle h\rangle\gg 1$. Based on this observation, we propose that the chaos bound at finite temperature can be produced by an initial operator whose height distribution is biased towards higher operators. We numerically test the power law initial height distribution $1/h^{\alpha} $ in a Brownian circuit with number of spin $N=10000$ and show that the Lyapunov exponent is linearly constrained by $\alpha$ before reaching the infinite temperature value.",0

For SL($n$, $\mathbb{Q}_p$) we define an algorithm for computing a complete Iwasawa-decomposition and give a formula parameterizing the full family of decompositions. Furthermore, we prove that the $p$-adic norms of the coordinates on the Cartan torus are unique across all decompositions and give a closed formula for them which is proven using induction. For the case SL($n$, $\mathbb{R}$), the decomposition is unique and we give formulae for the complete decomposition which are also proven inductively.

This yields a simple formula valid globally which expresses these norms in terms of the vector norms of generalized Pl\""ucker coordinates.",0

Here we report on a selection of interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of hydrogen-helium mixtures. We demonstrate that a dilute core, expanded to a significant fraction of the planet's radius, is helpful in reconciling the calculated $J_n$ with Juno's observations. Although model predictions are strongly affected by the chosen equation of state, the prediction of an enrichment of $Z$ in the deep, metallic envelope over that in the shallow, molecular envelope holds. We estimate Jupiter's core to contain an 7--25 Earth mass of heavy elements. We discuss the current difficulties in reconciling measured $J_n$ with the equations of state, and with theory for formation and evolution of the planet.",0

86286,2,"Solar models in light of new high metallicity measurements from solar wind data We study the impact of new metallicity measurements, from solar wind data, on the solar model. The ""solar modelling problem"" refers to the persisting discrepancy between helioseismological observations and predictions of solar models computed implementing state-of-the-art photospheric abundances. We critically reassess the problem, in particular considering the new set of abundances of von Steiger \& Zurbuchen 2016, determined through the \textit{in situ} collection of solar wind samples from polar coronal holes. This new set of abundances indicates a solar metallicity $Z_{\odot} \geq 0.0196 \pm 0.0014$, significantly higher than the currently established value. The new values hint at an abundance of volatile elements (i.e. C, N, O, Ne) close to previous results of Grevesse \& Sauval 1998, whereas the abundance of refractory elements (i.e. Mg, Si, S, Fe) is considerably increased. Using the Linear Solar Model formalism, we determine the variation of helioseismological observables in response to the changes in elemental abundances, in order to explore the consistency of these new measurements with constraints from helioseismology. We find that, for observables that are particularly sensitive to the abundance of volatile elements, in particular the radius of the convective zone boundary (CZB) and the sound speed around the radius of CZB, improved agreement over previous models is obtained. Conversely, the high abundance of refractories correlates with a higher core temperature, resulting in an overproduction of neutrinos and a huge increase in the surface Helium abundance. We conclude that the ""solar modelling problem"" remains unsolved.",0

86902,2,"Why is the HLR theory particle-hole symmetric? Long wavelength descriptions of a half-filled lowest Landau level ($\nu = 1/2$) must be consistent with the experimental observation of particle-hole (PH) symmetry. The traditional description of the $\nu=1/2$ state pioneered by Halperin, Lee and Read (HLR) naively appears to break PH symmetry. However, recent studies have shown that the HLR theory with weak quenched disorder can exhibit an emergent PH symmetry. We find that such inhomogeneous configurations of the $\nu=1/2$ fluid, when described by HLR mean-field theory, are tuned to a topological phase transition between an integer quantum Hall state and an insulator of composite fermions. Our observations help explain why the HLR theory exhibits PH symmetric dc response.",0
87237,2,"Formation of Bose-Einstein condensates The problem of understanding how a coherent, macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) emerges from the cooling of a thermal Bose gas has attracted significant theoretical and experimental interest over several decades. The pioneering achievement of BEC in weakly-interacting dilute atomic gases in 1995 was followed by a number of experimental studies examining the growth of the BEC number, as well as the development of its coherence. More recently there has been interest in connecting such experiments to universal aspects of nonequilibrium phase transitions, in terms of both static and dynamical critical exponents. Here, the spontaneous formation of topological structures such as vortices and solitons in quenched cold-atom experiments has enabled the verification of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicting the density of topological defects in continuous phase transitions, first proposed in the context of the evolution of the early universe. This chapter reviews progress in the understanding of BEC formation, and discusses open questions and future research directions in the dynamics of phase transitions in quantum gases.",0
87573,2,"Generalized theory of diffusion based on kinetic theory We propose to use spin hydrodynamics, a two-fluid model of spin propagation, as a generalization of the diffusion equation. We show that in the dense limit spin hydrodynamics reduces to Fick's law and the diffusion equation. In the opposite limit spin hydrodynamics is equivalent to a collisionless Boltzmann treatment of spin propagation. Spin hydrodynamics avoids unphysical effects that arise when the diffusion equation is used to describe to a strongly interacting gas with a dilute corona. We apply spin hydrodynamics to the problem of spin diffusion in a trapped atomic gas. We find that the observed spin relaxation rate in the high-temperature limit [Sommer , Nature (London) 472, 201 (2011)NATUAS0028-083610.1038/nature09989] is consistent with the diffusion constant predicted by kinetic theory.",0
87721,2,"Nature of pairing correlations in the homogeneous Fermi gas at unitarity In the two-component Fermi gas with contact interactions a pseudogap regime, in which pairing correlations are present without superfluidity, can exist at temperatures between the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$ and a temperature $T^* > T_c$. However, the existence of a pseudogap in the unitary limit of infinite scattering length is debated. To help address this issue, we have used finite-temperature auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods to study the thermodynamics of the spin-balanced homogeneous unitary Fermi gas on a lattice. We present results for the thermal energy, heat capacity, condensate fraction, a model-independent pairing gap, and spin susceptibility, and compare them to experimental data when available. Our model space consists of the complete first Brillouin zone of the lattice, and our calculations are performed in the canonical ensemble of fixed particle number. We find that the energy-staggering pairing gap vanishes above $T_c$ and that $T^*$ at unitarity, as determined from the spin susceptibility, is lower than previously reported in AFMC simulations.",0

89166,2,"Insight into bulk niobium superconducting RF cavities performances by tunneling spectroscopy Point contact tunneling (PCT) spectroscopy measurements are reported over wide areas of cm-sized cut outs from niobium superconducting RF cavities. A comparison is made between a high-quality, conventionally processed (CP) cavity with a high field Q drop for acceleration field E $>$ 20 MV/m and a nitrogen doped (N-doped) cavity that exhibits an increasing Q up to fields approaching 15 MV/m. The CP cavity displays hot spot regions at high RF fields where Q-drop occurs as well as unaffected regions (cold spots). PCT data on cold spots reveals a near ideal BCS density of states (DOS) with gap parameters, $\Delta$ as high as 1.62 meV, that are among the highest values ever reported for Nb. Hot spot regions exhibit a wide distribution of gap values down to $\Delta \sim$ 1.0 meV and DOS broadening characterized by a relatively large value of pair-breaking rate, $\Gamma$, indicating surface regions of significantly reduced superconductivity. In addition, hot spots commonly exhibit Kondo tunneling peaks indicative of surface magnetic moments attributed to a defective oxide. N-doped cavities reveal a more homoegeneous gap distribution centered at $\Delta \sim$ 1.5 meV and relatively small values of $\Gamma/\Delta$. The absence of regions of significantly reduced superconductivity indicates that the N interstitials are playing an important role in preventing the formation of hydride phases and other macroscopic defects which might otherwise severely affect the local, surface superconductivity that lead to hot spot formation. The N-doped cavities also display a significantly improved surface oxide, i.e., increased thickness and tunnel barrier height, compared to CP cavities. These results help explain the improved performance of N-doped cavities and give insights into the origin of the initial increasing Q with RF amplitude.",0

The bound does not depend on the size or mass of the emitting and receiving systems, nor on the nature of the signal. No restrictions on preparing and processing the signal are imposed. As an example, I consider the encoding of information in the transverse or angular position of a signal emitted and received by systems of arbitrarily large cross section.

89740,2,"A comparative study of $2d$ Ising model at different boundary conditions using Cellular Automata Using Cellular Automata, we simulate spin systems corresponding to $2d$ Ising model with various kinds of boundary conditions (bcs).

In the context of $2d$ Ising model, we have calculated the magnetisation, energy, specific heat, susceptibility and entropy with each of the bcs and observed that the phase transition occurs around $T_c$ = 2.269 as obtained by Onsager. We compare the behaviour of magnetisation vs temperature for different types of bcs by calculating the number of points close to the line of zero magnetisation after $T>T_c$ at various lattice sizes. We observe that the periodic, adiabatic and reflexive bcs give closer approximation to the value of $T_c$ than fixed +1 and fixed -1 bcs with all three initial conditions for lattice size less than $70\times70$.

Throughout, we will be guided by the goal to clarify and address the question: when does a given thickening embed in a supermanifold? Such a question was, in principle, first studied by Eastwood and LeBrun. In this article we begin with a pedagogical account of their study, after which we further study thickenings in supergeometry and present a classification of thickenings of a given order.

98001,2,"Thermodynamic versus kinetic approach to polarization-vorticity coupling We critically compare thermodynamic and kinetic approaches, that have been recently used to study relations between the spin polarization and fluid vorticity in systems consisting of spin-one-half particles. The thermodynamic approach refers to general properties of global thermal equilibrium with a rigid-like rotation and demonstrates that the spin-polarization and thermal-vorticity tensors are equal. On the other hand, the kinetic approach uses the concept of the Wigner function and its semiclassical expansion. In most of the works done so far, the Wigner functions satisfy kinetic equations with a vanishing collision term. We show that this assumption restricts significantly applicability of such frameworks and, in contrast to many claims found in the literature, does not allow for drawing any conclusions regarding the relation between the thermal-vorticity and spin-polarization tensors, except for the fact that the two should be constant in global equilibrium. We further show how the kinetic-theory equations including spin degrees of freedom can be used to formulate a hydrodynamic framework for particles with spin.",0

At some critical value of the chemical potential of 3-cycles, $\mu$, the network decays into the maximally possible number of almost full subgraphs, and the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix acquires the two-zonal structure with a large gap. We find that the Laplacian eigenvalue statistics corresponds to delocalized states in one zone, and to the localized states in the second one. We interpret this behavior in terms of the many-body localization problem where the structure of the Fock space of some interacting many-body system is approximated by the RGG and/or by the CERN. We associate 3-cycles in RRGs and CERNs as resonant triples in the Fock space. We show that the scenario of the ""localization without disorder"", discussed previously in physical space, can be realized in the Fock space as well. We argue that it is natural to identify clusters in a RRG with particles in a many-body system above the phase transition. We discuss the controversial issue of an additional phase transition between ergodic and non-ergodic regimes in the delocalized phase in the Fock space and find a strong ""memory dependence"" of the states in the delocalized phase, thus advocating existence of non-ergodic delocalized states.",0

Through explicit calculations, we find two features of superconductivity arising from an IM normal state: First, despite the absence of quasiparticles in the normal state, the superconducting state still exhibits coherent superfluid transport. Second, the non-quasiparticle nature of the IM Green's functions produces a large enhancement in the gap ratio $2\Delta/T_c$ with respect to its BCS value of $3.53$.",0
99780,2,Memory Effect in Upper Bound of Heat Flux Induced by Quantum Fluctuations Thermodynamic behaviors in a quantum Brownian motion coupled to a classical heat bath is studied. We then define a heat operator by generalizing the stochastic energetics and show the energy balance (first law) and the upper bound of the expectation value of the heat operator (second law). We further find that this upper bound depends on the memory effect induced by quantum fluctuations and hence the maximum extractable work can be qualitatively modified in quantum thermodynamics.,0
99831,2,"Quantized Laplacian growth, I: Statistical theory of Laplacian growth We regularize the Laplacian growth problem with zero surface tension by introducing a short-distance cutoff $\hbar$, so that the change of the area of domains is quantized and equals an integer multiple of the area quanta $\hbar$. The domain can be then considered as an aggregate of tiny particles (area quanta) obeying the Pauli exclusion principle. The statistical theory of Laplacian growth is introduced by using Laughlin's description of the integer quantum Hall effect. The semiclassical evolution of the aggregate is similar to classical deterministic Laplacian growth. However, the quantization procedure generates inevitable fluctuations at the edge of the droplet. The statistical properties of the edge fluctuations are universal and common to that of quantum chaotic systems, which are generally described by Dyson's circular ensembles on symmetric unitary matrices.",0
99896,2,"Accelerating HPC codes on Intel(R) Omni-Path Architecture networks: From particle physics to Machine Learning We discuss practical methods to ensure near wirespeed performance from clusters with either one or two Intel(R) Omni-Path host fabric interfaces (HFI) per node, and Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) 72xx (Knight's Landing) processors, and using the Linux operating system. The study evaluates the performance improvements achievable and the required programming approaches in two distinct example problems: firstly in Cartesian communicator halo exchange problems, appropriate for structured grid PDE solvers that arise in quantum chromodynamics simulations of particle physics, and secondly in gradient reduction appropriate to synchronous stochastic gradient descent for machine learning. As an example, we accelerate a published Baidu Research reduction code and obtain a factor of ten speedup over the original code using the techniques discussed in this paper. This displays how a factor of ten speedup in strongly scaled distributed machine learning could be achieved when synchronous stochastic gradient descent is massively parallelised with a fixed mini-batch size. We find a significant improvement in performance robustness when memory is obtained using carefully allocated 2MB ""huge"" virtual memory pages, implying that either non-standard allocation routines should be used for communication buffers. These can be accessed via a LD\_PRELOAD override in the manner suggested by libhugetlbfs. We make use of a the Intel(R) MPI 2019 library ""Technology Preview"" and underlying software to enable thread concurrency throughout the communication software stake via multiple PSM2 endpoints per process and use of multiple independent MPI communicators. When using a single MPI process per node, we find that this greatly accelerates delivered bandwidth in many core Intel(R) Xeon Phi processors.",0

When phases of both components are decoupled, half-quantized vortex-antivortex pairs of each component induce two-step BKT transitions. On the other hand, when phases of the both components are synchronized through the inter-component Josephson coupling, two species of vortices of each component are bind to form a molecule, and in this case, we find that there is only one BKT transition by molecule-antimolecule pairs.

Some QWs admit a continuum limit, leading to well-known physics partial differential equations, such as the Dirac equation. We show that these simulation results need not rely on the grid: the Dirac equation in $(2+1)$--dimensions can also be simulated, through local unitaries, on the honeycomb or the triangular lattice. The former is of interest in the study of graphene-like materials. The latter, we argue, opens the door for a generalization of the Dirac equation to arbitrary discrete surfaces.",0

We present straightening relations to the canonical basis, and using Laplace transforms we obtain functional representations for each quotient space.",0
102417,2,"Turbulence characteristics of wave-blocking phenomena This study explores experimentally the turbulent flow in a laboratory flume, interacting with waves propagated against the flow. It focuses a region of wave-blocking for which there is a streamwise location on the water surface, where the wave propagation velocity vanishes. The observations are corroborated by finding a critical wave frequency for a particular discharge above which the waves are effectively blocked; and verified by the dispersion relation of monochromatic wave. The counter-current propagating waves show an evolutionary change in the flow with three segmented regions, viz, flow at the upstream, blocking at the mid-stream and waves in the downstream. The instantaneous velocity data were collected using 3D Micro-acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) along the flume centerline. This study addresses the changes in the mean flows, Reynolds stresses, eddy viscosity, turbulence kinetic energy fluxes and associated contributions of burst-sweep cycles to the total Reynolds shear stress due to addition of surface waves against a current. The velocity power spectral analysis shows the energy distribution over the whole profile from upstream to downstream. The quadrant analysis is also used to highlight the turbulent event evolutions along the flow; and shows that at the waveblocking and wave dominated regions, the contributions from ejection and sweep to the total shear stress are dominant. The changes in turbulence key parameters due to waveblocking may affect the sediment transport in coastal region",0
102916,2,"Quantum Fluctuations in Mesoscopic Systems Recent experimental results point to the existence of coherent quantum phenomena in systems made of a large number of particles, despite the fact that for many-body systems the presence of decoherence is hardly negligible and emerging classicality is expected. This behaviour hinges on collective observables, named quantum fluctuations, that retain a quantum character even in the thermodynamic limit: they provide useful tools for studying properties of many-body systems at the mesoscopic level, in-between the quantum microscopic scale and the classical macroscopic one. We herein present the general theory of quantum fluctuations in mesoscopic systems, and study their dynamics in a quantum open system setting, taking into account the unavoidable effects of dissipation and noise induced by the external environment. As in the case of microscopic systems, decoherence is not always the only dominating effect at the mesoscopic scale: certain types of environment can provide means for entangling collective fluctuations through a purely noisy mechanism.",0

The form of this equation strongly hints towards a quantum generalization. Thus, we introduce a notion of quantum relative dimension and subject it to the appropriate consistency tests. This new quantity finds its natural environment in the context of RCFTs and fractional statistics; where the already established notion of quantum dimension has proven to be of great physical importance.",0

However, we obtain 1427 solutions that satisfy these constraints (to the order that we checked) and are unable to provide a unique Jacobi form. Nevertheless, as a consequence, we are able to provide a group theoretic proof of the evenness of the coefficients of all EOT Jacobi forms associated with conjugacy classes of $M_{12}:2 \subset M_{24}$. In the absence of a unique answer for $M_{12}$, we show that there exist moonshines for two distinct $L_2(11)$ sub-groups of the $M_{12}$.

106172,2,"Gauge Topological Nature of the Superconductor-Insulator Transition It has long been believed that, at absolute zero, electrons can form only one quantum coherent state, a superconductor. Yet, several two dimensional superconducting systems were found to harbor the superinsulating state with infinite resistance, a mirror image of superconductivity, and a metallic state often referred to as Bose metal, characterized by finite longitudinal and vanishing Hall resistances. The nature of these novel and mysterious quantum coherent states is the subject of intense study.Here, we propose a topological gauge description of the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) that enables us to identify the underlying mechanism of superinsulation as Polyakov's linear confinement of Cooper pairs via instantons. We find a criterion defining conditions for either a direct SIT or for the SIT via the intermediate Bose metal and demonstrate that this Bose metal phase is a Mott topological insulator in which the Cooper pair-vortex liquid is frozen by Aharonov-Bohm interactions.",0

While resembling the pairwise long-range form of the Haldane-Shastry model our formula accounts for the multi-spin interactions obtained by Uglov. Our expression is physically meaningful, makes hermiticity manifest, and is computationally more efficient. We discuss the model's properties, including its limits and (ordinary and quantum-affine) symmetries, and review the model's exact spectrum found by Uglov for finite spin-chain length, which parallels the isotropic case up to level splitting due to the anisotropy. We also extend the partially isotropic model to higher rank, with $SU(n)$ 'spins', for which the spectrum is determined by $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-motifs.",0

106823,2,Quasi-long-range order in trapped two-dimensional Bose gases We study the fate of algebraic decay of correlations in a harmonically trapped two-dimensional degenerate Bose gas. The analysis is inspired by recent experiments on ultracold atoms where power-law correlations have been observed despite the presence of the external potential. We generalize the spin wave description of phase fluctuations to the trapped case and obtain an analytical expression for the one-body density matrix within this approximation. We show that algebraic decay of the central correlation function persists to lengths of about 20% of the Thomas-Fermi radius. We establish that the trap-averaged correlation function decays algebraically with a strictly larger exponent weakly changing with trap size and find indications that the recently observed enhanced scaling exponents receive significant contributions from the normal component of the gas. We discuss radial and angular correlations and propose a local correlation approximation which captures the correlations very well. Our analysis goes beyond the usual local density approximation and the developed summation techniques constitute a powerful tool to investigate correlations in inhomogeneous systems.,0

In the case of $A_n$ evaluating the family at a special point we recover a branch of the Saito Frobenius structure of the $A_n$ singularity $y^2 = x^{n+1}$.

As opposed to conventional localized surface plasmon resonances, we show that in principle any plasmonic mode of arbitrarily high order is accessible by PPR with a spatially uniform optical pump. Moreover, in contradistinction with other mechanisms of plasmonic amplification, the coherent nature of PPR lends itself to a more straightforward experimental detection approach. The threshold conditions for PPR are analytically derived. Schemes of experimental realization and detection are also discussed.",0

The emergent gapless (diffusion) modes determine the behavior of the conductivity on large scales. We find a finite conductivity with an intermediate logarithmic finite-size scaling towards smaller conductivities but do not obtain the logarithmically divergence of the weak-localization approach.

110663,2,"Fusion and braiding in finite and affine Temperley-Lieb categories Finite Temperley-Lieb (TL) algebras are diagram-algebra quotients of (the group algebra of) the famous Artin's braid group $B_N$, while the affine TL algebras arise as diagram algebras from a generalized version of the braid group. We study asymptotic `$N\to\infty$' representation theory of these quotients (parametrized by $q\in\mathbb{C}^{\times}$) from a perspective of braided monoidal categories. Using certain idempotent subalgebras in the finite and affine algebras, we construct infinite `arc' towers of the diagram algebras and the corresponding direct system of representation categories, with terms labeled by $N\in\mathbb{N}$. The corresponding direct-limit category is our main object of studies. For the case of the finite TL algebras, we prove that the direct-limit category is abelian and highest-weight at any $q$ and endowed with braided monoidal structure. The most interesting result is when $q$ is a root of unity where the representation theory is non-semisimple. The resulting braided monoidal categories we obtain at different roots of unity are new and interestingly they are not rigid. We observe then a fundamental relation of these categories to a certain representation category of the Virasoro algebra and give a conjecture on the existence of a braided monoidal equivalence between the categories. This should have powerful applications to the study of the `continuum' limit of critical statistical mechanics systems based on the TL algebra. We also introduce a novel class of embeddings for the affine Temperley-Lieb algebras and related new concept of fusion or bilinear $\mathbb{N}$-graded tensor product of modules for these algebras. We prove that the fusion rules are stable with the index $N$ of the tower and prove that the corresponding direct-limit category is endowed with an associative tensor product.

We use Svetlichny's criterion for genuine multipartite nonlocality and nonlocal games to derive the complementarity relations under no-signaling constraints. We find that the complementarity relations are tightened for the much stricter quantum constraints. We compare this notion with the well-known notion of monogamy of nonlocality.

Besides the well-known effects of the magnetorotational instability (MRI), the Parker-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (PRTI) also arises as an important mechanism to help in the formation of the coronal region around an accretion disk and in the production of magnetic reconnection events similar to those occurring in the solar corona. In this work, we have performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (3D-MHD) shearing-box numerical simulations of accretion disks with an initial stratified density distribution and a strong azimuthal magnetic field with a ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressures of the order of unity. This study aimed at verifying the role of these instabilities on the formation of the coronal region and especially on the driving of turbulence and magnetic reconnection. Our simulations revealed an initial formation of large-scale magnetic loops due to the PRTI followed by the development of a nearly steady-state turbulence driven by both instabilities. We have employed an algorithm to identify the presence of current sheets produced by the encounter of magnetic flux ropes of opposite polarity in the turbulent regions of both the corona and the disk. We computed the magnetic reconnection rates in these locations obtaining average reconnection velocities in Alfv\'en speed units of the order of $0.13 \pm 0.9$ in the accretion disk and $0.17 \pm 0.10 $ in the coronal region (with mean peak values of order of $0.2$), which are consistent with the predictions of the theory of turbulence-induced fast reconnection.",0

115120,2,"Limits on the storage of quantum information in a volume of space We study the fundamental limits on the reliable storage of quantum information in lattices of qubits by deriving tradeoff bounds for approximate quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a notion of local approximate correctability and code distance, and give a number of equivalent formulations thereof, generalizing various exact error-correction criteria. Our tradeoff bounds relate the number of physical qubits $n$, the number of encoded qubits $k$, the code distance $d$, the accuracy parameter $\delta$ that quantifies how well the erasure channel can be reversed, and the locality parameter $\ell$ that specifies the length scale at which the recovery operation can be done. In a regime where the recovery is successful to accuracy $\epsilon$ that is exponentially small in $\ell$, which is the case for perturbations of local commuting projector codes, our bound reads $kd^{\frac{2}{D-1}} \le O\bigl(n (\log n)^{\frac{2D}{D-1}} \bigr)$ for codes on $D$-dimensional lattices of Euclidean metric. We also find that the code distance of any local approximate code cannot exceed $O\bigl(\ell n^{(D-1)/D}\bigr)$ if $\delta \le O(\ell n^{-1/D})$. As a corollary of our formulation of correctability in terms of logical operator avoidance, we show that the code distance $d$ and the size $\tilde d$ of a minimal region that can support all approximate logical operators satisfies $\tilde d d^{\frac{1}{D-1}}\le O\bigl( n \ell^{\frac{D}{D-1}} \bigr)$, where the logical operators are accurate up to $O\bigl( ( n \delta / d )^{1/2}\bigr)$ in operator norm. Finally, we prove that for two-dimensional systems if logical operators can be approximated by operators supported on constant-width flexible strings, then the dimension of the code space must be bounded. This supports one of the assumptions of algebraic anyon theories, that there exist only finitely many anyon types.",0

116826,2,"Path-sum solution of the Weyl Quantum Walk in 3+1 dimensions We consider the Weyl quantum walk in 3+1 dimensions, that is a discrete-time walk describing a particle with two internal degrees of freedom moving on a Cayley graph of the group $\mathbb Z^3$, that in an appropriate regime evolves according to Weyl's equation. The Weyl quantum walk was recently derived as the unique unitary evolution on a Cayley graph of $\mathbb Z^3$ that is homogeneous and isotropic. The general solution of the quantum walk evolution is provided here in the position representation, by the analytical expression of the propagator, i.e. transition amplitude from a node of the graph to another node in a finite number of steps. The quantum nature of the walk manifests itself in the interference of the paths on the graph joining the given nodes. The solution is based on the binary encoding of the admissible paths on the graph and on the semigroup structure of the walk transition matrices.",0
117582,2,"Squeezed atom laser for Bose-Einstein condensate with minimal length We study a protocol for constructing a squeezed atom laser for a model originating from the generalized uncertainty principle. We show that the squeezing effects arising from such systems do not require any squeezed light as an input, but the squeezing appears automatically because of the structure of the model it owns. The output atom laser beam becomes squeezed due to the nonlinear interaction between the Bose-Einstein condensate and the deformed radiation field created due to the noncommutative structure. We analyze several standard squeezing techniques based on the analytical expressions followed by a numerical analysis for further insights.",0

117962,2,"Magnetotransport in multi-Weyl semimetals: A kinetic theory approach We study longitudinal magnetotransport in three-dimensional multi-Weyl semimetals, constituted by pairs of (anti)-monopole of arbitrary integer charge $n$, with $n=1,2$ and $3$ in crystalline environment. For any $n>1$, even though the distribution of the underlying Berry curvature in the medium is \emph{anisotropic}, the corresponding intrinsic component of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity (bearing the signature of the chiral anomaly) is \emph{insensitive} to the direction of the external magnetic field ($B$) and increases as $B^2$, at least when it is sufficiently weak. In addition, the magnetoconductivity scales (roughly) as $n^3$ with the monopole charge. However, the net \emph{positive} longitudinal magnetoconductivity receives correction from other sources as well (such as the metallic contribution), which ultimately turns it into a direction dependent quantity for any $n>1$ (neglecting a velocity anisotropy for $n=1$), stemming from the underlying anisotropic quasiparticle dispersion in the system. The predicted scaling of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity and signature of the chiral anomaly can, in principle, be observed in recently proposed candidate materials for multi-Weyl semimetals in various solid state compounds.",0
118312,2,"Search for the magnetic monopole at a magnetoelectric surface We show, by solving Maxwell's equations, that an electric charge on the surface of a slab of a linear magnetoelectric material generates an image magnetic monopole below the surface provided that the magnetoelectric has a diagonal component in its magnetoelectric response. The image monopole, in turn, generates an ideal monopolar magnetic field outside of the slab. Using realistic values of the electric- and magnetic- field susceptibilties, we calculate the magnitude of the effect for the prototypical magnetoelectric material Cr$_2$O$_3$. We use low energy muon spin rotation to measure the strength of the magnetic field generated by charged muons as a function of their distance from the surface of a Cr$_2$O$_3$ films, and show that the results are consistent with the existence of the monopole. We discuss other possible routes to detecting the monopolar field, and show that, while the predicted monopolar field generated by Cr$_2$O$_3$ is above the detection limit for standard magnetic force microscopy, detection of the field using this technique is prevented by surface charging effects.",0

The theory shows that both dissipation and spatial nonlocality are necessary conditions for the existence of negative refraction. It also provides a sufficient condition in materials with weak spatial nonlocality. These fundamental results should have broad implications in the theoretical and practical analyses of negative refraction of electromagnetic and other kinds of waves.",0
120057,2,"Bloch groups, algebraic K-theory, units, and Nahm's Conjecture Given an element of the Bloch group of a number field~$F$ and a natural number~$m$, we construct an explicit unit in the field $F_m=F(e^{2 \pi i/m})$, well-defined up to $m$-th powers of nonzero elements of~$F_m$. The construction uses the cyclic quantum dilogarithm, and under the identification of the Bloch group of~$F$ with the $K$-group $K_3(F)$ gives an explicit formula for a certain abstract Chern class from~$K_3(F)$. The units we define are conjectured to coincide with numbers appearing in the quantum modularity conjecture for the Kashaev invariant of knots (which was the original motivation for our investigation), and also appear in the radial asymptotics of Nahm sums near roots of unity. This latter connection is used to prove one direction of Nahm's conjecture relating the modularity of certain $q$-hypergeometric series to the vanishing of the associated elements in the Bloch group of~$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$.",0
120587,2,"Two infinite families of resonant solutions for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation We consider the two-dimenstional Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing a Bose-Einstein condensate in an isotropic harmonic trap. In the small coupling regime, this equation is accurately approximated over long times by the corresponding nonlinear resonant system whose structure is determined by the fully resonant spectrum of the linearized problem. We focus on two types of consistent truncations of this resonant system: first, to sets of modes of fixed angular momentum, and second, to excited Landau levels. Each of these truncations admits a set of explicit analytic solutions with initial conditions parametrized by three complex numbers. Viewed in position space, the fixed angular momentum solutions describe modulated oscillations of dark rings, while the excited Landau level solutions describe modulated precession of small arrays of vortices and antivortices. We place our findings in the context of similar results for other spatially confined nonlinear Hamiltonian systems in recent literature.",0
120690,2,"The attraction between antiferromagnetic quantum vortices as origin of superconductivity in cuprates We propose as key of superconductivity in (hole-doped) cuprates a novel excitation of magnetic origin, characteristic of two-dimensions and of purely quantum nature: the antiferromagnetic spin vortices. In this formalism the charge pairing arises from a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like attraction between such vortices centered on opposite N\'eel sublattices. This charge pairing induces also the spin pairing through the action of a gauge force generated by the no-double occupation constraint imposed in the t-J model of the CuO planes of the cuprates. Superconductivity arises from coherence of pairs of excitations describing Zhang-Rice singlets and it is not of standard BCS type. We show that many experimental features of the cuprates can find a natural explanation in this formalism.",0

Skyrmions are the subject of intense experimental and theoretical investigation and have potential technological spintronic applications. Here we show that numerical computations of frustrated magnets predict that Skyrmions can be tied into knots to form new stable three-dimensional nanoparticles. These stable equilibria of twisted loops of Skyrmion strings have an integer-valued topological charge, known as the Hopf charge, that counts the number of particles. Rings are formed for low values of this charge, but for higher values it is energetically favorable to form links and then knots. This computational study provides a novel impetus for future experimental work on these nanoknots and an exploration of the potential technological applications of three-dimensional nanoparticles encoding knotted magnetization.",0
121088,2,"Coupling magneto-elastic Lagrangians to spin transfer torque sources The consequences of coupling magnetic and elastic degrees of freedom, where spins and deformations are carried by point-like objects subject to local interactions, are studied, theoretically and by detailed numerical simulations. From the constrained Lagrangians we derive consistent equations of motion for the coupled dynamical variables. In order to probe the dynamics of such a system, we consider external perturbations, such as spin transfer torques for the magnetic part, and homogeneous stresses for the elastic part, associated to their corresponding damping. This approach is applied to the study of ultrafast switching processes in anti-ferromagnetic systems, which have recently attracted attention as candidates for anti-ferromagnetic spintronic devices. Our strategy is then checked in simple, but instructive, situations. We carried out numerical experiments to study, in particular, how the magnetostrictive coupling and external stresses affect the nature of the switching processes in a prototype anti-ferromagnetic material.",0
121373,2,"Generic emergence of objectivity of observables in infinite dimensions Quantum Darwinism posits that information becomes objective whenever multiple observers indirectly probe a quantum system by each measuring a fraction of the environment. It was recently shown that objectivity of observables emerges generically from the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics, whenever the system of interest has finite dimensions and the number of environment fragments is large [F. G. S. L. Brand\~ao, M. Piani, and P. Horodecki, Nature Commun. 6, 7908 (2015)]. Despite the importance of this result, it necessarily excludes many practical systems of interest that are infinite-dimensional, including harmonic oscillators. Extending the study of Quantum Darwinism to infinite dimensions is a nontrivial task: we tackle it here by using a modified diamond norm, suitable to quantify the distinguishability of channels in infinite dimensions. We prove two theorems that bound the emergence of objectivity, first for finite energy systems, and then for systems that can only be prepared in states with an exponential energy cut-off. We show that the latter class of states includes any bounded-energy subset of single-mode Gaussian states.",0
121521,2,"Agencies and Science-Experiment Risk There is a curious absence of legal constraints on U.S. government agencies undertaking potentially risky scientific research. Some of these activities may present a risk of killing millions or even destroying the planet. Current law leaves it to agencies to decide for themselves whether their activities fall within the bounds of acceptable risk. This Article explores to what extent and under what circumstances the law ought to allow private actions against such non-regulatory agency endeavors. Engaging with this issue is not only interesting in its own right, it allows us to test fundamental concepts of agency competence and the role of the courts. Two case studies provide a foundation for discussion: NASA's use of plutonium power supplies on spacecraft, which critics say could cause millions of cancers in the event of atmospheric disintegration, and a Department of Energy particle-collider experiment (the RHIC, or Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) that allegedly poses a small risk of collapsing the Earth (via a ""killer strangelet""). These extreme examples serve as a test-bed for applying insights from neoclassical economics, behavioral economics, risk-management studies, and cognitive psychology. The resulting analysis suggests that in low-probability/high-harm scenarios, agencies are likely to do a poor job of judging the acceptability of risk to the public. Instead, generalist judges working in a common-law vein may have surprising advantages. This in turns suggests that under certain circumstances the government should be subject to legal action that provides non-deferential review of discretionary agency actions that are non-regulatory in nature.",0

These filters are used to flag papers in need of further review by human assessors before being promulgated on the server; papers not flagged by the algorithm are generally posted on arXiv without further review.

123523,2,"Towards a demystification of quantum mechanics Quantum Mechanics is being included in numerous school programmes as part of the curriculum. Most modern textbooks introduce it emphasising its strange or, at least uncommon, somewhat paradoxical, character. We argue that such an approach is wrong because rather than attracting the interest of students toward the topic, it makes quantum mechanics almost unbelievable and artificial. The resulting perception is that quantum mechanics is in fact not understood at all and that we need a new theory that eventually will supersede it.In contrast, we propose a new approach on classical physics that, stressing the role of the measurements in physics, introduces the concept of state very early in the curriculum. Such a concept is reviewed on each classical physics topic and the concept of force as a vector is almost abandoned for the concept of interaction defined as something that change the state.In this way it is possible to introduce quantum mechanics without violating any conviction the students acquired learning classical physics. In other words quantum mechanics appears to be as natural as classical physics, at least from the point of view of the results of the experiments.",0

In this paper we are concerned with the question how the internode scattering affects the conductivity. We use and compare two established techniques for treating the disorder scattering: The perturbation theory, there ladder and maximally crossed diagrams are summed up, and the functional integral approach. Both turn out to be entirely equivalent. For a large number of random potential configurations we have found only two different conductivity scenarios. Both scenarios appear independently of whether the disorder does or does not create the internode scattering. In particular we do not confirm the conjecture that the internode scattering tends to Anderson localization.",0

On the other hand we have chaotic, uniformly hyperbolic Anosov C-systems defined on tori which have mixing of all orders and nonzero Kolmogorov entropy. These extraordinary ergodic properties of deterministic Anosov C-systems ensure that the above classical limit theorems for sums of independent random variables in probability theory are fulfilled by the time averages for the sequences generated by the C-systems.

Since the celebrated work of Kolmogorov in 1941, understanding the statistical properties of fully developed turbulence has remained a major quest. In particular, deriving the properties of turbulent flows from a mesoscopic description, that is from Navier-Stokes equation, has eluded most theoretical attempts. Here, we provide a theoretical prediction for the {\it space and time} dependent velocity-velocity correlation function of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence from the field theory associated to Navier-Stokes equation with stochastic forcing. This prediction is the analytical fixed-point solution of Non-Perturbative Renormalisation Group flow equations, which are exact in a certain large wave-number limit. This solution is compared to two-point two-times correlation functions computed in direct numerical simulations. We obtain a remarkable agreement both in the inertial and in the dissipative ranges.",0
128699,2,"Entanglement dynamics for uniformly accelerated two-level atoms in the presence of a reflecting boundary We study the entanglement dynamics for two uniformly accelerated two-level atoms in interaction with a bath of fluctuating electromagnetic fields in vacuum in the presence of a reflecting boundary. We consider two different alignments of atoms, i.e. parallel and vertical alignments with respect to the boundary. In particular, we focus on the effects of the boundary, and acceleration on the entanglement dynamics, which are closely related to the orientations of polarization. For the parallel case, the initial entanglement of two transversely polarizable atoms very close to the boundary can be preserved as if it were a closed system, while for two vertically polarizable atoms, the concurrence evolves two times as fast as that in the free space. In the presence of a boundary, entanglement revival is possible for two atoms initially in the symmetric state depending on the orientations of the atomic polarizations, which is in sharp contrast to the fact that the concurrence always decays monotonically in the free space. Interestingly, two initially separable atoms, for which entanglement generation can never happen in the free space with any given acceleration and separation, can get entangled in the presence of a boundary if they are aligned parallel to the boundary. The birth time of entanglement can be noticeably advanced or postponed for the parallel two-atom system placed close to the boundary, while the maximal concurrence during evolution can be significantly enhanced when the atoms are vertically aligned. Moreover, two inertial atoms with different polarizations remain separable all the time, while as the acceleration increases, the delayed birth of entanglement happens, and the nonzero concurrence can be enhanced.",0

The second conjecture claims that all the mixing matrices $U_{i}$ in the relation $\mathcal{R}_i = U_i\mathcal{R}_1U_i^{-1}$ between the ith and the first generators $\mathcal{R}_i$ of the braid group are universally expressible through the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{R}_1$ .

We furthermore identify signatures of fluctuating density waves in frequency and spatially resolved conductivities. Phase disordering is well known to lead to a large viscosity.

In the limit $N \rightarrow 1$, $\tau \rightarrow \tau_0$, such that $\tau_0$ is finite, we recover the off-critical local height probability on a plane, $\tau_0$-away from criticality. In the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$, $\tau \rightarrow 0$, such that $N \, \tau = \tau_0$ is finite, and following a conformal transformation, we obtain a critical partition function on a cylinder of aspect-ratio $\tau_0$.

131183,2,"The correct formulation of Gleason's theorem in quaternionic Hilbert spaces From the viewpoint of the theory of orthomodular lattices of elementary propositions, Quantum Theories can be formulated in real, complex or quaternionic Hilbert spaces as established in Sol\'er's theorem. The said lattice eventually coincides with the lattice of all orthogonal projectors on a separable Hilbert space over R, C, or over the algebra of quaternions H. Quantum states are $\sigma$-additive probability measures on that non-Boolean lattice. Gleason's theorem proves that, if the Hilbert space is separable with dimension >2 and the Hilbert space is either real or complex, then states are one-to-one with standard density matrices (self-adjoint, positive, unit-trace, trace-class operators). The extension of this result to quaternionic Hilbert spaces was obtained by Varadarajan in 1968. Unfortunately, even if the hard part of the proof is correct, the formulation of this extension is mathematically incorrect. This is due to some peculiarities of the notion of trace in quaternionic Hilbert spaces, e.g., basis dependence, making the theory of trace-class operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces different from the standard theory in real and complex Hilbert spaces. A minor issue also affects Varadarajan's statement for real Hilbert space formulation. This paper is mainly devoted to present Gleason-Varadarajan's theorem into a technically correct form valid for the three types of Hilbert spaces. After having develped part of the general mathematical technology of trace-class operators in (generally non-separable) quaternionic Hilbert spaces, we prove that only the {\em real part} of the trace enters the formalism of quantum theories (also dealing with unbounded observables and symmetries) and it can be safely used to formulate and prove a common statement of Gleason's theorem.",0

We find that with optical photolithography, residual resist and process contamination is unavoidable, ultimately limiting device performance and yield. However, using Y sacrificial layers to isolate the graphene from processing conditions improves the yield (from 73% to 97%), average device performance (three-fold increase of mobility, 58% lower contact resistance), and the device-to-device variability (standard deviation of Dirac voltage reduced by 20%).

The effective spacetime is the Eisenhart-Duval lift of the dynamics experienced by Galilei invariant Lévy-Leblond spin-12 particles near the Dirac points. We find that changing the intrinsic curvature of the bilayer sheet induces a change in the energy level of the electronic bands, switching from a conducting regime for negative curvature to an insulating one when curvature is positive. In particular, curving graphene bilayers allow opening or closing the energy gap between conduction and valence bands, a key effect for electronic devices. Thus, using curvature as a tunable parameter opens the way for the beginning of curvatronics in bilayer graphene.",0
