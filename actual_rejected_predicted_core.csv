145,0,"A method for Hamiltonian truncation: A four-wave example A method for extracting finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems from a class of 2+1 Hamiltonian mean field theories is presented. These theories possess noncanonical Poisson brackets, which normally resist Hamiltonian truncation, but a process of beatification by coordinate transformation near a reference state is described in order to perturbatively overcome this difficulty. Two examples of four-wave truncation of Euler's equation for scalar vortex dynamics are given and compared: one a direct non-Hamiltonian truncation of the equations of motion, the other obtained by beatifying the Poisson bracket and then truncating.",2
1280,0,"Recursion relations for Double Ramification Hierarchies In this paper we study various properties of the double ramification hierarchy, an integrable hierarchy of hamiltonian PDEs introduced in [Bur15] using intersection theory of the double ramification cycle in the moduli space of stable curves. In particular, we prove a recursion formula that recovers the full hierarchy starting from just one of the Hamiltonians, the one associated to the first descendant of the unit of a cohomological field theory. Moreover, we introduce analogues of the topological recursion relations and the divisor equation both for the hamiltonian densities and for the string solution of the double ramification hierarchy. This machinery is very efficient and we apply it to various computations for the trivial and Hodge cohomological field theories, and for the $r$-spin Witten's classes. Moreover we prove the Miura equivalence between the double ramification hierarchy and the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy for the Gromov-Witten theory of the complex projective line (extended Toda hierarchy).",2
1563,0,"A survey on mixed spin P-fields This is a survey on the mixed spin P-fields (MSP fields for short) theory which provides a platform to understand the phase transition between Gromov-Witten theory of quintic CY 3-folds and Landau-Ginzburg theory of the corresponding quintic polynomials. It discusses key ideas that lead to the definition of MSP fields and how moduli of stable maps to the quintic and that of 5-spin curves appear in the moduli of MSP fields. It also explains some properties of the moduli of MSP fields such as the cosection localisation, the properness of the degeneracy locus, and a torus action on the moduli.. Some vanishings arising from the torus action provide polynomial relations among GW-invarants and FJRW-invaraints which give an effective algorithm for the computation of those invariants. Some examples of computations of genus 1 low degree of GW invariants are provided.",2
1801,0,"Brownian Loops and Conformal Fields The main topic of these lecture notes is the continuum scaling limit of planar lattice models. One reason why this topic occupies an important place in the theory of probability and mathematical statistical physics is that scaling limits provide the link between statistical mechanics and (Euclidean) field theory. In order to explain the main ideas behind the concept of scaling limit, I will focus on a ""toy"" model that exhibits the typical behavior of statistical mechanical models at and near the critical point. This model, known as the random walk loop soup, is actually interesting in its own right. It can be described as a Poissonian ensemble of lattice loops, or a lattice gas of loops since it fits within the ideal gas framework of statistical mechanics. After introducing the model and discussing some interesting connections with the discrete Gaussian free field, I will present some results concerning its scaling limit, which leads to a Poissonian ensemble of continuum loops known as the Brownian loop soup. The latter was introduced by Lawler and Werner and is a very interesting object with connections to the Schramm-Loewner Evolution and various models of statistical mechanics. In the second part of the lectures, I will use the Brownian loop soup to construct a family of functions that behave like correlation functions of a conformal field. I will then use these functions and their derivation to introduce the concept of conformal field and to explore the connection between scaling limits and conformal fields.",2

3137,0,"High-energy and smoothness asymptotic expansion of the scattering amplitude for the Dirac equation and applications We obtain an explicit formula for the diagonal singularities of the scattering amplitude for the Dirac equation with short-range electromagnetic potentials. Using this expansion we uniquely reconstruct an electric potential and magnetic field from the high-energy limit of the scattering amplitude. Moreover, supposing that the electric potential and magnetic field are asymptotic sums of homogeneous terms we give the unique reconstruction procedure for these asymptotics from the scattering amplitude, known for some energy $E.$ Furthermore, we prove that the set of the averaged scattering solutions to the Dirac equation is dense in the set of all solutions to the Dirac equation that are in $L^{2}\left( \Omega\right) ,$ where $\Omega$ is any connected bounded open set in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with smooth boundary, and we show that if we know an electric potential and a magnetic field for $\mathbb{R}^{3}\setminus\Omega$, then the scattering amplitude, given for some energy $E$, uniquely determines these electric potential and magnetic field everywhere in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Combining this uniqueness result with the reconstruction procedure for the asymptotics of the electric potential and the magnetic field we show that the scattering amplitude, known for some $E$, uniquely determines a electric potential and a magnetic field, that are asymptotic sums of homogeneous terms, which converges to the electric potential and the magnetic field, respectively. Moreover, we discuss the symmetries of the kernel of the scattering matrix, which follow from the parity, charge-conjugation and time-reversal transformations for the Dirac operator.",2
3216,0,"Dynamical complexity in the quantum to classical transition We study the dynamical complexity of an open quantum driven double-well oscillator, mapping its dependence on effective Planck's constant $\hbar_{eff}\equiv\beta$ and coupling to the environment, $\Gamma$. We study this using stochastic Schrodinger equations, semiclassical equations, and the classical limit equation. We show that (i) the dynamical complexity initially increases with effective Hilbert space size (as $\beta$ decreases) such that the most quantum systems are the least dynamically complex. (ii) If the classical limit is chaotic, that is the most dynamically complex (iii) if the classical limit is regular, there is always a quantum system more dynamically complex than the classical system. There are several parameter regimes where the quantum system is chaotic even though the classical limit is not. While some of the quantum chaotic attractors are of the same family as the classical limiting attractors, we also find a quantum attractor with no classical counterpart. These phenomena occur in experimentally accessible regimes.",2

As an application, we show that if $X$ satisfies the GW/DT correspondence for primary insertions and descendants of the point class, then so does $X'$. We also propose a conjectural flop formula for general flops.",2
5933,0,"Permutation Symmetry Determines the Discrete Wigner Function The Wigner function provides a useful quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics, with applications in various branches of physics. Many nice properties of the Wigner function are intimately connected with the high symmetry of the underlying operator basis composed of phase point operators: any pair of phase point operators can be transformed to any other pair by a unitary symmetry transformation. We prove that, in the discrete scenario, this permutation symmetry is equivalent to the symmetry group being a unitary 2-design. Such a highly symmetric representation can only appear in odd prime power dimensions besides dimensions 2 and 8. It suffices to single out a unique discrete Wigner function among all possible quasiprobability representations. In the course of our study, we show that this discrete Wigner function is uniquely determined by Clifford covariance, while no Wigner function is Clifford covariant in any even prime power dimension.",2

7061,0,"Brownian motion correlation in the peanosphere for $\kappa &gt; 8$ The peanosphere (or ""mating of trees"") construction of Duplantier, Miller, and Sheffield encodes certain types of $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces ($\gamma \in (0,2)$) decorated with an independent SLE$_{\kappa}$ ($\kappa = 16/\gamma^2 &gt; 4$) in terms of a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion and provides a framework for showing that random planar maps decorated with statistical physics models converge to LQG decorated with an SLE. Previously, the correlation for the Brownian motion was only explicitly identified as $-\cos(4\pi/\kappa)$ for $\kappa \in (4,8]$ and unknown for $\kappa &gt; 8$. The main result of this work is that this formula holds for all $\kappa &gt; 4$. This supplies the missing ingredient for proving convergence results of the aforementioned type for $\kappa &gt; 8$. Our proof is based on the calculation of a certain tail exponent for SLE$_{\kappa}$ on a quantum wedge and then matching it with an exponent which is well-known for Brownian motion.",2
7485,0,"Towards the topological quantization of classical mechanics We consider the method of topological quantization for conservative systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Maupertuis' formalism for classical mechanics provides an appropriate scenario which permit us to adapt the method of topological quantization, originally formulated for gravitational field configurations.

Our findings directly imply the recently found tensor product structure of the Wigner transform of Hagedorn wave packets.",2
8027,0,"Fault-tolerant error correction with the gauge color code The constituent parts of a quantum computer are inherently vulnerable to errors. To this end we have developed quantum error-correcting codes to protect quantum information from noise. However, discovering codes that are capable of a universal set of computational operations with the minimal cost in quantum resources remains an important and ongoing challenge. One proposal of significant recent interest is the gauge color code. Notably, this code may offer a reduced resource cost over other well-studied fault-tolerant architectures using a new method, known as gauge fixing, for performing the non-Clifford logical operations that are essential for universal quantum computation. Here we examine the gauge color code when it is subject to noise. Specifically we make use of single-shot error correction to develop a simple decoding algorithm for the gauge color code, and we numerically analyse its performance. Remarkably, we find threshold error rates comparable to those of other leading proposals. Our results thus provide encouraging preliminary data of a comparative study between the gauge color code and other promising computational architectures.",2
8371,0,"Toeplitz Quantization for Non-commutating Symbol Spaces such as $SU_q(2)$ Toeplitz quantization is defined in a general setting in which the symbols are the elements of a possibly non-commutative algebra with a conjugation and a possibly degenerate inner product. We show that the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ is such an algebra. Unlike many quantization schemes, this Toeplitz quantization does not require a measure. The theory is based on the mathematical structures defined and studied in several recent papers of the author; those papers dealt with some specific examples of this new Toeplitz quantization. Annihilation and creation operators are defined as densely defined Toeplitz operators acting in a quantum Hilbert space, and their commutation relations are discussed. At this point Planck's constant is introduced into the theory. Due to the possibility of non-commuting symbols, there are now two definitions for anti-Wick quantization; these two definitions are equivalent in the commutative case. The Toeplitz quantization introduced here satisfies one of these definitions, but not necessarily the other. This theory should be considered as a second quantization, since it quantizes non-commutative (that is, already quantum) objects. The quantization theory presented here has two essential features of a physically useful quantization: Planck's constant and a Hilbert space where natural, densely defined operators act.",2
8514,0,"P, C and T: Different Properties on the Kinematical Level We study the discrete symmetries (P,C and T) on the kinematical level within the extended Poincare Group. On the basis of the Silagadze research, we investigate the question of the definitions of the discrete symmetry operators both on the classical level, and in the secondary-quantization scheme. We study the physical contents within several bases: light-front formulation, helicity basis, angular momentum basis, and so on, on several practical examples. We analise problems in construction of the neutral particles in the the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) representation, the (1,0)+(0,1) and the (1/2,1/2) representations of the Lorentz Group. As well known, the photon has the quantum numbers 1^-, so the (1,0)+(0,1) representation of the Lorentz group is relevant to its description. We have ambiguities in the definitions of the corresponding operators P, C; T, which lead to different physical consequences. It appears that the answers are connected with the helicity basis properties, and commutations/anticommutations of the corresponding operators, P, C, T, and C^2, P^2, (CP)^2 properties.",2
9744,0,"The role of symmetry in the interpretation of quantum mechanics Despite the impressive amount of literature on the foundations of quantum mechanics, the relevance of symmetry in interpretation is not properly acknowledged. In fact, although it is usually said that quantum mechanics is invariant under the Galilean group, the invariance is usually not discussed in the case of the interpretation of the theory. This situation is particularly pressing for realist positions, which want to know how reality would be if quantum mechanics were true. From a realist perspective, it seems reasonable to require that an interpretation of quantum mechanics, to be admissible, preserves the same symmetries of the theory. In this paper we will take a realist standpoint in order to study what physical constraints the Galilean group imposes on interpretation, and we will extrapolate the conclusions drawn for quantum mechanics to the case of quantum field theory.",2

Lett. 115, 180405}] can be used to implement local scale transformations on these objects, namely a lattice version of conformal maps. Specifically, we explain how to implement the lattice equivalent of the logarithmic conformal map that transforms the Euclidean plane into a cylinder. As an application, and with the 2D critical Ising model as a concrete example, we use this map to build a lattice version of the scaling operators of the underlying conformal field theory, from which one can extract their scaling dimensions and operator product expansion coefficients.",2
11130,0,"Application of the iterative approach to modal methods for the solution of Maxwell's equations In this work we discuss the possibility to reduce the computational complexity of modal methods, i.e. methods based on eigenmodes expansion, from the third power to the second power of the number of eigenmodes. The proposed approach is based on the calculation of the eigenmodes part by part by using shift-and-invert iterative technique and by applying the iterative approach to solve linear equations to compute eigenmodes expansion coefficients. As practical implementation, the iterative modal methods based on polynomials and trigonometric functions as well as on finite-difference scheme are developed. Alternatives to the scattering matrix (S-matrix) technique which are based on pure iterative or mixed direct-iteractive approaches allowing to markedly reduce the number of required numerical operations are discussed. Additionally, the possibility of diminishing the memory demand of the whole algorithm from second to first power of the number of modes by implementing the iterative approach is demonstrated. This allows to carry out calculations up to hundreds of thousands eigenmodes without using a supercomputer.",2

12403,0,Identities for the arctangent function by enhanced midpoint integration and the high-accuracy computation of pi We describe a method of integration to obtain identities of the arctangent function and show how this method can be applied to the high-accuracy computation of the constant pi using the equation $\pi = 4 \arctan \left( 1 \right)$. Our approach combines the midpoint method with the Taylor expansion series to enhance accuracy in the subintervals. The accuracy of this method of integration is determined by number of subintervals $L$ and by order of the Taylor expansion $M$. This approach provides significant flexibility in computation since the required convergence in resulting equations can be optimized through appropriate choices for the integers $L$ and $M$. Sample computations are presented to illustrate that even with relatively small values of the integers $L$ and $M$ the constant $\pi$ can be computed with high accuracy.,2

Afterwards, we extend the $q$-Toda hierarchy to an extended $q$-Toda hierarchy(EQTH) which satisfy a generalized Hirota quadratic equation in terms of generalized vertex operators. The Hirota quadratic equation might have further application in Gromov-Witten theory. The corresponding Sato theory including multi-fold Darboux transformations of this extended hierarchy is also constructed.

We first develop a rotationally invariant parametrization of such matrices, previously only constructed in a preferred basis. For example, an arbitrary choice of a vector and two commuting Hermitian matrices defines a type-1 family and vice versa. Higher types similarly involve a random vector and two matrices.

Then the label of these particles are measured at the end. We prove that additive approximation to single amplitudes of these models can be obtained by the one-clean-qubit model, if no initial superpositions are allowed. However, if arbitrary initial states and non-adaptive intermediate measurements are allowed, we show that conditioned on infinite polynomial hierarchy assumption it is hard to sample from the output distribution of these models on a classical randomized computer. A classical analogue of this model is also formalized and its computational power is pinned down within the complexity classes below BPP and NP.",2

The quantity is depenedent on the full structure of the underlying conformal field theory and so useful to find the universality class of the critical system. The connection that we find also provides a very efficient numerical method to calculate the Casimir energy between needles using quantum critical chains.

For the case of a statistically homogeneous or periodic composite the expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of positive semidefinite normalization matrices alternating with positive semidefinite weight matrices, which at each given level sum to the identity matrix. In an appropriate basis the projection operators onto the relevant subspaces can be expressed in block tridiagonal form, where the blocks are functions of these weight and normalization matrices. This leads to continued fraction expansions for the effective tensor, and by truncating the continued fraction at successive levels one obtains a nested sequence of bounds on the effective tensor incorporating successively more weight and normalization matrices.

26375,0,"The split property for locally covariant quantum field theories in curved spacetime The split property expresses the way in which local regions of spacetime define subsystems of a quantum field theory. It is known to hold for general theories in Minkowski space under the hypothesis of nuclearity. Here, the split property is discussed for general locally covariant quantum field theories in arbitrary globally hyperbolic curved spacetimes, using a spacetime deformation argument to transport the split property from one spacetime to another. It is also shown how states obeying both the split and (partial) Reeh-Schlieder properties can be constructed, providing standard split inclusions of certain local von Neumann algebras. Sufficient conditions are given for the theory to admit such states in ultrastatic spacetimes, from which the general case follows. A number of consequences are described, including the existence of local generators for global gauge transformations, and the classification of certain local von Neumann algebras. Similar arguments are applied to the distal split property and circumstances are exhibited under which distal splitting implies the full split property.",2
27215,0,"Surjectivity of a Gluing Construction in Special Lagrangian Geometry This paper is motivated by a relatively recent work by Joyce in special Lagrangian geometry, but the basic idea of the present paper goes back to an earlier pioneering work of Donaldson in Yang--Mills gauge theory; Donaldson discovered a global structure of a (compactified) moduli space of Yang--Mills instantons, and a key step to that result was the proof of surjectivity of Taubes' gluing construction. In special Lagrangian geometry we have currently no such a global understanding of (compactified) moduli spaces, but in the present paper we determine a neighbourhood of a `boundary' point. It is locally similar to Donaldson's result, and in particular as Donaldson's result implies the surjectivity of Taubes' gluing construction so our result implies the surjectivity of Joyce's gluing construction in a certain simple case.",2
27611,0,"Counting curves on surfaces In this paper we consider an elementary, and largely unexplored, combinatorial problem in low-dimensional topology. Consider a real 2-dimensional compact surface $S$, and fix a number of points $F$ on its boundary. We ask: how many configurations of disjoint arcs are there on $S$ whose boundary is $F$? We find that this enumerative problem, counting curves on surfaces, has a rich structure. For instance, we show that the curve counts obey an effective recursion, in the general framework of topological recursion. Moreover, they exhibit quasi-polynomial behaviour. This ""elementary curve-counting"" is in fact related to a more advanced notion of ""curve-counting"" from algebraic geometry or symplectic geometry. The asymptotics of this enumerative problem are closely related to the asymptotics of volumes of moduli spaces of curves, and the quasi-polynomials governing the enumerative problem encode intersection numbers on moduli spaces. Furthermore, among several other results, we show that generating functions and differential forms for these curve counts exhibit structure that is reminiscent of the mathematical physics of free energies, partition functions, topological recursion, and quantum curves.",2

We first show that the division between the regimes $q &lt; 1$ and $q &gt; 1$ is already inherent in the fundamental incomplete structure of the deformed logarithms and exponentials underlying the Tsallis entropy. Then, we provide the complete deformed functions and show that the Tsallis entropy conforms to the third law of thermodynamics for both super-additive $q &lt; 1$ and sub-additive $q &gt; 1$ regimes.

29448,0,"Dirichlet-Neumann inverse spectral problem for a star graph of Stieltjes strings We solve two inverse spectral problems for star graphs of Stieltjes strings with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, respectively, at a selected vertex called root. The root is either the central vertex or, in the more challenging problem, a pendant vertex of the star graph. At all other pendant vertices Dirichlet conditions are imposed; at the central vertex, at which a mass may be placed, continuity and Kirchhoff conditions are assumed. We derive conditions on two sets of real numbers to be the spectra of the above Dirichlet and Neumann problems. Our solution for the inverse problems is constructive: we establish algorithms to recover the mass distribution on the star graph (i.e. the point masses and lengths of subintervals between them) from these two spectra and from the lengths of the separate strings. If the root is a pendant vertex, the two spectra uniquely determine the parameters on the main string (i.e. the string incident to the root) if the length of the main string is known. The mass distribution on the other edges need not be unique; the reason for this is the non-uniqueness caused by the non-strict interlacing of the given data in the case when the root is the central vertex. Finally, we relate of our results to tree-patterned matrix inverse problems.",2

Besides, our derivation is a continuous field theoretic derivation by using path integration, different from the traditional derivations which are based on lattice theory or based on Coulomb gas model. Our new derivation rely on Abelian duality of two dimensional quantum field theory. By utilizing this duality in path integration, we find that the vortex configurations are naturally mapped to exponential operators in dual description, these operators are the vortex operators that can create vortices, the sine-Gordon description then naturally follows.

In this paper, we study the continuum limit of a wide class of QWs, and show that it leads to an entire class of PDEs, encompassing the Hamiltonian form of the massive Dirac equation in $(1+1)$ curved spacetime. Therefore a certain QW, which we make explicit, provides us with a unitary discrete toy model of a test particle in curved spacetime, in spite of the fixed background lattice.

30817,0,"Extended Hamilton-Lagrange formalism and its application to Feynman's path integral for relativistic quantum physics With this paper, a consistent and comprehensive treatise on the foundations of the extended Hamilton-Lagrange formalism will be presented. In this formalism, the system's dynamics is parametrized along a time-like system evolution parameter $s$, and the physical time $t$ is treated as a dependent variable $t(s)$ on equal footing with all other configuration space variables $q^{i}(s)$. In the action principle, the conventional classical action $L dt$ is then replaced by the generalized action $L_{e}ds$, with $L$ and $L_{e}$ denoting the conventional and the extended Lagrangian, respectively. In the existing literature, the discussion is restricted to only those extended Lagrangians $L_{e}$ that are homogeneous forms of first order in the velocities. It is shown that a class of extended Lagrangians $L_{e}$ exists that are correlated to corresponding conventional Lagrangians $L$ without being homogeneous functions in the velocities. Then the Legendre transformation of $L_{e}$ to an extended Hamiltonian $H_{e}$ exists. With this class of extended Hamiltonians, an extended canonical formalism is presented that is completely analogous to the conventional Hamiltonian formalism. The physical time $t$ and the negative value of the conventional Hamiltonian then constitute and an additional pair of conjugate canonical variables. The extended formalism also includes a theory of extended canonical transformations, where the time variable $t(s)$ is also subject to transformation. In the extended formalism, the system's dynamics is described as a motion on a hypersurface within an extended phase space of even dimension. It is shown that the hypersurface condition does not embody a constraint as the condition is automatically satisfied on the system path that is given by the solution of the extended set of canonical equations.",2

We show that in all these cases but the periodic one with an even number of sites $\mathsf{N}$, the transfer matrix of the model is related, by the vertex-IRF transformation, to the transfer matrix of the dynamical 6-vertex model with antiperiodic boundary conditions, which we have recently solved by means of Sklyanin's Separation of Variables (SOV) approach. We show moreover that, in all the twisted cases, the vertex-IRF transformation is bijective. This allows us to completely characterize, from our previous results on the antiperiodic dynamical 6-vertex model, the twisted 8-vertex transfer matrix spectrum (proving that it is simple) and eigenstates. We also consider the periodic case for $\mathsf{N}$ odd. In this case we can define two independent vertex-IRF transformations, both not bijective, and by using them we show that the 8-vertex transfer matrix spectrum is doubly degenerate, and that it can, as well as the corresponding eigenstates, also be completely characterized in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of the dynamical 6-vertex antiperiodic transfer matrix. In all these cases we can adapt to the 8-vertex case the reformulations of the dynamical 6-vertex transfer matrix spectrum and eigenstates that had been obtained by $T$-$Q$ functional equations, where the $Q$-functions are elliptic polynomials with twist-dependent quasi-periods. Such reformulations enables one to characterize the 8-vertex transfer matrix spectrum by the solutions of some Bethe-type equations, and to rewrite the corresponding eigenstates as the multiple action of some operators on a pseudo-vacuum state, in a similar way as in the algebraic Bethe ansatz framework.",2

31537,0,"Topological Origin of the Fermion Sign Problem Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool for elucidating the properties of complex systems across many disciplines. Not requiring any a priori knowledge, they are particularly well suited for exploring new phenomena. However, when applied to fermionic quantum systems, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms suffer from the so-called ""negative sign problem"", which causes the computational effort to grow exponentially with problem size. Here we demonstrate that the fermion sign problem originates in topological properties of the configurations. In particular, we show that in the widely used auxiliary field approaches the negative sign of a configuration is a geometric phase that is the imaginary time counterpart of the Aharonov-Anandan phase, and reduces to a Berry phase in the adiabatic limit. This provides an intriguing connection between QMC simulations and classification of topological states. Our results shed clarify the controversially debated origin of the sign problem in fermionic lattice models.",2

33439,0,"Physical Version of Singularity Resolution in the Observable Universe Based on the equivalence of the two different types of measurement protocols and the asymmetry between the Schr\""odinger and Heisenberg pictures, it has been previously proposed that negative sea fills the universe as a nondeterministic computation - a time-reversal process of the irreversible computations presented since the big bang. The goal of this paper is to extend the proposed subjective universe model, i.e., the universe as a quantum measurement: Motivated by the relationship between quantum theory and classical probability theory with continuity, it is argued that the frame of reference of the observer may be identified with classical probability theory where its choice, along with big bang singularity, should correspond to the quantum observable. That is, the physical version of singularity resolution corresponds to the case, where big bang singularity is equivalent to the continuity of the negative sea, or aether, filling the universe as a frame of reference of the observer. Moreover, based on the holographic principle, we identify the choice of the observer with the degrees of freedom proportional to the Planck area on the horizon.

The degree of degeneracy may be thus used as a new geometric measure of entanglement and we show how to calculate it for various multiparticle systems providing also simple criteria of separability. The presented method is general and can be applied also under different additional symmetry conditions stemming, eg. from the indistinguishability of particles.",2
36405,0,"A Comprehensive Perspective on Pilot-Job Systems Pilot-Job systems play an important role in supporting distributed scientific computing. They are used to consume more than 700 million CPU hours a year by the Open Science Grid communities, and by processing up to 1 million jobs a day for the ATLAS experiment on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. With the increasing importance of task-level parallelism in high-performance computing, Pilot-Job systems are also witnessing an adoption beyond traditional domains. Notwithstanding the growing impact on scientific research, there is no agreement upon a definition of Pilot-Job system and no clear understanding of the underlying abstraction and paradigm. Pilot-Job implementations have proliferated with no shared best practices or open interfaces and little interoperability. Ultimately, this is hindering the realization of the full impact of Pilot-Jobs by limiting their robustness, portability, and maintainability. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of Pilot-Job systems critically assessing their motivations, evolution, properties, and implementation. The three main contributions of this paper are: (i) an analysis of the motivations and evolution of Pilot-Job systems; (ii) an outline of the Pilot abstraction, its distinguishing logical components and functionalities, its terminology, and its architecture pattern; and (iii) the description of core and auxiliary properties of Pilot-Jobs systems and the analysis of seven exemplar Pilot-Job implementations. Together, these contributions illustrate the Pilot paradigm, its generality, and how it helps to address some challenges in distributed scientific computing.",2
36868,0,"Scaling limits for the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn model on a random planar map I: cone times Sheffield (2011) introduced an inventory accumulation model which encodes a random planar map decorated by a collection of loops sampled from the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) model. He showed that a certain two-dimensional random walk associated with an infinite-volume version of the model converges in the scaling limit to a correlated planar Brownian motion. We improve on this scaling limit result by showing that the times corresponding to FK loops (or ""flexible orders"") in the inventory accumulation model converge in the scaling limit to the $\pi/2$-cone times of the correlated Brownian motion. This statement implies a scaling limit result for the joint law of the areas and boundary lengths of the bounded complementary connected components of the FK loops on the infinite-volume planar map. In light of the encoding of Duplantier, Miller, and Sheffield (2014), the limiting object coincides with the joint law of the areas and boundary lengths of the bounded complementary connected components of a collection of CLE$_\kappa$ loops on an independent Liouville quantum gravity cone.",2

45030,0,"Obtaining Atomic Matrix Elements from Vector Tune-Out Wavelengths using Atom Interferometry Accurate values for atomic dipole matrix elements are useful in many areas of physics, and in particular for interpreting experiments such as atomic parity violation. Obtaining accurate matrix element values is a challenge for both experiment and theory. A new technique that can be applied to this problem is tune-out spectroscopy, which is the measurement of light wavelengths where the electric polarizability of an atom has a zero. Using atom interferometry methods, tune-out wavelengths can be measured very accurately. Their values depend on the ratios of various dipole matrix elements and are thus useful for constraining theory and broadening the application of experimental values. Tune-out wavelength measurements to date have focused on zeros of the scalar polarizability, but in general the vector polarizability also contributes. We show here that combined measurements of the vector and scalar polarizabilities can provide more detailed information about the matrix element ratios, and in particular can distinguish small contributions from the atomic core and the valence tail states. These small contributions are the leading error sources in current parity violation calculations for cesium.",2
45485,0,"On the role of Fourier modes in finite-size scaling above the upper critical dimension Renormalization-group theory stands, since over 40 years, as one of the pillars of modern physics. As such, there should be no remaining doubt regarding its validity. However, finite-size scaling, which derives from it, has long been poorly understood above the upper critical dimension $d_c$ in models with free boundary conditions. Besides its fundamental significance for scaling theories, the issue is important at a practical level because finite-size, statistical-physics systems, with free boundaries above $d_c$, are experimentally accessible with long-range interactions. Here we address the roles played by Fourier modes for such systems and show that the current phenomenological picture is not supported for all thermodynamic observables either with free or periodic boundaries. Instead, the correct picture emerges from a sector of the renormalization group hitherto considered unphysical.",2
46608,0,"Discrepancy of line segments for general lattice checkerboards In a series of papers recently ""checkerboard discrepancy"" has been introduced, where a black-and-white checkerboard background induces a coloring on any curve, and thus a discrepancy, i.e., the difference of the length of the curve colored white and the length colored black. Mainly straight lines and circles have been studied and the general situation is that, no matter what the background coloring, there is always a curve in the family studied whose discrepancy is at least of the order of the square root of the length of the curve. In this paper we generalize the shape of the background, keeping the lattice structure. Our background now consists of lattice copies of any bounded fundamental domain of the lattice, and not necessarily of squares, as was the case in the previous papers. As the decay properties of the Fourier Transform of the indicator function of the square were strongly used before, we now have to use a quite different proof, in which the tiling and spectral properties of the fundamental domain play a role.",2

Specifically we show that random graphs in which expected degree and clustering of every node are fixed to some constants are equivalent to random geometric graphs on the real line, if clustering is sufficiently strong. Large numbers of triangles, homogeneously distributed across all nodes as in real networks, are thus a consequence of network geometricity.

Introducing interfaces to the system one by one shows how those cutoff terms emerge and illuminates their physical interpretations. Based on that, we propose a subtraction scheme to address the problem of the remaining cutoff dependence in the Casimir stress in an inhomogeneous medium, and show that the nontouching Casimir force between two separated bodies is cutoff independent.

We show that for electric dipoles this divergence can be avoided if one takes into account that physical dipoles consist of two opposite charges which are separated by a finite distance.

49357,0,"On magnetic monopoles, the anomalous g-factor of the electron and the spin-orbit coupling in the Dirac theory We discuss the algebra and the interpretation of the anomalous Zeeman effect and the spin-orbit coupling within the Dirac theory. Whereas the algebra for the anomalous Zeeman effect is impeccable and therefore in excellent agreement with experiment, the physical interpretation of that algebra uses images that are based on macroscopic intuition but do not correspond to the meaning of this algebra. The interpretation violates the Lorentz symmetry. We give an alternative intuitive description of the meaning of this effect, which respects the symmetry and is exact. It can be summarized by stating that a magnetic field makes any charged particle spin. We show also that the traditional discussion about magnetic monopoles confuses two issues, viz. the symmetry of the Maxwell equations and the quantization of charge. These two issues define each a different concept of magnetic monopole. They cannot be merged together into a unique all-encompassing issue. We also generalize the minimal substitution for a charged particle, and provide some intuition for the magnetic vector potential. We finally explore the algebra of the spin-orbit coupling, which turns out to be badly wrong. The traditional theory that is claimed to reproduce the Thomas half is based on a number of errors. An error-free application of the Dirac theory cannot account for the Thomas precession, because it only accounts for the instantaneous local boosts, not for the rotational component of the Lorentz transformation. This runs contrary to established beliefs, but Thomas precession can be understood in terms of the Berry phase on a path through the velocity space of the Lorentz group manifold. These results clearly reveal the limitations of the prevailing working philosophy to ""shut up and calculate"".",2
49783,0,"The Representation Theory of Dynkin Quivers. Three Contributions These notes provide three contributions to the (well-established) representation theory of Dynkin and Euclidean quivers. They should be helpful as part of a direct approach to study representations of quivers, and they may shed some new light on properties of Dynkin and Euclidean quivers. Part 1 deals with the case A (see arXiv:1304.5720). Part 2 concerns the case D. We show that the category of representation of D_n contains a full subcategory which is equivalent to the category of representations of a quiver of type D_{n-1} such that the remaining indecomposable representations are thin. This suggests an inductive procedure to deal with the D-cases, starting with D_3 = A_3. Part 3 deals with the cases E. It provides a uniform way to construct the maximal indecomposable representation for these Dynkin quivers as well as a unified method to deal with the corresponding Euclidean quivers. The level of the presentation varies considerably and increases throughout the discussion. Whereas Part 1 is completely elementary, just based on some results in linear algebra, the further text is less self-contained and uses one-point extensions, simplification, perpendicular categories, Auslander-Reiten quivers and hammocks.",2
50666,0,"On angular momentum of photons: the role of transversality condition in quantum mechanics Whether the total angular momentum of the photon can be separated into spin and orbital parts has been a long-standing problem due to the constraint of transversality condition on its vector wavefunction. A careful analysis shows that the situation arises from a misuse of the constraint in quantum mechanics. To use the constraint properly, we convert the vector representation into a two-component representation in which the wavefunction is not constrained by any conditions. Upon doing so, we not only separate the spin conceptually from the orbital angular momentum but also identify the Berry gauge in which the two-component wavefunction can be canonically quantized. A corollary is that only in one particular Berry gauge can a radiation field be canonically quantized in terms of the plane waves. The degree of freedom to fix the Berry gauge, which reflects a symmetry of the constraint, turns out to have observable quantum effects.",2
50774,0,"Bipartite quantum coherence in noninertial frames Quantum coherence as the fundamental characteristic of quantum physics, provides the valuable resource for quantum computation in exceeding the power of classical algorithms. The exploration of quantum coherence in relativistic systems is of significance from both the fundamental points of view and practical applications. We investigate the quantum coherence of two free modes of scalar and Dirac fields as detected by two relatively accelerated observers by resorting to the relative entropy of coherence. We show that the relative entropy of coherence monotonically decreases when acceleration goes up, as a consequence of the Unruh effect. Specifically, the initial states with parameters $\alpha=b$ and $\alpha=\sqrt{1-b^2}$ have the same initial relative entropy coherence at $a=0$ (with $a$ the acceleration), but degrade along two different trajectories. The relative entropy of coherence reaches vanishing value in the scalar field in the infinite acceleration limit, but non-vanishing value in the Dirac field. This suggests that in the Dirac field, the bipartite state possesses quantum coherence to some extent with the variation of the relative acceleration, and may lead to potential applications in quantum computation performed by observers in motion relatively.",2
50957,0,"Families of spherical caps: spectra and ray limit We consider a family of surfaces of revolution ranging between a disc and a hemisphere, that is spherical caps. For this family, we study the spectral density in the ray limit and arrive at a trace formula with geodesic polygons describing the spectral fluctuations. When the caps approach the hemisphere the spectrum becomes equally spaced and highly degenerate whereas the derived trace formula breaks down. We discuss its divergence and also derive a different trace formula for this hemispherical case. We next turn to perturbative corrections in the wave number where the work in the literature is done for either flat domains or curved without boundaries. In the present case, we calculate the leading correction explicitly and incorporate it into the semiclassical expression for the fluctuating part of the spectral density. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first calculation of such perturbative corrections in the case of curvature and boundary.",2

We generalise previous formulations of the IIA to handle non-smooth processes, and derive a closed form expression for the FPTD in Laplace and $z$-transform space for arbitrary boundary and starting points in one dimension. We focus on Markov processes for which the IIA is exact. To apply our equations, we calculate the FPTD in two cases: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the discrete time Brownian walk.

51966,0,"Towards an experimental realization of affinely transformed linearized QED vacuum via inverse homogenization Within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED), vacuum is a nonlinear medium which can be linearized for a rapidly time-varying electromagnetic field with a small amplitude subjected to a magnetostatic field. The linearized QED vacuum is a uniaxial dielectric-magnetic medium for which the degree of anisotropy is exceedingly small. By implementing an affine transformation of the spatial coordinates, the degree of anisotropy may become sufficiently large as to be readily perceivable. The inverse Bruggeman formalism can be implemented to specify a homogenized composite material (HCM) which is electromagnetically equivalent to the affinely transformed QED vacuum. This HCM can arise from remarkably simple component materials; for example, two isotropic dielectric materials and two isotropic magnetic materials, randomly distributed as oriented spheroidal particles.",2

This universal uncertainty relation is tight at least for the cases $k=2n$ and $k=3$. For two observables, the uncertainty relation is exactly a simpler reformulation of Schr\""odinger's uncertainty principle.",2
57251,0,"Duality symmetries behind solutions of the classical simple pendulum The solutions that describe the motion of the classical simple pendulum have been known for very long time and are given in terms of elliptic functions, which are doubly periodic functions in the complex plane. The independent variable of the solutions is time and it can be considered either as a real variable or as a purely imaginary one, which introduces a rich symmetry structure in the space of solutions. When solutions are written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions the symmetry is codified in the functional form of its modulus, and is described mathematically by the six dimensional coset group $\Gamma/\Gamma(2)$ where $\Gamma$ is the modular group and $\Gamma(2)$ is its congruence subgroup of second level. In this paper we discuss the physical consequences this symmetry has on the pendulum motions and it is argued they have similar properties to the ones termed as duality symmetries in other areas of physics, such as field theory and string theory. In particular a single solution of pure imaginary time for all allowed value of the total mechanical energy is given and obtained as the $S$-dual of a single solution of real time, where $S$ stands for the $S$ generator of the modular group.",2

Starting from a variational principle, we derive local equations of motion, that is, differential equations that determine classical surfaces and momenta. A local Hamilton-Jacobi equation applicable in the field theory then follows readily.

From this result we additionally get the expected number of eigenvalues outside the droplet. We also obtain the asymptotics of the kernel and found that, in the bulk, the correction term is exponentially small. This leads to the vanishing of certain Cauchy transform of the orthogonal polynomial in the bulk of the droplet up to an exponentially small error.",2

We compare euclidean PGA and the popular 2-up model CGA (conformal geometric algebra), restricting attention to flat geometric primitives, and show that on this domain they exhibit the same formal feature set. We thereby establish that euclidean PGA is the smallest structure-preserving euclidean GA. We compare the two algebras in more detail, with respect to a number of practical criteria, including implementation of kinematics and rigid body mechanics. We then extend the comparison to include euclidean sphere primitives. We conclude that euclidean PGA provides a natural transition, both scientifically and pedagogically, between vector space models and the more complex and powerful CGA.",2

65718,0,"Correlation functions in conformal invariant stochastic processes We consider the problem of correlation functions in the stationary states of one-dimensional stochastic models having conformal invariance. If one considers the space dependence of the correlators, the novel aspect is that although one considers systems with periodic boundary conditions, the observables are described by boundary operators. From our experience with equilibrium problems one would have expected bulk operators. Boundary operators have correlators having critical exponents being half of those of bulk operators. If one studies the space-time dependence of the two-point function, one has to consider one boundary and one bulk operators. The Raise and Peel model has conformal invariance as can be shown in the spin 1/2 basis of the Hamiltonian which gives the time evolution of the system. This is an XXZ quantum chain with twisted boundary condition and local interactions. This Hamiltonian is integrable and the spectrum is known in the finite-size scaling limit. In the stochastic base in which the process is defined, the Hamiltonian is not local anymore. The mapping into an SOS model, helps to define new local operators. As a byproduct some new properties of the SOS model are conjectured. The predictions of conformal invariance are discussed in the new framework and compared with Monte Carlo simulations.",2

Our results indicate that the standard interpretation of a bare atom surrounded by a localised virtual photon cloud, is difficult to sustain, because the radiated energy-flux surviving infinitely far from the source contains virtual contributions. It follows that there is a clear distinction to be made between a radiative photon defined in terms of the radiation fields, and a real photon, whose identification depends on whether or not a given process conserves the free energy. This free energy is represented by the difference between the total dipole-field Hamiltonian and its interaction component.",2

For this purpose we use a cointegration analysis with one structural break to capture the crisis effect, and we assess the inflation uncertainty based on a time-varying unobserved component model. In line with recent empirical studies we discover that in the long-run, the inflation and its uncertainty negatively impact the stock prices, opposed to the well-known Fisher effect. In addition we show that for several sector stock indexes the negative effect of inflation and its uncertainty vanishes after the crisis setup. However, in the short-run the results provide evidence in the favor of a negative impact of uncertainty, while the inflation has no significant influence on stock prices, except for the consumption indexes. The consideration of business cycle effects confirms our findings, which proves that the results are robust, both for the long-and the short-run relationships.",2

Hirzebruch's original $\chi_y$-genus can be extended towards two directions: the pluri-case and the case of elliptic genus. This paper contains two parts in which we investigate the -1-phenomena in these two generalized cases respectively and show that in each case there exists a -1-phenomenon in a suitable sense. Our main results in the first part have an application, which states that all characteristic numbers (Chern numbers and Pontrjagin numbers) on manifolds can be expressed, in a very explicit way, in terms of some rationally linear combination of indices of some elliptic operators. This gives an analytic interpretation of characteristic numbers and affirmatively answers a question posed by the author several years ago. The second part contains our attempt to generalize this -1-phenomenon to elliptic genus, a modern version of the $\chi_y$-genus. We first extend the elliptic genus of an almost-complex manifold to a twisted version where an extra complex vector bundle is involved, and show that it is a weak Jacobi form under some assumptions. A suitable manipulation on the theory of Jacobi form will produce new modular forms from this weak Jacobi form and thus much arithmetic information related to the underlying manifold can be obtained, in which the -1-phenomenon of the original $\chi_y$-genus is hidden.",2

After showing that the DR hierarchy satisfies tau-symmetry we define its partition function as the (logarithm of the) tau-function of the string solution and show that it satisfies various properties (string, dilaton and divisor equations plus some important degree constraints). We then formulate a stronger version of the conjecture from [Bur15]: for any semisimple cohomological field theory, the Dubrovin-Zhang and double ramification hierarchies are related by a normal (i.e. preserving the tau-structure [DLYZ14]) Miura transformation which we completely identify in terms of the partition function of the CohFT. In fact, using only the partition functions, the conjecture can be formulated even in the non-semisimple case (where the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy is not defined). We then prove this conjecture for various CohFTs (trivial CohFT, Hodge class, Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathbb{CP}^1$, $3$-, $4$- and $5$-spin classes) and in genus $1$ for any semisimple CohFT.

73172,0,"Modelling, Measuring and Compensating Color Weak Vision We use methods from Riemann geometry to investigate transformations between the color spaces of color-normal and color weak observers. The two main applications are the simulation of the perception of a color weak observer for a color normal observer and the compensation of color images in a way that a color weak observer has approximately the same perception as a color normal observer. The metrics in the color spaces of interest are characterized with the help of ellipsoids defined by the just-noticable-differences between color which are measured with the help of color-matching experiments. The constructed mappings are isometries of Riemann spaces that preserve the perceived color-differences for both observers. Among the two approaches to build such an isometry, we introduce normal coordinates in Riemann spaces as a tool to construct a global color-weak compensation map. Compared to previously used methods this method is free from approximation errors due to local linearizations and it avoids the problem of shifting locations of the origin of the local coordinate system.

We study the transport properties across such a transition, from a Dirac semi-metal through a semi-Dirac phase towards a gapped phase. Using both a Boltzmann approach and a diagrammatic Kubo approach, we describe the conductivity tensor within the diffusive regime. In particular, we show that both the anisotropy of the Fermi surface and the Dirac nature of the eigenstates combine to give rise to anisotropic transport times, manifesting themselves through an unusual matrix self-energy.",2

Lev Vaidman has suggested that local interactions of gauge-invariant quantities, e.g. magnetic torques, suffice for the description of all quantum electromagnetic phenomena. We analyze six thought experiments that challenge this suggestion. All of them have explanations in terms of $local$ interactions of gauge-dependent quantities, in addition, some have explanations in terms of nonlocal interactions of gauge-invariant quantities. We claim, however, that two of our examples have no gauge-invariant formal description and that, in general, no local description can dispense with electromagnetic potentials.",2

Our main tools are the direct and inverse scattering transforms for doubly-infinite Jacobi matrices, which are well-known to linearize the Toda flow. We focus in particular on the evolution of the associated scattering data under the perturbed vs. the unperturbed equations. We find that the eigenvalues present initially in the scattering data converge to new, slightly perturbed eigenvalues under the perturbed dynamics of the lattice equation. To these eigenvalues correspond solitary waves that emerge from the solitons in the initial data. We also find that new eigenvalues emerge from the continuous spectrum as the lattice system is let to evolve under the perturbed dynamics.",2

When no symmetry is present, a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued invariant can be defined in each gap in all even space dimensions. This invariant does not capture all the properties of a system where chiral symmetry is present. In even space dimension, chiral symmetry puts constraints on its values in different gaps.

86755,0,"Are Local Causal Models of Quantum Theory Feasible at All? This article presents an analysis of the extent to which local causal models or local realistic models of quantum theory (QT), including quantum field theory (QFT), are theoretically possible and practically feasible in light of the present state of these theories. Quantum physicists consider Bells famous inequality and its violation in experiments to be a strong indication that local realistic or local causal models of QT are not possible and that quantum theory as a whole is therefore not a local realistic or local causal theory. Based on a proposed definition of a ""formal causal model"" for a theory of physics (such as QT), this paper investigates the possibility of having a local causal model for QT. Areas of QT are identified in which the construction of a causal model is impeded because of deficiencies in the state of the respective theory. It is shown that the removal of the deficiencies can be achieved by the provision of a causal model. Whereas the construction of a causal model of QT, including QFT, appears to be feasible after the removal of certain deficiencies, the construction of a local (causal) model does not appear to be possible. As a consequence of the conclusion that local (causal) models of QT/QFT are not possible, if a strong interpretation of locality is assumed, a locality model is proposed in which the non-localities are confined to ""quantum objects"".",2
87498,0,"Thermal Excitations of Warped Membranes We explore thermal fluctuations of thin planar membranes with a frozen spatially-varying background metric and a shear modulus. We focus on a special class of $D$-dimensional ``warped membranes'' embedded in a $d-$dimensional space with $d\ge D+1$ and a preferred height profile characterized by quenched random Gaussian variables $\{h_\alpha({\bf q})\}$, $\alpha=D+1,\ldots, d$, in Fourier space with zero mean and a power law variance $\overline{ h_\alpha({\bf q}_1) h_\beta({\bf q}_2) } \sim \delta_{\alpha, \beta} \, \delta_{{\bf q}_1, -{\bf q}_2} \, q_1^{-d_h}$. The case $D=2$, $d=3$ with $d_h = 4$ could be realized by flash polymerizing lyotropic smectic liquid crystals. For $D &lt; \max\{4, d_h\}$ the elastic constants are non-trivially renormalized and become scale dependent. Via a self consistent screening approximation we find that the renormalized bending rigidity increases for small wavevectors ${{\bf q}}$ as $\kappa_R \sim q^{-\eta_f}$, while the in-hyperplane elastic constants decrease according to $\lambda_R,\ \mu_R \sim q^{+\eta_u}$. The quenched background metric is relevant (irelevant) for warped membranes characterized by exponent $d_h &gt; 4 - \eta_f^{(F)}$ ($d_h &lt; 4 - \eta_f^{(F)}$), where $\eta_f^{(F)}$ is the scaling exponent for tethered surfaces with a flat background metric, and the scaling exponents are related through $\eta_u + \eta_f = d_h - D$ ($\eta_u + 2 \eta_f=4-D$).",2

It is found that the majority of v2 comes from the anisotropic escape probability of partons, with no fundamental difference at low and high transverse momenta.

Our findings challenge the current paradigm emerged from hydrodynamic comparisons to anisotropy data.",2
88650,0,"The mother body phase transition in the normal matrix model The normal matrix model with algebraic potential has gained a lot of attention recently, partially in virtue of its connection to several other topics as quadrature domains, inverse potential problems and the Laplacian growth. In this paper we consider the normal matrix model with cubic plus linear potential. To regularize the model, we follow Elbau &amp; Felder and introduce a cut-off. In the large size limit, the eigenvalues of the model accumulate uniformly within a certain domain $\Omega$ that we determine explicitly by finding the rational parametrization of its boundary. We also study in details the mother body problem associated to $\Omega$. It turns out that the mother body measure $\mu_*$ displays a novel phase transition that we call the mother body phase transition: although $\partial \Omega$ evolves analytically, the mother body measure undergoes a ""one-cut to three-cut"" phase transition. To construct the mother body measure, we define a quadratic differential $\varpi$ on the associated spectral curve, and embed $\mu_*$ into its critical graph. Using deformation techniques for quadratic differentials, we are able to get precise information on $\mu_*$. In particular, this allows us to determine the phase diagram for the mother body phase transition explicitly. Following previous works of Bleher &amp; Kuijlaars and Kuijlaars &amp; L\'opez, we consider multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the model. Applying the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method to the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem, we obtain asymptotic formulas for these polynomials. Due to the presence of the linear term in the potential, there are no rotational symmetries in the model. This makes the construction of the associated $g$-functions significantly more involved, and the critical graph of $\varpi$ becomes the key technical tool in this analysis as well.",2

Using this encoding together with the mating-of-trees construction of Liouville quantum gravity due to Duplantier, Miller, and Sheffield (2014), they proved that random bipolar-oriented planar maps converge in the scaling limit to a $\sqrt{4/3}$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface decorated by an independent SLE$_{12}$ in the peanosphere sense, meaning that the height functions of a particular pair of trees on the maps converge in the scaling limit to the correlated planar Brownian motion which encodes the SLE-decorated LQG surface. We improve this convergence result by proving that the pair of height functions for an infinite-volume random bipolar-oriented triangulation and the pair of height functions for its dual map converge jointly in law in the scaling limit to the two planar Brownian motions which encode the same $\sqrt{4/3}$-LQG surface decorated by both an SLE$_{12}$ curve and the ""dual"" SLE$_{12}$ curve which travels in a direction perpendicular (in the sense of imaginary geometry) to the original curve. This confirms a conjecture of Kenyon, Miller, Sheffield, and Wilson (2015).",2

However, if this model is naively used to analyze the electromagnetic response within a linear response theory, it gives the result apparently inconsistent with the persuasive prediction based on a lattice model. We show that this serious difficulty is related to the breaking of current conservation in the Dirac model due to quantum anomaly and can be removed if current and charge operators are redefined to include the contribution from the anomaly. We demonstrate that the CME as well as the AHE can be properly described using newly defined operators, and clarify that the CME is determined by the competition between the contribution from the anomaly and that from low-energy electrons.",2
94046,0,"Photon reflection by a quantum mirror: a wave function approach We derive from first principles the momentum exchange between a photon and a quantum mirror upon reflection, by considering the boundary conditions imposed by the mirror surface on the photon wave equation. We show that the system generally ends up in an entangled state, unless the mirror position uncertainty is much smaller than the photon wavelength, when the mirror behaves classically. Our treatment leads us directly to the conclusion that the photon momentum has the known value hk/2{\pi}. This implies that when the mirror is immersed in a dielectric medium the photon radiation pressure is proportional to the medium refractive index n. Our work thus contributes to the longstanding Abraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in a medium. We interpret the result by associating the Minkowski momentum (which is proportional to n) with the canonical momentum of light, which appears naturally in quantum formulations.",2

As a result, we can understand the condition as consequences of physically natural state preparations in vacuum backgrounds. Furthermore, a theory of orthogonal decomposition of completely positive (CP) maps is developed. It unifies a theory of orthogonal decomposition of states and order structure theory of CP maps. By using it, localized version of sectors is formulated, which gives sector theory for local states with respect to general reference representations.",2

In the case of a normal crossings divisor, the Rota-Baxter structure simplifies considerably and the factorization becomes a simple pole subtraction. We apply this formalism to the unrenormalized momentum space Feynman amplitudes, viewed as (divergent) integrals in the complement of the determinant hypersurface. We lift the integral to the Kausz compactification of the general linear group, whose boundary divisor is normal crossings. We show that the Kausz compactification is a Tate motive and that the boundary divisor and the divisor that contains the boundary of the chain of integration are mixed Tate configurations. The regularization of the integrals that we obtain differs from the usual renormalization of physical Feynman amplitudes, and in particular it may give mixed Tate periods in some cases that have non-mixed Tate contributions when computed with other renormalization methods.",2

The other observables of QM and their rates also become gauge-dependent unless a proper account for the gauge choice is done in their definition. We show the explicit effect of these non-uniqueness issues in the case of the Dirac equation in a general spacetime with the Schwinger gauge.

96424,0,"Correlation functions, universal ratios and Goldstone mode singularities in n-vector models Correlation functions in the O(n) models below the critical temperature are considered. Based on Monte Carlo (MC) data, we confirm the fact stated earlier by Engels and Vogt, that the transverse two-plane correlation function of the O(4) model for lattice sizes about L=120 and small external fields h is very well described by a Gaussian approximation. However, we show that fits of not lower quality are provided by certain non-Gaussian approximation. We have also tested larger lattice sizes, up to L=512. The Fourier-transformed transverse and longitudinal two-point correlation functions have Goldstone mode singularities in the thermodynamic limit at k --&gt; 0 and h=+0, i.e., G_perp(k) = a k^{-lambda_perp} and G_parallel(k) = b k^{-lambda_parallel}, respectively. Here a and b are the amplitudes, k is the magnitude of the wave vector. The exponents lambda_perp, lambda_parallel and the ratio b M^2/a^2, where M is the spontaneous magnetization, are universal according to the GFD (grouping of Feynman diagrams) approach. Here we find that the universality follows also from the standard (Gaussian) theory, yielding b M^2/a^2 = (n-1)/16. Our MC estimates of this ratio are 0.06 +/- 0.01 for n=2, 0.17 +/- 0.01 for n=4 and 0.498 +/- 0.010 for n=10. According to these and our earlier MC results, the asymptotic behavior and Goldstone mode singularities are not exactly described by the standard theory. This is expected from the GFD theory.

96550,0,"A multiple--resolution strategy for Direct Numerical Simulation of scalar turbulence In this paper a numerical procedure to simulate low diffusivity scalar turbulence is presented. The method consists of using a grid for the advected scalar with a higher spatial resolutions than that of the momentum. The latter usually requires a less refined mesh and integrating both fields on a single grid tailored to the most demanding variable, produces an unnecessary computational overhead. A multiple resolution approach is used also in the time integration in order to maintain the stability of the scalars on the finer grid. The method is the more advantageous the less diffusive the scalar is with respect to momentum, therefore it is particularly well suited for large Prandtl or Schmidt number flows. However, even in the case of equal diffusivities the present procedure gives CPU time and memory occupation savings. The reason is that the absence of the pressure term in the scalar equation leads to much steeper gradients in the scalar field as compared to the velocity field.",2

This model includes the four standard quantum optics model as its various special limits. The $ 1/J $ expansions is complementary to the strong coupling expansion used by the authors in arXiv:1512.08581 to study the same model in its dual $ Z_2/U(1) $ representation. We identify 3 regimes of the system's energy levels: the normal, $ U(1) $ and quantum tunneling (QT) regime. The system's energy levels are grouped into doublets which consist of scattering states and Schrodinger Cats with even ( e ) and odd ( o ) parities in the $ U(1) $ and quantum tunneling (QT) regime respectively. In the QT regime, by the WKB method, we find the emergencies of bound states one by one as the interaction strength increases, then investigate a new class of quantum tunneling processes through the instantons between the two bound states in the compact photon phase. It is the Berry phase interference effects in the instanton tunneling event which leads to Schrodinger Cats oscillating with even and odd parities in both ground and higher energy bound states. We map out the energy level evolution from the $ U(1) $ to the QT regime and also discuss some duality relations between the energy levels in the two regimes. We also compute the photon correlation functions, squeezing spectrum, number correlation functions in both regimes which can be measured by various experimental techniques. The combinations of the results achieved here by $ 1/J $ expansion and those in arXiv:1512.08581 by strong coupling method lead to rather complete understandings of the $ U(1)/Z_2 $ Dicke model at a finite $ N $ and any anisotropy parameter $ \beta $.",2

On the geometric side, an aperiodic inflation system possesses a set of exact renormalisation relations for its pair correlation coefficients.

Here, we overcome this difficulty by using the replica method, a tool borrowed from statistical physics and quantum field theory. We exhibit a first application of this method to the field of quantum optics, where it enables accessing entropies in a two-mode squeezer or optical parametric amplifier.

111374,0,"Efficient implementation of the parquet equations -- role of the reducible vertex function and its kernel approximation We present an efficient implementation of the parquet formalism which respects the asymptotic structure of the vertex functions at both single- and two-particle levels in momentum- and frequency-space. We identify the two-particle reducible vertex as the core function which is essential for the construction of the other vertex functions. This observation stimulates us to consider a two-level parameter-reduction for this function to simplify the solution of the parquet equations. The resulting functions, which depend on fewer arguments, are coined ""kernel functions"". With the use of the ""kernel functions"", the open boundary of various vertex functions in the Matsubara-frequency space can be faithfully satisfied. We justify our implementation by accurately reproducing the dynamical mean-field theory results from momentum-independent parquet calculations. The high-frequency asymptotics of the single-particle self-energy and the two-particle vertex are correctly reproduced, which turns out to be essential for the self-consistent determination of the parquet solutions. The current implementation is also feasible for the dynamical vertex approximation.",2

The mixed representation allows us to use the momentum around the circumference as a conserved quantity in the DMRG algorithm. Compared with the traditional purely real-space approach, we find a significant speedup in computation time and a considerable reduction in memory usage. Applying the method to the interacting fermionic Hofstadter model, we demonstrate a reduction in computation time by over 20-fold, in addition to a sixfold memory reduction.",2

112245,0,"Towards Quantized Number Theory: Spectral Operators and an Asymmetric Criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis This research expository article contains a survey of earlier work (in \S2--\S4) but also contains a main new result (in \S5), which we first describe. Given $c \geq 0$, the spectral operator $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{a}_c$ can be thought of intuitively as the operator which sends the geometry onto the spectrum of a fractal string of dimension not exceeding $c$. Rigorously, it turns out to coincide with a suitable quantization of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta = \zeta(s)$: $\mathfrak{a} = \zeta (\partial)$, where $\partial = \partial_c$ is the infinitesimal shift of the real line acting on the weighted Hilbert space $L^2 (\mathbb{R}, e^{-2ct} dt)$. In this paper, we establish a new asymmetric criterion for the Riemann hypothesis, expressed in terms of the invertibility of the spectral operator for all values of the dimension parameter $c \in (0, 1/2)$ (i.e., for all $c$ in the left half of the critical interval $(0,1)$). This corresponds (conditionally) to a mathematical (and perhaps also, physical) ""phase transition"" occurring in the midfractal case when $c= 1/2$. Both the universality and the non-universality of $\zeta = \zeta (s)$ in the right (resp., left) critical strip $\{1/2 &lt; \text{Re}(s) &lt; 1 \}$ (resp., $\{0 &lt; \text{Re}(s) &lt; 1/2 \}$) play a key role in this context. These new results are presented in \S5. In \S2, we briefly discuss earlier joint work on the complex dimensions of fractal strings, while in \S3 and \S4, we survey earlier related work of the author with H. Maier and with H. Herichi, respectively, in which were established symmetric criteria for the Riemann hypothesis, expressed respectively in terms of a family of natural inverse spectral problems for fractal strings of Minkowski dimension $D \in (0,1),$ with $D \neq 1/2$, and of the quasi-invertibility of the family of spectral operators $\mathfrak{a}_c$ (with $c \in (0,1), c \neq 1/2$).",2

At least in the case of the step initial condition, our formulas degenerate in appropriate limits to many known formulas of such type for integrable probabilistic systems in the (1+1)d KPZ universality class, including the stochastic six vertex model, ASEP, various q-TASEPs, and associated zero range processes. Our arguments are largely based on properties of a family of symmetric rational functions which can be defined as partition functions of the inhomogeneous higher spin six vertex model for suitable domains. In the homogeneous case, such functions were previously studied in http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0976; they also generalize classical Hall-Littlewood and Schur polynomials.

We show that the average density has a finite support with an edge, and near this edge the density exhibits a universal (valid for a wide class of potentials) scaling behavior for large $N$. The associated edge scaling function is computed exactly and generalizes to any $d$ the edge electron gas result of Kohn and Mattsson in $d=3$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 3487 (1998)]. In addition, we calculate the kernel (that characterizes any $n$-point correlation function) for large $N$ and show that, when appropriately scaled, it depends only on dimension $d$, but has otherwise universal scaling forms, at the edges. The edge kernel, for higher $d$, generalizes the Airy kernel in one dimension, well known from random matrix theory.",2

118571,0,"Directed random polymers via nested contour integrals We study the partition function of two versions of the continuum directed polymer in 1+1 dimension. In the full-space version, the polymer starts at the origin and is free to move transversally in the reals, and in the half-space version, the polymer starts at the origin but is reflected at the origin and stays in the negative reals. The partition functions solves the stochastic heat equation in full-space or half-space with mixed boundary condition at the origin; or equivalently the free energy satisfies the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. We derive exact formulas for the Laplace transforms of the partition functions. In the full-space this is expressed as a Fredholm determinant while in the half-space this is expressed as a Fredholm Pfaffian. Taking long-time asymptotics we show that the limiting free energy fluctuations scale with exponent 1/3 and are given by the GUE and GSE Tracy-Widom distributions. These formulas come from summing divergent moment generating functions, hence are not mathematically justified. The primary purpose of this work is to present a mathematical perspective on the polymer replica method which is used to derive these results. In contrast to other replica method work, we do not appeal directly to the Bethe ansatz for the Lieb-Liniger model but rather utilize nested contour integral formulas for moments as well as their residue expansions.",2

Using a bound from the holographic principle and treating the universe as the ultimate quantum computer, we show that if we want to reverse the dynamics of an object which has evolved since the beginning of time, its radius cannot exceed ten microns.

A new family of $2D$ walks is introduced and its continuous limit is shown to coincide with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic interpretation is extended beyond the continuous limit by proving that these DTQWs exhibit an exact discrete local $U(1)$ gauge invariance and possess a discrete gauge-invariant conserved current. A discrete gauge-invariant electromagnetic field is also constructed and that field is coupled to the conserved current by a discrete generalization of Maxwell equations. The dynamics of the DTQWs under crossed electric and magnetic fields is finally explored outside the continuous limit by numerical simulations.

We explore the $(x,z)$ phase diagram for some values of $n$. For $01$, the O($n$)-like transition line appears to be absent. Thus, for $z=0$, the $(n,x)$ phase diagram displays a line of phase transitions for $n\le 1$. The line ends at $n=1$ in an infinite-order transition. We determine the conformal anomaly and the critical exponents along this line. These results agree accurately with a recent proposal for the universal classification of this type of model, at least in most of the range $-1 \leq n \leq 1$.

We utilise scanning electron diffraction to perform Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) on Ion Beam Sputtered (IBS) amorphous tantala coatings, definitively showing an increase in the medium range order (MRO), as determined from the variance between the diffraction patterns in the scan, due to thermal annealing at increasing temperatures. Moreover, we employ Virtual Dark-Field Imaging (VDFi) to spatially resolve the FEM signal, enabling investigation of the persistence of the fragments responsible for the medium range order, as well as the extent of the ordering over nm length scales, and show ordered patches larger than 5 nm in the highest temperature annealed sample. These structural changes directly correlate with the observed changes in mechanical loss.",2
133255,0,"Entanglement Holographic Mapping of Many-Body Localized System by Spectrum Bifurcation Renormalization Group We introduce the spectrum bifurcation renormalization group (SBRG) as a generalization of the real-space renormalization group for the many-body localized (MBL) system without truncating the Hilbert space. Starting from a disordered many-body Hamiltonian in the full MBL phase, the SBRG flows to the MBL fixed-point Hamiltonian, and generates the local conserved quantities and the matrix product state representations for all eigenstates. The method is applicable to both spin and fermion models with arbitrary interaction strength on any lattice in all dimensions, as long as the models are in the MBL phase. In particular, we focus on the $1d$ interacting Majorana chain with strong disorder, and map out its phase diagram using the entanglement entropy. The SBRG flow also generates an entanglement holographic mapping, which duals the MBL state to a fragmented holographic space decorated with small blackholes.",2
133699,0,"Spectral correlation functions of the sum of two independent complex Wishart matrices with unequal covariances We compute the spectral statistics of the sum H of two independent complex Wishart matrices, each of which is correlated with a different covariance matrix. Random matrix theory enjoys many applications including sums and products of random matrices. Typically ensembles with correlations among the matrix elements are much more difficult to solve. Using a combination of supersymmetry, superbosonisation and bi-orthogonal functions we are able to determine all spectral k-point density correlation functions of H for arbitrary matrix size N. In the half-degenerate case, when one of the covariance matrices is proportional to the identity, the recent results by Kumar for the joint eigenvalue distribution of H serve as our starting point. In this case the ensemble has a bi-orthogonal structure and we explicitly determine its kernel, providing its exact solution for finite N. The kernel follows from computing the expectation value of a single characteristic polynomial. In the general non-degenerate case the generating function for the k-point resolvent is determined from a supersymmetric evaluation of the expectation value of k ratios of characteristic polynomials. Numerical simulations illustrate our findings for the spectral density at finite N and we also give indications how to do the asymptotic large-N analysis.",2

134995,0,"A noncommutative model for higher twisted K-Theory We develop a operator algebraic model for twisted $K$-theory, which includes the most general twistings as a generalized cohomology theory (i.e. all those classified by the unit spectrum $bgl_1(KU)$). Our model is based on strongly self-absorbing $C^*$-algebras. We compare it with the known homotopy theoretic descriptions in the literature, which either use parametrized stable homotopy theory or $\infty$-categories. We derive a similar comparison of analytic twisted $K$-homology with its topological counterpart based on generalized Thom spectra. Our model also works for twisted versions of localizations of the $K$-theory spectrum, like $KU[1/n]$ or $KU_{\mathbb{Q}}$.",2
135022,0,"Truncating an exact Matrix Product State for the XY model: transfer matrix and its renormalisation We discuss how to analytically obtain an -- essentially infinite -- Matrix Product State (MPS) representation of the ground state of the XY model. On the one hand this allows to illustrate how the Ornstein-Zernike form of the correlation function emerges in the exact case using standard MPS language. On the other hand we study the consequences of truncating the bond dimension of the exact MPS, which is also part of many tensor network algorithms, and analyze how the truncated MPS transfer matrix is representing the dominant part of the exact quantum transfer matrix. In the gapped phase we observe that the correlation length obtained from a truncated MPS approaches the exact value following a power law in effective bond dimension. In the gapless phase we find a good match between a state obtained numerically from standard MPS techniques with finite bond dimension, and a state obtained by effective finite imaginary time evolution in our framework. This provides a direct hint for a geometric interpretation of Finite Entanglement Scaling at the critical point in this case. Finally, by analyzing the spectra of transfer matrices, we support the interpretation put forward by [V. Zauner at. al., New J. Phys. 17, 053002 (2015)] that the MPS transfer matrix emerges from the quantum transfer matrix though the application of Wilson's Numerical Renormalisation Group along the imaginary-time direction.",2
135256,0,"Magnetic oscillations of the anomalous Hall conductivity It is known that the Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations can be observed in the Hall resistivity, although their amplitude is much weaker than the amplitude of the diagonal resistivity oscillations. Employing a model of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations of the anomalous Hall conductivity is the same as that of the diagonal conductivity. We argue that the oscillations of the anomalous Hall conductivity can be observed by studying the valley Hall effect in graphene superlattices and the spin Hall effect in the low-buckled Dirac materials.",2
