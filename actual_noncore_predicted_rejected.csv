90,1,"Surrogate-based artifact removal from single-channel EEG The recent emergence and success of electroencephalography (EEG) in low-cost portable devices, has opened the door to a new generation of applications processing a small number of EEG channels for health monitoring and brain-computer interfacing. These recordings are, however, contaminated by many sources of noise degrading the signals of interest, thus compromising the interpretation of the underlying brain state. In this work, we propose a new data-driven algorithm to effectively remove ocular and muscular artifacts from single-channel EEG: the surrogate-based artifact removal (SuBAR). Methods: By means of the time-frequency analysis of surrogate data, our approach is able to identify and filter automatically ocular and muscular artifacts embedded in single-channel EEG. Results: In a comparative study using artificially contami- nated EEG signals, the efficacy of the algorithm in terms of noise removal and signal distortion was superior to other traditionally-employed single-channel EEG denoising techniques: wavelet thresholding and the canonical correlation analysis combined with an advanced version of the empirical mode decomposition. Even in the presence of mild and severe artifacts, our artifact removal method provides a relative error 4 to 5 times lower than traditional techniques. Significance: In view of these results, the SuBAR method is a promising solution for mobile environments, such as ambulatory healthcare systems, sleep stage scoring or anesthesia monitoring, where very few EEG channels or even a single channel is available.",0
264,1,"Correlation between photoemissive and morphological properties of KBr thin film photocathodes In the present work, the morphological properties of KBr photocathodes are correlated with their photoemissive behaviour using a combination of analyzing techniques including SEM, TEM and AFM. From morphological studies, it is observed that KBr films have granular characteristics with varied average grain size and grain density. Structure and orientation of individual grains have been investigated by selected area electron diffraction technique and found to be the crystalline in nature with a face centered cubic structure. It is evident from the AFM analysis that the root mean square roughness and maximum area peak height have been decreased with the deposition of more KBr layers. The photoemission studies reveal that the resultant photocurrent is enhanced with increasing film thickness and it is directly related to the surface area coverage and grain density.",0

441,1,"Egocentric Effective Conductance Centrality and General Degree We study the popular centrality measure known as effective conductance or in some circles as information centrality. After reinterpreting this measure in terms of modulus (energy) of families of walks on the network, we introduce a new measure called shell modulus centrality, that relies on the egocentric structure of the graph. Egonetworks are networks formed around a focal node (ego) with a specific order of neighborhoods. We then propose efficient analytical and approximate methods for computing these measures on both undirected and directed networks. Finally, we describe a simple method inspired by shell modulus centrality, called general degree, which improves simple degree centrality and could prove to be a useful tool for network science.",0
443,1,"A vanishing theorem for co-Higgs bundles on the moduli space of bundles We consider smooth moduli spaces of semistable vector bundles of fixed rank and determinant on a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus at least $3$. The choice of a Poincar\'e bundle for such a moduli space $M$ induces an isomorphism between $X$ and a component of the moduli space of semistable sheaves over $M$. We prove that $h^0(M, \text{End}({\mathcal E})\otimes TM)= 1$

747,1,"Stellar Mass Function of Active and Quiescent Galaxies via the Continuity Equation The continuity equation is developed for the stellar mass content of galaxies and exploited to derive the stellar mass function of active and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range $z\sim 0\mbox{--}8$. The continuity equation requires two specific inputs gauged from observations: (i) the star formation rate functions determined on the basis of the latest UV+far-IR/submillimeter/radio measurements and (ii) average star formation histories for individual galaxies, with different prescriptions for disks and spheroids. The continuity equation also includes a source term taking into account (dry) mergers, based on recent numerical simulations and consistent with observations. The stellar mass function derived from the continuity equation is coupled with the halo mass function and with the SFR functions to derive the star formation efficiency and the main sequence of star-forming galaxies via the abundance-matching technique. A remarkable agreement of the resulting stellar mass functions for active and quiescent galaxies of the galaxy main sequence, and of the star formation efficiency with current observations is found, the comparison with data also allows the characteristic timescales for star formation and quiescence of massive galaxies, the star formation history of their progenitors, and the amount of stellar mass added by in situ star formation versus that contributed by external merger events to be robustly constrained. The continuity equation is shown to yield quantitative outcomes that detailed physical models must comply with, that can provide a basis for improving the (subgrid) physical recipes implemented in theoretical approaches and numerical simulations, and that can offer a benchmark for forecasts on future observations with multiband coverage, as will become routinely achievable in the era of JWST.",0

800,1,"Causal Decomposition in the Mutual Causation System Inference of causality in time series has been principally based on the prediction paradigm. Nonetheless, the predictive causality approach may overlook the simultaneous and reciprocal nature of causal interactions observed in real world phenomena. Here, we present a causal decomposition approach that is not based on prediction, but based on the instantaneous phase dependency between the intrinsic components of a decomposed time series. The method involves two assumptions: (1) any cause effect relationship can be quantified with instantaneous phase dependency between the source and target decomposed as intrinsic components at specific time scale, and (2) the phase dynamics in the target originating from the source are separable from the target itself. Using empirical mode decomposition, we show that the causal interaction is encoded in instantaneous phase dependency at a specific time scale, and this phase dependency is diminished when the causal-related intrinsic component is removed from the effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generic applicability of our method to both stochastic and deterministic systems, and show the consistency of the causal decomposition method compared to existing methods, and finally uncover the key mode of causal interactions in both the modelled and actual predator prey system. We anticipate that this novel approach will assist with revealing causal interactions in complex networks not accounted for by current methods.",0

924,1,"Non-extensive statistics in spin precession Many experiments utilize the precession of trapped particles in magnetic fields to perform high-precision measurements. It has often been presumed that after free precession, initially polarized particles will form a Gaussian phase distribution in the plane of precession.

The results are consistent with distributions predicted by non-extensive statistics.",0
966,1,"On a class of integrable systems of Monge-Ampère type We investigate a class of multi-dimensional two-component systems of Monge-Ampère type that can be viewed as generalisations of heavenly type equations appearing in a self-dual Ricci-flat geometry. Based on the Jordan-Kronecker theory of the skew-symmetric matrix pencils, a classification of normal forms of such systems is obtained. All two-component systems of Monge-Ampère type turn out to be integrable and can be represented as the commutativity conditions of parameter-dependent vector fields. Geometrically, systems of Monge-Ampère type are associated with linear sections of the Grassmannians. This leads to an invariant differential-geometric characterisation of the Monge-Ampère property.",0
1087,1,"Covering monopole map and higher degree in non commutative geometry In this paper we develop analysis of the monopole maps over universal covering spaces of compact four manifolds. We induce a property on local properness of the covering monopole maps under the condition of closeness of the AHS complexes. In particular we construct a higher degree of the covering monopole maps when their linearized equations are isomorphic, which induces a homomorphism between K group of the group C^* algebras. It involves non linear analysis on the covering spaces, which is related to L^p cohomology. We also obtain various Sobolev estimates on the covering spaces.

1128,1,"Data Based Identification and Prediction of Nonlinear and Complex Dynamical Systems The problem of reconstructing nonlinear and complex dynamical systems from measured data or time series is central to many scientific disciplines including physical, biological, computer, and social sciences, as well as engineering and economics. In this paper, we review the recent advances in this forefront and rapidly evolving field, aiming to cover topics such as compressive sensing (a novel optimization paradigm for sparse-signal reconstruction), noised-induced dynamical mapping, perturbations, reverse engineering, synchronization, inner composition alignment, global silencing, Granger Causality and alternative optimization algorithms. Often, these rely on various concepts from statistical and nonlinear physics such as phase transitions, bifurcation, stabilities, and robustness. The methodologies have the potential to significantly improve our ability to understand a variety of complex dynamical systems ranging from gene regulatory systems to social networks towards the ultimate goal of controlling such systems. Despite recent progress, many challenges remain. A purpose of this Review is then to point out the specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as to stimulate further efforts in this interdisciplinary field.",0

1359,1,"Reliable uncertainties in indirect measurements In this article we present very intuitive, easy to follow, yet mathematically rigorous, approach to the so called data fitting process. Rather than minimizing the distance between measured and simulated data points, we prefer to find such an area in searched parameters' space that generates simulated curve crossing as many acquired experimental points as possible, but at least half of them. Such a task is pretty easy to attack with interval calculations. The problem is, however, that interval calculations operate on guaranteed intervals, that is on pairs of numbers determining minimal and maximal values of measured quantity while in vast majority of cases our measured quantities are expressed rather as a pair of two other numbers: the average value and its standard deviation. Here we propose the combination of interval calculus with basic notions from probability and statistics. This approach makes possible to obtain the results in familiar form as reliable values of searched parameters, their standard deviations, and their correlations as well. There are no assumptions concerning the probability density distributions of experimental values besides the obvious one that their variances are finite. Neither the symmetry of uncertainties of experimental distributions is required (assumed) nor those uncertainties have to be `small.' As a side effect, outliers are quietly and safely ignored, even if numerous.",0
1374,1,"Angular momentum and local gravitational instability in galaxy discs: does $Q$ correlate with $j$ or $M\,$? We introduce a new diagnostic for exploring the link between angular momentum and local gravitational instability in galaxy discs. Our diagnostic incorporates the latest developments in disc instability research, is fully consistent with approximations that are widely used for measuring the stellar specific angular momentum, $j_{\star}=J_{\star}/M_{\star}$, and is also very simple. We show that such a disc instability diagnostic hardly correlates with $j_{\star}$ or $M_{\star}$, and is remarkably constant across spiral galaxies of any given type (Sa$\!-\!$Sd), stellar mass ($M_{\star}=10^{9.5}\!-\!10^{11.5}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and velocity dispersion anisotropy ($\sigma_{z\star}/\sigma_{R\star}=0\!-\!1$). The fact that $M_{\star}$ is tightly correlated with star formation rate ($\mathrm{SFR}$), molecular gas mass ($M_{\mathrm{mol}}$), metallicity ($12+\log\mathrm{O/H}$) and other fundamental galaxy properties thus implies that nearby star-forming spirals self-regulate to a quasi-universal disc stability level. This proves the existence of the self-regulation process postulated by several star formation models, but also raises important caveats.",0

1621,1,"An easy and efficient approach for testing identifiability of parameters The feasibility of uniquely estimating parameters of dynamical systems from observations is a widely discussed aspect of mathematical modelling. Several approaches have been published for analyzing identifiability. However, they are typically computationally demanding, difficult to perform and/or not applicable in many application settings. Here, an intuitive approach is presented which enables quickly testing of parameter identifiability. Numerical optimization with a penalty in radial direction enforcing displacement of the parameters is used to check whether estimated parameters are unique, or whether the parameters can be altered without loss of agreement with the data indicating non-identifiability. This Identifiability-Test by Radial Penalization (ITRP) can be employed for every model where optimization-based fitting like least-squares or maximum likelihood is feasible and is therefore applicable for all typical deterministic models. The approach is illustrated and tested using 11 ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The presented approach can be implemented without great efforts in any modelling framework. It is available within the free Matlab-based modelling toolbox Data2Dynamics. Source code is available at https://github.com/Data2Dynamics.",0

This is true for the whole mass and metallicity range. The new models are also ~0.1–0.3 dex brighter than the previous models with similar remnant masses.

We present a formula for the integral in the case where N is a subsupermanifold which is appropriately non-degenerate with respect to Q. In the process, we discuss the linear algebra necessary to express our result in a coordinate independent way.

2195,1,"Inflated nodes in superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry Superconductors are characterized by the gap in their low-energy excitation spectrum.In unconventional superconductors, the gap often has nodes, that is, regions on the Fermi surface where it goes to zero. It is commonly believed that in the absence of disorder an external magnetic field, there are three possibilities: The gap is nodeless, it has point nodes, or it has line nodes. Here we show that for an even-parity nodal superconducting state which breaks time-reversal symmetry, the low-energy excitation spectrum generally does not belong to any of these categories; instead it has extended Fermi surfaces. These new Fermi surfaces can be visualized as the 2D surfaces generated by ""inflating"" point or line nodes into spheroids or tori, respectively. These inflated nodes are topologically protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, which we give in terms of a Pfaffian. We also show that, remarkably, superconducting states possessing these Fermi surfaces are typically ground state solutions. A crucial ingredient in our theory is that more than one band is involved in the pairing; since all candidate materials for even-parity superconductivity with broken time-reversal symmetry are multiband systems, we expect these $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Fermi surfaces to be ubiquitous.",0

The maximum magnitude relation with decline time (MMRD) and distance The origin and calibration of the maximum absolute magnitude relation with decline time (MMRD) for novae, first derived by Zwicky (1936) empirically validated by McLaughlin (1940) and widely used to estimate distances to classical novae and the near-constancy of the absolute magnitude of novae, 15 days after optical maximum, suggested by Buscombe and de Vaucouleurs (1955) are revisited in this paper and found to be valid. The main results presented in the paper are: (1) A physical derivation of the MMRD based on instantaneous injection of energy to the nova system. (2) A significantly better-constrained MMRD: M_{V,0} = 2.16(+-0.16)log_{10}t_2 - 10.804(+-0.117) using a two step calibration procedure. (3) It is shown that the MMRD is one of the best distance estimators to novae available to us and that accuracy of the distances is predominantly limited by an underestimated peak apparent brightness. (4) It is shown that the same MMRD calibration is applicable to novae of all speed class and to both Galactic and extragalactic novae. (5) It is shown that the absolute magnitudes of novae with 2.4 < t_2 < 86$days have a smaller scatter on day 12 (M_{V,12} = -6.616 +-0.043) compared to day 15 following optical maximum.

The usual half-filling concepts of one-electron lower Hubbard band and upper Hubbard band are defined in terms of the rotated electrons associated with the model Bethe-ansatz solution for all electronic density and spin density values and the whole finite repulsion range.

2435,1,"Mapping the Interstellar Magnetic Field Around the Heliosphere with Polarized Starlight Starlight that becomes linearly polarized by magnetically aligned dust grains provides a viable diagnostic of the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF). A survey is underway to map the local ISMF using data collected at eight observatories in both hemispheres. Two approaches are used to obtain the magnetic structure: statistically evaluating magnetic field directions traced by multiple polarization position angles, and least-squares fits that provide the dipole component of the magnetic field. We find that the magnetic field in the circumheliospheric interstellar medium (CHM), which drives winds of interstellar gas and dust through the heliosphere, drapes over the heliopause and influences polarization measurements. We discover a polarization band that can be described with a great circle that traverses the heliosphere nose and ecliptic poles. A gap in the band appears in a region coinciding both with the highest heliosheath pressure, found by IBEX, and the center of the Loop I superbubble. The least-squares analysis finds a magnetic dipole component of the polarization band with the axis oriented toward the ecliptic poles. The filament of dust around the heliosphere and the warm helium breeze flowing through the heliosphere trace the same magnetic field directions. Regions along the polarization band near the heliosphere nose have magnetic field orientations within 15 degrees of sightlines. Regions in the IBEX ribbon have field directions within 40 degrees of the plane of the sky. Several spatially coherent magnetic filaments are within 15 pc. Most of the low frequency radio emissions detected by the two Voyager spacecraft follow the polarization band. The geometry of the polarization band is compared to the Local Interstellar Cloud, the Cetus Ripple, the BICEP2 low opacity region, Ice Cube IC59 galactic cosmic ray data, and Cassini results.",0
2489,1,"On the equivalence between the Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi method and Richardson's non-stationary method The Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi (SRJ) method is an extension of the classical Jacobi iterative method to solve linear systems of equations ( Au=b ) associated with elliptic problems. It inherits its robustness and accelerates its convergence rate computing a set of P relaxation factors that result from a minimization problem. In a typical SRJ scheme, the former set of factors is employed in cycles of M consecutive iterations until a prescribed tolerance is reached. We present the analytic form for the optimal set of relaxation factors for the case in which all of them are strictly different, and find that the resulting algorithm is equivalent to a non-stationary generalized Richardson's method where the matrix of the system of equations is preconditioned multiplying it by D=diag(A) . Our method to estimate the weights has the advantage that the explicit computation of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the matrix A (or the corresponding iteration matrix of the underlying weighted Jacobi scheme) is replaced by the (much easier) calculation of the maximum and minimum frequencies derived from a von Neumann analysis of the continuous elliptic operator. This set of weights is also the optimal one for the general problem, resulting in the fastest convergence of all possible SRJ schemes for a given grid structure. The amplification factor of the method can be found analytically and allows for the exact estimation of the number of iterations needed to achieve a desired tolerance. We also show that with the set of weights computed for the optimal SRJ scheme for a fixed cycle size it is possible to estimate numerically the optimal value of the parameter ω in the Successive Overrelaxation (SOR) method in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate with practical examples that our method also works very well for Poisson-like problems in which a high-order discretization of the Laplacian operator is employed (e.g., a 9- or 17-points discretization). This is of interest since the former discretizations do not yield consistently ordered A matrices and, hence, the theory of Young cannot be used to predict the optimal value of the SOR parameter. Furthermore, the optimal SRJ schemes deduced here are advantageous over existing SOR implementations for high-order discretizations of the Laplacian operator in as much as they do not need to resort to multi-coloring schemes for their parallel implementation.",0
2499,1,"When intuition fails in assessing conditional risks: the example of the frog riddle Recently, the educational initiative TED-Ed has published a popular brain teaser coined the 'frog riddle', which illustrates non-intuitive implications of conditional probabilities. In its intended form, the frog riddle is a reformulation of the classic boy-girl paradox. However, the authors alter the narrative of the riddle in a form, that subtly changes the way information is conveyed. The presented solution, unfortunately, does not take this point into full account, and as a consequence, lacks consistency in the sense that different parts of the problem are treated on unequal footing. We here review, how the mechanism of receiving information matters, and why this is exactly the reason that such kind of problems challenge intuitive thinking. Subsequently, we present a generalized solution, that accounts for the above difficulties, and preserves full logical consistency. Eventually, the relation to the boy-girl paradox is discussed.",0

2748,1,"Achieving the Heisenberg limit in quantum metrology using quantum error correction Quantum metrology has many important applications in science and technology, ranging from frequency spectroscopy to gravitational wave detection. Quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit on measurement precision, called the Heisenberg limit, which can be achieved for noiseless quantum systems, but is not achievable in general for systems subject to noise. Here we study how measurement precision can be enhanced through quantum error correction, a general method for protecting a quantum system from the damaging effects of noise. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving the Heisenberg limit using quantum probes subject to Markovian noise, assuming that noiseless ancilla systems are available, and that fast, accurate quantum processing can be performed. When the sufficient condition is satisfied, a quantum error-correcting code can be constructed that suppresses the noise without obscuring the signal, the optimal code, achieving the best possible precision, can be found by solving a semidefinite program.",0

2988,1,"Efficient Analog Circuits for Boolean Satisfiability Efficient solutions to NP-complete problems would significantly benefit both science and industry. However, such problems are intractable on digital computers based on the von Neumann architecture, thus creating the need for alternative solutions to tackle such problems. Recently, a deterministic, continuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) was proposed (Nat.Phys. {\bf 7}(12), 966 (2011)) to solve a representative NP-complete problem, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). This solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on even the hardest benchmark $k$-SAT ($k \geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost through exponentially driven auxiliary variables. This paper presents a novel analog hardware SAT solver, AC-SAT, implementing the CTDS via incorporating novel, analog circuit design ideas. AC-SAT is intended to be used as a co-processor and is programmable for handling different problem specifications. It is especially effective for solving hard $k$-SAT problem instances that are challenging for algorithms running on digital machines. Furthermore, with its modular design, AC-SAT can readily be extended to solve larger size problems, while the size of the circuit grows linearly with the product of the number of variables and number of clauses. The circuit is designed and simulated based on a 32nm CMOS technology. SPICE simulation results show speedup factors of $\sim$10$^4$ on even the hardest 3-SAT problems, when compared with a state-of-the-art SAT solver on digital computers. As an example, for hard problems with $N=50$ variables and $M=212$ clauses, solutions are found within from a few $ns$ to a few hundred $ns$.",0

3192,1,"Controlling local quantum fluctuations of light using four-wave mixing in an atomic vapour The spatial character of the noise on a light field affects its usefulness for imaging. Multi-spatial-mode (MSM) squeezed light has noise below the quantum noise limit in multiple spatial modes, and can be used for super resolution imaging. The generation of such light has long been an experimental goal within the field of quantum optics. This work introduces the theory behind the generation of squeezed light, and its measurement using a homodyne detector. A four-wave mixing process in a rubidium 85 vapour is used to experimentally generate squeezed light. The properties of this squeezed light are investigated, through the use of homodyne detection with a bichromatic LO. This thesis further investigates how the squeezed quadrature changes from amplitude to phase over a range of 40 MHz. The MSM nature of a squeezed light field is directly investigated. The field is shown to contain at least 75 squeezed spatial modes in the frequency domain, each squeezed at a level of up to -2.5 dB. This thesis develops techniques to measure the spatial character of noise on a light field in the time domain. These are promising techniques for the analysis of the MSM nature of a squeezed light in the time domain.",0
3312,1,"Star formation in a galactic outflow Recent observations have revealed massive galactic molecular outflows that may have physical conditions (high gas densities) required to form stars. Indeed, several recent models predict that such massive galactic outflows may ignite star formation within the outflow itself. This star-formation mode, in which stars form with high radial velocities, could contribute to the morphological evolution of galaxies, to the evolution in size and velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component of galaxies, and would contribute to the population of high-velocity stars, which could even escape the galaxy. Such star formation could provide in-situ chemical enrichment of the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (through supernova explosions of young stars on large orbits), and some models also predict that it may contribute substantially to the global star formation rate observed in distant galaxies. Although there exists observational evidence for star formation triggered by outflows or jets into their host galaxy, as a consequence of gas compression, evidence for star formation occurring within galactic outflows is still missing. Here we report new spectroscopic observations that unambiguously reveal star formation occurring in a galactic outflow at a redshift of 0.0448. The inferred star formation rate in the outflow is larger than 15 Msun/yr. Star formation may also be occurring in other galactic outflows, but may have been missed by previous observations owing to the lack of adequate diagnostics.",0

3530,1,"Energy-constrained two-way assisted private and quantum capacities of quantum channels With the rapid growth of quantum technologies, knowing the fundamental characteristics of quantum systems and protocols is essential for their effective implementation. A particular communication setting that has received increased focus is related to quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computation. In this setting, a quantum channel connects a sender to a receiver, and their goal is to distill either a secret key or entanglement, along with the help of arbitrary local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In this work, we establish a general theory of energy-constrained, LOCC-assisted private and quantum capacities of quantum channels, which are the maximum rates at which an LOCC-assisted quantum channel can reliably establish a secret key or entanglement, respectively, subject to an energy constraint on the channel input states. We prove that the energy-constrained squashed entanglement of a channel is an upper bound on these capacities. We also explicitly prove that a thermal state maximizes a relaxation of the squashed entanglement of all phase-insensitive, single-mode input bosonic Gaussian channels, generalizing results from prior work. After doing so, we prove that a variation of the method introduced by Goodenough et al. [New J. Phys. 18, 063005 (2016)NJOPFM1367-263010.1088/1367-2630/18/6/063005] leads to improved upper bounds on the energy-constrained secret-key-agreement capacity of a bosonic thermal channel. We then consider a multipartite setting and prove that two known multipartite generalizations of the squashed entanglement are in fact equal. We finally show that the energy-constrained, multipartite squashed entanglement plays a role in bounding the energy-constrained LOCC-assisted private and quantum capacity regions of quantum broadcast channels.",0
3645,1,"Globally disruptive events show predictable timing patterns Globally disruptive events include asteroid/comet impacts, large igneous provinces and glaciations, all of which have been considered as contributors to mass extinctions. Understanding the overall relationship between the timings of the largest extinctions and their potential proximal causes remains one of science's great unsolved mysteries. Cycles of about 60 Myr in both fossil diversity and environmental data suggest external drivers such as the passage of the Solar System through the galactic plane. While cyclic phenomena are recognized statistically, a lack of coherent mechanisms and a failure to link key events has hampered wider acceptance of multi-million year periodicity and its relevance to earth science and evolution. The generation of a robust predictive model of timings, with a clear plausible primary mechanism, would signal a paradigm shift. Here, we present a model of the timings of globally disruptive events and a possible explanation of their ultimate cause. The proposed model is a symmetrical pattern of 63 Myr sequences around a central value, interpreted as the occurrence of events along, and parallel to, the galactic midplane. The symmetry is consistent with multiple dark matter disks, aligned parallel to the midplane. One implication of the precise pattern of timings and the underlying physical model is the ability to predict future events, such as a major extinction in 1–2 Myr.",0

3782,1,"Shape and spin distributions of large object populations from random projection areas We model the shape and spin characteristics of an object population when there are not enough data to model its single members. The data are random projection areas of the members. We construct a mapping $f(x)\rightarrow C(y)$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^2$, $y\in\mathbb{R}$, where $f(x)$ is the distribution function of the shape elongation and spin vector obliquity, and $C(y)$ is the cumulative distribution function of an observable $y$ describing the variation of the observed projection areas of one member, and show that the mapping is invertible. Using the projected area of an ellipsoid as our model, we obtain analytical basis functions for a function series of $C(y)$ and prove uniqueness and stability properties of the inverse problem. Even though the model error is considerably larger than the measurement noise for realistic cases of arbitrary shapes (such as asteroids), the main characteristics of $f(x)$ (such as the locations of peaks) are robustly recovered from the data.",0
3983,1,"Enhancing noise-induced switching times in systems with distributed delays The paper addresses the problem of calculating the noise-induced switching rates in systems with delay-distributed kernels and Gaussian noise. A general variational formulation for the switching rate is derived for any distribution kernel, and the obtained equations of motion and boundary conditions represent the most probable, or optimal, path, which maximizes the probability of escape. Explicit analytical results for the switching rates for small mean time delays are obtained for the uniform and bi-modal (or two-peak) distributions. They suggest that increasing the width of the distribution leads to an increase in the switching times even for longer values of mean time delays for both examples of the distribution kernel, and the increase is higher in the case of the two-peak distribution. Analytical predictions are compared to the direct numerical simulations, and show excellent agreement between theory and numerical experiment.",0

4087,1,"On the Practical Applications of Information Field Dynamics In this study we explore a new simulation scheme for partial differential equations known as Information Field Dynamics (IFD). Information field dynamics attempts to improve on existing simulation schemes by incorporating Bayesian field inference into the simulation scheme. The field inference is truly Bayesian and thus depends on a notion of prior belief. A number of results are presented, both theoretical and practical. Many small fixes and results on the general theory are presented, before exploring two general classes of simulation schemes that are possible in the IFD framework. For both, we present a set of theoretical results alongside the development of a prototype scheme. The first class of models corresponds roughly to traditional fixed-grid numerical PDE solvers. The prior Bayesian assumption in these models is that the fields are smooth, and their correlation structure does not vary between locations. For these reasons we call them translation-invariant schemes. We show the requirements for stability of these schemes, but most importantly we prove that these schemes indeed converge to the true behaviour of the field in the limit of high resolutions. Convergence had never been shown for any previous IFD scheme. We also find the error scaling of these codes and show that they implement something very analogous to a high-order finite-difference derivative approximation, which are the most elementary and well-studied numerical schemes. This is an important result, which proves the validity of the IFD approach. The second class of schemes, called the SPH-like schemes are similar to existing Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics codes, in which the simulation grid moves with the flow of the field being modelled.",0
4215,1,"Effective spin dephasing mechanism in confined two-dimensional topological insulators A Kramers pair of helical edge states in quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) is robust against normal dephasing but not robust to spin dephasing. In our work, we provide an effective spin dephasing mechanism in the puddles of two-dimensional (2D) QSHE, which is simulated as quantum dots modeled by 2D massive Dirac Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the spin dephasing effect can originate from the combination of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interaction, which gives rise to inelastic backscattering in edge states within the topological insulator quantum dots, although the time-reversal symmetry is preserved throughout. Finally, we discuss the tunneling between extended helical edge states and local edge states in the QSH quantum dots, which leads to backscattering in the extended edge states. These results can explain the more robust edge transport in InAs/GaSb QSH systems.",0
4237,1,"Bilayer graphene lattice-layer entanglement in the presence of non-Markovian phase noise The evolution of single particle excitations of bilayer graphene under effects of non-Markovian noise is described with focus on the decoherence process of lattice-layer (LL) maximally entangled states. Once the noiseless dynamics of an arbitrary initial state is identified by the correspondence between the tight-binding Hamiltonian for the AB-stacked bilayer graphene and the Dirac equation—which includes pseudovectorlike and tensorlike field interactions—the noisy environment is described as random fluctuations on bias voltage and mass terms. The inclusion of noisy dynamics reproduces the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes: A non-Markovian noise model with a well-defined Markovian limit. Considering that an initial amount of entanglement shall be dissipated by the noise, two profiles of dissipation are identified. On one hand, for eigenstates of the noiseless Hamiltonian, deaths and revivals of entanglement are identified along the oscillation pattern for long interaction periods. On the other hand, for departing LL Werner and Cat states, the entanglement is suppressed although, for both cases, some identified memory effects compete with the pure noise-induced decoherence in order to preserve the the overall profile of a given initial state.",0

By using a recently developed systematic ""order from quantum disorder"" analysis, we not only determine the true quantum ground state, but also evaluate the mass gap in the spin sector at $ \lambda &lt; 1 $, especially compute the the excitation spectrum of the Goldstone mode in the spin sector at $ \lambda=1 $ which would be quadratic without the analysis. The analysis also leads to different critical exponents on the two sides of the 2nd order transition driven by a roton touchdown at $ \lambda=1 $. The intimate analogy at $ \lambda=1 $ with the charge neutral Goldstone mode in the pseudo-spin sector in the Bilayer quantum Hall systems at the total filling factor $ \nu_T=1 $ are stressed.

4377,1,"Composite fermions in graphene fractional quantum Hall state at half filling: evidence for Dirac composite fermions Composite fermions in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are believed to form a Fermi sea of weakly interacting particles at half filling $\nu=1/2$. Recently, it was proposed (D. T. Son, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031027 (2015)) that these composite fermions are Dirac particles. In our work, we demonstrate experimentally that composite fermions found in monolayer graphene are Dirac particles at half filling. Our experiments have addressed FQH states in high-mobility, suspended graphene Corbino disks in the vicinity of $\nu=1/2$. We find strong temperature dependence of conductivity $\sigma$ away from half filling, which is consistent with the expected electron-electron interaction induced gaps in the FQH state. At half filling, however, the temperature dependence of conductivity $\sigma(T)$ becomes quite weak as expected for a Fermi sea of composite fermions and we find only logarithmic dependence of $\sigma$ on $T$. The sign of this quantum correction coincides with weak antilocalization of composite fermions, which reveals the relativistic Dirac nature of composite fermions in graphene.",0
4378,1,"Statistical properties of interaction parameter estimates in direct coupling analysis We consider the statistical properties of interaction parameter estimates obtained by the direct coupling analysis (DCA) approach to learning interactions from large data sets. Assuming that the data are generated from a random background distribution, we determine the distribution of inferred interactions. Two inference methods are considered: the L2 regularized naive mean-field inference procedure (regularized least squares, RLS), and the pseudo-likelihood maximization (plmDCA). For RLS we also study a model where the data matrix elements are real numbers, identically and independently generated from a Gaussian distribution; in this setting we analytically find that the distribution of the inferred interactions is Gaussian. For data of Boolean type, more realistic in practice, the inferred interactions do not generally follow a Gaussian. However, extensive numerical simulations indicate that their distribution can be characterized by a single function determined by a few system parameters after normalization by the standard deviation. This property holds for both RLS and plmDCA and may be exploitable for inferring the distribution of extremely large interactions from simulations for smaller system sizes.",0

The distribution of the particles' displacements is explicitly time dependent and does not scale. Since fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is often used to investigate diffusion processes, we discuss the influence of this lack of scaling on the possible outcome of the FCS measurements and calculate the FCS autocorrelation curves for such equilibrated CTRWs. The results show that although the deviations from Gaussian behavior may be detected when analyzing the short- and long-time asymptotic behavior of the corresponding curves, their bodies are still perfectly fitted by the fit forms used for normal diffusion. The diffusion coefficients obtained from the fits may however differ considerably from the true tracer diffusion coefficients as describing the time dependence of the mean squared displacement.",0

5154,1,"Topological structures are consistently overestimated in functional complex networks Functional complex networks have meant a pivotal change in the way we understand complex systems, being the most outstanding one the human brain. These networks have classically been reconstructed using a frequentist approach that, while simple, completely disregards the uncertainty that derives from data finiteness. We here provide an alternative solution based on Bayesian inference, with link weights treated as random variables described by probability distributions, from which ensembles of networks are sampled. By using both statistical and topological considerations, we prove that the role played by links' uncertainty is equivalent to the introduction of a random rewiring, whose omission leads to a consistent overestimation of topological structures. We further show that this bias is enhanced in short time series, suggesting the existence of a theoretical time resolution limit for obtaining reliable structures. We also propose a simple sampling process for correcting topological values obtained in frequentist networks.

The cold molecular gas is fuelling a vigorous starburst at a rate of $500-800\rm\thinspace M_{\odot}\rm\; yr^{-1}$ and powerful black hole activity in the form of both intense quasar radiation and radio jets. The radio jets have inflated huge bubbles filled with relativistic plasma into the hot, X-ray atmospheres surrounding the host galaxy. The ALMA observations show that extended filaments of molecular gas, each $10-20\rm\; kpc$ long with a mass of several billion solar masses, are located along the peripheries of the radio bubbles. The smooth velocity gradients and narrow line widths along each filament reveal massive, ordered molecular gas flows around each bubble, which are inconsistent with gravitational free-fall. The molecular clouds have been lifted directly by the radio bubbles, or formed via thermal instabilities induced in low entropy gas lifted in the updraft of the bubbles. These new data provide compelling evidence for close coupling between the radio bubbles and the cold gas, which is essential to explain the self-regulation of feedback.

We show that the modifying external perturbation terms in formulated no-pair equations are in general non-local and demonstrates singular behavior in gapless situation where they do not depend on semiconductor parameters. It is shown that lattice distortion perturbation can cause confinement of both electrons and holes in the same spatial region.

5964,1,"Locally Maximally Entangled States of Multipart Quantum Systems For a multipart quantum system, a locally maximally entangled (LME) state is one where each elementary subsystem is maximally entangled with its complement.

In this paper, we provide a pedagogical overview and physical interpretation of the the underlying mathematics that leads to these results and give a large class of explicit constructions for LME states. In particular, we construct all LME states for tripartite systems with subsystem dimensions $(2,A,B)$ and give a general representation-theoretic construction for a special class of stabilizer LME states. The latter construction provides a common framework for many known LME states.

The Tollund Man's feet exhibited two patterns of lifetime measurements: healthy zone exhibited lifetime values at four emission wavelengths but skin lesions at only two wavelengths. This first report of mummified samples' autofluorescence analysis suggests the potential of optical analysis for archeologic research",0
6202,1,"Colloquium: Atomic quantum gases in periodically driven optical lattices Time-periodic forcing in the form of coherent radiation is a standard tool for the coherent manipulation of small quantum systems like single atoms. In the last years, periodic driving has more and more also been considered as a means for the coherent control of many-body systems. In particular, experiments with ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices subjected to periodic driving in the lower kilohertz regime have attracted much attention. Milestones include the observation of dynamic localization, the dynamic control of the quantum phase transition between a bosonic superfluid and a Mott insulator, as well as the dynamic creation of strong artificial magnetic fields and topological band structures. This Colloquium reviews these recent experiments and their theoretical description. Moreover, fundamental properties of periodically driven many-body systems are discussed within the framework of Floquet theory, including heating, relaxation dynamics, anomalous topological edge states, and the response to slow parameter variations.",0

6525,1,"Boundary Hilbert spaces and trace operators We discuss the introduction of boundary Hilbert spaces for a class of physical systems for which it is not possible to factor their state spaces as tensor products of Hilbert spaces naturally associated to their boundaries and bulks, respectively. In order to do this we make use of the so called trace operators that play a relevant role in the analysis of PDEs in bounded regions. By taking advantage of these operators and some functorial aspects of the construction of Fock spaces, we will show how to obtain quantum dynamics at the boundaries defined in appropriate Hilbert spaces associated with them.",0
6697,1,"Quadratic magnetooptic spectroscopy setup based on photoelastic light modulation In most of the cases the magnetooptic Kerr effect (MOKE) techniques rely solely on the effects linear in magnetization ($\bm{M}$). Nevertheless, a higher-order term being proportional to $\bm{M}$$^2$ and called quadratic MOKE (QMOKE) can additionally contribute to experimental data. Handling and understanding the underlying origin of QMOKE could be the key to utilize this effect for investigation of antiferromagnetic materials in the future due to their vanishing first order MOKE contribution. Also, better understanding of QMOKE and hence better understanding of magnetooptic (MO) effects in general is very valuable, as the MO effect is very much employed in research of ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials. Therefore, we present our QMOKE and longitudinal MOKE spectroscopy setup with a spectral range of 0.8--5.5\,eV. The setup is based on light modulation through a photoelastic modulator and detection of second-harmonic intensity by a lock-in amplifier. To measure the Kerr ellipticity an achromatic compensator is used within the setup, whereas without it Kerr rotation is measured. The separation of QMOKE spectra directly from the measured data is based on measurements with multiple magnetization directions. So far the QMOKE separation algorithm is developed and tested for but not limited to cubic (001) oriented samples. The QMOKE spectra yielded by our setup arise from two quadratic MO parameters $G_s$ and $2G_{44}$, being elements of quadratic MO tensor $\bm{G}$, which describe perturbation of the permittivity tensor in the second order in $\bm{M}$.",0
6879,1,"Entanglement prethermalization in an interaction quench between two harmonic oscillators Entanglement prethermalization (EP) refers to a quasi-stationary nonequilibrium state of a composite system in which each individual subsystem looks thermal but the entire system remains nonthermal due to quantum entanglement between subsystems. We theoretically study the dynamics of EP following a coherent split of a one-dimensional harmonic potential in which two interacting bosons are confined. This problem is equivalent to that of an interaction quench between two harmonic oscillators. We show that this simple model captures the bare essentials of EP; that is, each subsystem relaxes to an approximate thermal equilibrium, whereas the total system remains entangled. We find that a generalized Gibbs ensemble exactly describes the total system if we take into account nonlocal conserved quantities that act nontrivially on both subsystems. In the presence of a symmetry-breaking perturbation, the relaxation dynamics of the system exhibits a quasi-stationary EP plateau and eventually reaches thermal equilibrium. We analytically show that the lifetime of EP is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the perturbation.",0

6952,1,"An Enhanced Lumped Element Electrical Model of a Double Barrier Memristive Device The massive parallel approach of neuromorphic circuits leads to effective methods for solving complex problems. It has turned out that resistive switching devices with a continuous resistance range are potential candidates for such applications. These devices are memristive systems - nonlinear resistors with memory. They are fabricated in nanotechnology and hence parameter spread during fabrication may aggravate reproducible analyses. This issue makes simulation models of memristive devices worthwhile. Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model of the device can be used to understand the underlying physical and chemical phenomena. However, such simulations are very time-consuming and neither convenient for investigations of whole circuits nor for real-time applications, e.g. emulation purposes. Instead, a concentrated model of the device can be used for both fast simulations and real-time applications, respectively. We introduce an enhanced electrical model of a valence change mechanism (VCM) based double barrier memristive device (DBMD) with a continuous resistance range. This device consists of an ultra-thin memristive layer sandwiched between a tunnel barrier and a Schottky-contact. The introduced model leads to very fast simulations by using usual circuit simulation tools while maintaining physically meaningful parameters. Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model and experimental data have been utilized as references to verify the concentrated model.",0

7261,1,"On the statistical inference for large precision matrices with dependent data Precision matrices play important roles in many statistical applications. We consider the statistical inference for precision matrices with ultra high-dimensional time dependent observations. More specifically, let $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ be the precision matrix and $\mathcal{S}$ be a given index set of interest. We propose a data-driven procedure to construct a class of confidence regions $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{S},\alpha}$ for $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{\mathcal{S}}$ such that $\sup_{0<\alpha<1} |\mathbb{P}(\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{\mathcal{S}}\in\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{S},\alpha})-\alpha|\rightarrow0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, where $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{\mathcal{S}}$ is a vector whose components are the elements of $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ indexed by $\mathcal{S}$. The proposed procedure includes two steps. We first derive an estimator $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Omega}}_{\mathcal{S}}$ for $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{\mathcal{S}}$ via penalized node-wise regressions, and then approximate the distribution of $n^{1/2}|\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Omega}}_{\mathcal{S}}-\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{\mathcal{S}}|_\infty$ by that of the $l_\infty$-norm of an ultra high-dimensional Gaussian random vector with mean zero and covariance formulated as an estimate for the long-run covariance of an unobservable process. Our analysis shows that the kernel-type estimator initially suggested by Andrews (1991) for the fixed dimensional long-run covariance can be also employed in the proposed procedure for the ultra high-dimensional scenario without imposing any additional stringent structural assumptions on the long-run covariance. Owing to the form of the kernel-type estimator, we develop a computationally feasible algorithm to implement the proposed procedure. Theoretical analysis shows the proposed procedure works well even without imposing the stationary assumption on the data.",0

From photoemission intensity images, we observed the tendency for individual exposed grain interiors to vary in photoemission intensity, regardless of whether or not films received CdCl$_2$ treatment. Additionally, grain boundaries develop contrast in photoemission intensity images different from grain interiors after an air exposure step, similar to observations of activated grain boundaries using scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy studies. These results suggest that work function varies locally, from one grain interior to another, as well as between grain boundaries and grain interiors.",0
7689,1,"Optical Communication in Space: Challenges and Mitigation Techniques In recent years, free space optical communication has gained significant importance owing to its unique features: large bandwidth, license-free spectrum, high data rate, easy and quick deployability, less power and low mass requirements. FSO communication uses the optical carrier in the near infrared band to establish either terrestrial links within the Earth's atmosphere or inter-satellite or deep space links or ground-to-satellite or satellite-to-ground links. However, despite the great potential of FSO communication, its performance is limited by the adverse effects viz., absorption, scattering, and turbulence of the atmospheric channel. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on various challenges faced by FSO communication system for ground-to-satellite or satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite links. It also provides details of various performance mitigation techniques in order to have high link availability and reliability. The first part of the paper will focus on various types of impairments that pose a serious challenge to the performance of optical communication system for ground-to-satellite or satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite links. The latter part of the paper will provide the reader with an exhaustive review of various techniques both at physical layer as well as at the other layers i.e., link, network or transport layer to combat the adverse effects of the atmosphere.

7794,1,"Does Local Structure Within Shock-sheath and Magnetic Cloud Affect Cosmic Ray Decrease? The sudden short duration decrease in cosmic ray flux is known as Forbush decrease which is mainly caused by interplanetary disturbances. Generally accepted view is that the first step of Forbush decrease is due to shock sheath and second step is due to Magnetic Cloud (MC) of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME). However, there are few questions which needs detail investigation. (i) Does the complete (or part of) ICME shock or MC contribute in cosmic ray decrease? (ii) Is there any internal structure associated with the ICMEs shock/MC which precisely contribute in decrease? To address these questions we have studied a total of 18 large ($>=8 \%$) Forbush decrease events and associated ICMEs. Majority of events shows multi-steps Forbush decrease profile. This leads into re-classification of Forbush decrease events depending upon the number of steps observed in their respective profile. The present study clearly indicates that not only broad regions (shock-sheath and MC) contribute to Forbush decrease but also localized structures within shock-sheath and MC have very much significant importance in Forbush decrease profile.",0
8439,1,"Dynamics of the quantum phase transition in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model: Excitations and correlations induced by a quench The ground state of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at unit filling undergoes the Mott-superfluid quantum phase transition. It belongs to the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with an exponential divergence of the correlation length in place of the usual power law. We present numerical simulations of a linear quench both from the Mott insulator to superfluid and back. The results satisfy the scaling hypothesis that follows from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In the superfluid-to-Mott quenches there is no significant excitation in the superfluid phase despite its gaplessness. Since all critical superfluid ground states are qualitatively similar, the excitation begins to build up only after crossing the critical point when the ground state begins to change fundamentally. The last process falls into the KZM framework.",0

NWERS is based on enhanced evanescent excitation and collection of spontaneous Raman scattering near nanophotonic waveguides, which for a one centimeter silicon nitride waveguide delivers a signal that is more than four orders of magnitude higher in comparison to a confocal Raman microscope. The reduced acquisition time and specificity of the signal allows for a quantitative and real-time characterization of surface species, hitherto not possible using Raman spectroscopy.

The coupling of the precessing spin to the cavity field yields phenomena similar to those observed in cavity optomechanics, including cavity amplification, damping, and optical spring shifts. These effects arise from autonomous optical feedback onto the atomic spin dynamics, conditioned by the cavity spectrum. We use this feedback to stabilize the spin in either its high- or low-energy state, where, in equilibrium with measurement backaction heating, it achieves a steady-state temperature, indicated by an asymmetry between the Stokes and the anti-Stokes scattering rates. For sufficiently large Larmor frequency, such feedback stabilizes the spin ensemble in a nearly pure quantum state, in spite of continuous measurement by the cavity field.",0
8994,1,"Old, Metal-Poor Extreme Velocity Stars in the Solar Neighborhood We report the discovery of 30 stars with extreme space velocities (> 480 km/s) in the Gaia-DR2 archive. These stars are a subset of 1743 stars with high-precision parallax, large tangential velocity (v_{tan}>300 km/s), and measured line-of-sight velocity in DR2. By tracing the orbits of the stars back in time, we find at least one of them is consistent with having been ejected by the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center. Another star has an orbit that passes near the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) about 200 Myr ago. Unlike previously discovered blue hypervelocity stars, our sample is metal-poor (-1.5 < [Fe/H] < -1.0) and quite old (>1 Gyr). We discuss possible mechanisms for accelerating old stars to such extreme velocities. The high observed space density of this population, relative to potential acceleration mechanisms, implies that these stars are probably bound to the Milky Way. If they are bound, the discovery of this population would require a local escape speed of around 600 km/s and consequently imply a virial mass of M_{200} = 1.4 x 10^{12} Msun for the Milky Way.",0
9033,1,"Double resonant absorption measurement of acetylene symmetric vibrational states probed with cavity ring down spectroscopy A novel mid-infrared/near-infrared double resonant absorption setup for studying infrared-inactive vibrational states is presented. A strong vibrational transition in the mid-infrared region is excited using an idler beam from a singly resonant continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator, to populate an intermediate vibrational state. High output power of the optical parametric oscillator and the strength of the mid-infrared transition result in efficient population transfer to the intermediate state, which allows measuring secondary transitions from this state with a high signal-to-noise ratio. A secondary, near-infrared transition from the intermediate state is probed using cavity ring down spectroscopy, which provides high sensitivity in this wavelength region. Due to the narrow linewidths of the excitation sources, the rovibrational lines of the secondary transition are measured with sub-Doppler resolution. The setup is used to access a previously unreported symmetric vibrational state of acetylene, $\nu_1+\nu_2+\nu_3+\nu_4^1+\nu_5^{-1}$ in the normal mode notation. Single-photon transitions to this state from the vibrational ground state are forbidden. Ten lines of the newly measured state are observed and fitted with the linear least-squares method to extract the band parameters. The vibrational term value was measured to be at 9775.0018(45) $\text{cm}^{-1}$, the rotational parameter $B$ was 1.162222 $\text{cm}^{-1}$, and the quartic centrifugal distortion parameter $D$ was 3.998(62)$\times 10^{-6} \text{cm}^{-1}$, where the numbers in the parenthesis are one-standard errors in the least significant digits.",0
9131,1,"Measurement Protocol for the Entanglement Spectrum of Cold Atoms Entanglement, and, in particular, the entanglement spectrum, plays a major role in characterizing many-body quantum systems. While there has been a surge of theoretical works on the subject, no experimental measurement has been performed to date because of the lack of an implementable measurement scheme. Here, we propose a measurement protocol to access the entanglement spectrum of many-body states in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices. Our scheme effectively performs a Ramsey spectroscopy of the entanglement Hamiltonian and is based on the ability to produce several copies of the state under investigation, together with the possibility to perform a global swap gate between two copies conditioned on the state of an auxiliary qubit. We show how the required conditional swap gate can be implemented with cold atoms, either by using Rydberg interactions or coupling the atoms to a cavity mode. We illustrate these ideas on a simple (extended) Bose-Hubbard model where such a measurement protocol reveals topological features of the Haldane phase.",0

9232,1,"Estimation of the Perturbing Accelerations Induced on the LARES Satellite by Neutral Atmosphere Drag The laser-ranged satellite LARES is expected to provide new refined measurements of relativistic physics, as well as significant contributions to space geodesy and geophysics. The very low area-to-mass ratio of this passive and dense satellite was chosen to reduce as much as possible the disturbing effects of non-gravitational perturbations. However, because of its height, about 1450 km compared with about 5800-5900 km for the two LAGEOS satellites, LARES is exposed to a much stronger drag due to neutral atmosphere. From a precise orbit determination, analyzing the laser ranging normal points of LARES over a time span of about 3.7 years, it was found an average semi-major axis decay rate of -0.999 m per year, corresponding to a non-conservative net force with a mean along-track acceleration of -1.444 x 10^-11 m/s^2. By means of a modified version of the SATRAP (ISTI/CNR) code, the neutral drag perturbation acting on LARES was evaluated over the same time span, taking into account the real evolution of solar and geomagnetic activities, with five thermospheric density models. All of them were able to model most of the observed semi-major axis decay, with differences among the average drag coefficients smaller than 10%. A further independent check carried out analyzing the orbital decay of a passive spherical satellite (Ajisai) just 40 km higher than LARES, it was then concluded that some of the currently best models developed for neutral atmosphere, within their uncertainties and range of applicability, were able to account for most (about 98.6%) of the observed semi-major axis decay of LARES. Finally, after modeling the neutral atmosphere drag, a residual semi-major axis decay, corresponding to an average along-track acceleration of about -2 x 10^-13 m/s^2 (i.e. about 1/72 of neutral drag), was detected as well.",0

9555,1,"Markov State Models from short non-Equilibrium Simulations - Analysis and Correction of Estimation Bias Many state of the art methods for the thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of large and complex biomolecular systems by simulation rely on ensemble approaches, where data from large numbers of relatively short trajectories are integrated. In this context, Markov state models (MSMs) are extremely popular because they can be used to compute stationary quantities and long-time kinetics from ensembles of short simulations, provided that these short simulations are in ""local equilibrium"" within the MSM states. However, in the last over 15 years since the inception of MSMs, it has been controversially discussed and not yet been answered how deviations from local equilibrium can be detected, whether these deviations induce a practical bias in MSM estimation, and how to correct for them. In this paper, we address these issues: We systematically analyze the estimation of Markov state models (MSMs) from short non-equilibrium simulations, and we provide an expression for the error between unbiased transition probabilities and the expected estimate from many short simulations. We show that the unbiased MSM estimate can be obtained even from relatively short non-equilibrium simulations in the limit of long lag times and good discretization. Further, we exploit observable operator model (OOM) theory to derive an unbiased estimator for the MSM transition matrix that corrects for the effect of starting out of equilibrium, even when short lag times are used. Finally, we show how the OOM framework can be used to estimate the exact eigenvalues or relaxation timescales of the system without estimating an MSM transition matrix, which allows us to practically assess the discretization quality of the MSM. Applications to model systems and molecular dynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide are included for illustration. The improved MSM estimator is implemented in PyEMMA as of version 2.3.",0

9685,1,"Universal Spectral Correlations in the Chaotic Wave Function, and the Development of Quantum Chaos We investigate the appearance of quantum chaos in a single many-body wave function by analyzing the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of its reduced density matrix $\rho_A$ of a spatial subsystem A. We find that the spectrum of $\rho_A$ is described by a so-called Wishart random matrix, which exhibits universal spectral correlations between eigenvalues separated by distances ranging from one up to many mean level spacings. We use these universal spectral characteristics of $\rho_A$ as a definition of chaos in the wave function. A simple and precise characterization of such correlations is a segment of linear growth at sufficiently long times, recently called the ""ramp"", of the spectral form factor. Specifically, numerical results for the spectral form factor of $\rho_A$ of generic non-integrable systems, such as one-dimensional quantum Ising and Floquet spin models, are found to exhibit an universal ramp identical to that appearing for a random pure state, in which $\rho_A$ is the Wishart random matrix. In addition, we study the development of chaos in the wave function by letting an initial direct product state evolve under the unitary time evolution. We find that the universal spectral correlations as manifested by the ramp set in as soon as the entanglement entropy begins to grow, and first develop for the eigenvalues at the top of the spectrum of $\rho_A$, subsequently spreading over the entire spectrum at later times. Finally, we study a prethermalized regime described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which develops in a rapidly driven Floquet model at intermediate times. We find that the prethermalized regime exhibits no chaos, as evidenced by the absence of a ramp in the spectral form factor of $\rho_A$, while the universal spectral correlations start to develop when the prethermalized regime finally relaxes at late times to the fully thermalized chaotic regime.",0

In the present paper, we construct a compact moduli stack admitting a perfect obstruction theory by introducing the notion of a dormant faithful twisted $G$-oper (or, a $G$-do'per, for short). Moreover, by means of the resulting virtual fundamental class, we obtain a semisimple CohFT (= cohomological field theory) valued in the $l$-adic \'etale cohomology of the moduli stack classifying pointed stable curves in positive characteristic. This CohFT gives an analogue of the Witten-Kontsevich theorem describing the intersection numbers of psi classes on the moduli stack of $G$-do'pers.",0

While the latter aims at computing the exact degree growth of a given mapping based on the structure of its singularities, we content ourselves with obtaining an answer as to whether a given system is integrable or not. We present several examples illustrating our method as well as its limitations. We also compare the present method to the full-deautonomisation approach we recently introduced.",0

10885,1,"A surgical approach to the anatomo-functional structure of language Introduction
Language is the most widely mapped cognitive function during brain surgery. Intraoperative language functional mapping using direct electrical stimulation under awake conditions is currently the gold standard technique for establishing the causal link between an area and a deficit that would be caused by its resection. It is also a powerful tool to investigate the anatomical correlates of current neuropsychological models of language.

Material and methods
The aim of this article is to reexamine the anatomo-functional structure of language that could be inferred from data obtained in direct electrical stimulation studies during awake surgery.

Results
Concomitantly with the development of new neuropsychological models of language, major advances have been made in our understanding of error patterns elicited by language network stimulation, both cortically and axonally. Following the recognition of visual information, the language network of picture naming is organized in parallel into two main dorsal phonological and ventral semantic subsystems that are sustained anatomically by two systems (arcuate fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital/inferior longitudinal/uncinate fasciculus respectively). Networks of articulatory and motor aspects of speech are now better depicted (aslant tract, third branch of longitudinal fasciculus). Finally, the links between the core language networks and the cognitive control networks are also emerging.

Conclusion
Mastering the language map and its dynamical properties should be a basic prerequisite for any neurosurgeon who wishes to operate on the brain with the aim of optimizing the extent of resection while preserving language abilities.",0

11630,1,"Nonideal quantum measurement effects on the switching-current distribution of Josephson junctions The quantum character of Josephson junctions is ordinarily revealed through the analysis of the switching currents, i.e., the current at which a finite voltage appears: A sharp rise of the voltage signals the passage (tunnel) from a trapped state (the zero voltage solution) to a running state (the finite voltage solution). In this context, we investigate the probability distribution of the Josephson-junction switching current taking into account the effect of the bias sweeping rate and introducing a simple nonideal quantum measurement scheme. The measurements are modeled as repeated voltage samplings at discrete time intervals, that is, with repeated projections of the time-dependent quantum solutions on the static or the running states, to retrieve the probability distribution of the switching currents. The distribution appears to be immune to the quantum Zeno effect, and it is close to, but distinguishable from, the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. For energy barriers comparable to the quantum fundamental energy state and in the fast bias current ramp rate the difference is neat, and remains sizable in the asymptotic slow rate limit. This behavior is a consequence of the quantum character of the system that confirms the presence of a backreaction of quantum measurements on the outcome of mesoscopic Josephson junctions.",0
11809,1,"On the use of financial analysis tools for the study of Dst time series in the frame of complex systems Technical analysis is considered the oldest, currently omnipresent, method for financial markets analysis, which uses past prices aiming at the possible short-term forecast of future prices. In the frame of complex systems, methods used to quantitatively analyze specific dynamic phenomena are often used to analyze phenomena from other disciplines on the grounds that are governed by similar dynamics. An interesting task is the forecast of a magnetic storm. The hourly Dst is used as a global index for the monitoring of Earth's magnetosphere, which could be either in quiet (normal) or in magnetic storm (pathological) state. This work is the first attempt to apply technical analysis tools on Dst time series, aiming at the identification of indications which could be used for the study of the temporal evolution of Earth's magnetosphere state. We focus on the analysis of Dst time series around the occurrence of magnetic storms, discussing the possible use of the resulting information in the frame of multidisciplinary efforts towards extreme events forecasting. We employ the following financial analysis tools: simple moving average (SMA), Bollinger bands, and relative strength index (RSI). Using these tools, we formulate a methodology based on all indications that could be revealed in order to infer the onset, duration and recovery phase of a magnetic storm, focusing on the temporal sequence they occur. The applicability of the proposed methodology is examined on characteristic cases of magnetic storms with encouraging results for space weather forecasting.",0

12252,1,"Two chemically similar stellar overdensities on opposite sides of the plane of the Galactic disk Our Galaxy is thought to have undergone an active evolutionary history dominated by star formation, the accretion of cold gas, and, in particular, mergers up to 10 gigayear ago. The stellar halo reveals rich fossil evidence of these interactions in the form of stellar streams, substructures, and chemically distinct stellar components. The impact of dwarf galaxy mergers on the content and morphology of the Galactic disk is still being explored. Recent studies have identified kinematically distinct stellar substructures and moving groups, which may have extragalactic origin. However, there is mounting evidence that stellar overdensities at the outer disk/halo interface could have been caused by the interaction of a dwarf galaxy with the disk. Here we report detailed spectroscopic analysis of 14 stars drawn from two stellar overdensities, each lying about 5 kiloparsecs above and below the Galactic plane - locations suggestive of association with the stellar halo. However, we find that the chemical compositions of these stars are almost identical, both within and between these groups, and closely match the abundance patterns of the Milky Way disk stars. This study hence provides compelling evidence that these stars originate from the disk and the overdensities they are part of were created by tidal interactions of the disk with passing or merging dwarf galaxies.",0

We discuss the influence of this choice of closure on the time evolution of fluid-dynamical variables and search for the best agreement to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation.,0
12529,1,"Tensor calculus in spherical coordinates using Jacobi polynomials. Part-I: Mathematical analysis and derivations This paper presents a method for the accurate and efficient computations on scalar, vector and tensor fields in three-dimensional spherical polar coordinates. The methods uses spin-weighted spherical harmonics in the angular directions and rescaled Jacobi polynomials in the radial direction. For the 2-sphere, spin-weighted harmonics allow for automating calculations in a fashion as similar to Fourier series as possible. Derivative operators act as wavenumber multiplication on a set of spectral coefficients. After transforming the angular directions, a set of orthogonal tensor rotations put the radially dependent spectral coefficients into individual spaces each obeying a particular regularity condition at the origin. These regularity spaces have remarkably simple properties under standard vector-calculus operations, such as \textit{grad} and \textit{div}. We use a hierarchy of rescaled Jacobi polynomials for a basis on these regularity spaces. It is possible to select the Jacobi-polynomial parameters such that all relevant operators act in a minimally banded way. Altogether, the geometric structure allows for the accurate and efficient solution of general partial differential equations in the unit ball.",0

12675,1,"Quantum nondemolition measurement of optical field fluctuations by optomechanical interaction According to quantum mechanics, if we keep observing a continuous variable we generally disturb its evolution. For a class of observables, however, it is possible to implement a so-called quantum nondemolition measurement: by confining the perturbation to the conjugate variable, the observable is estimated with arbitrary accuracy, or prepared in a well-known state. For instance, when the light bounces on a movable mirror, its intensity is not perturbed (the effect is just seen on the phase of the radiation), but the radiation pressure allows one to trace back its fluctuations by observing the mirror motion. In this work, we implement a cavity optomechanical experiment based on an oscillating micromirror, and we measure correlations between the output light intensity fluctuations and the mirror motion. We demonstrate that the uncertainty of the former is reduced below the shot-noise level determined by the corpuscular nature of light.",0

12893,1,"Investigating Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering of continuous variable bipartite states by non-Gaussian pseudospin measurements Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an asymmetric form of correlations which is intermediate between quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, and can be exploited as a resource for quantum communication with one untrusted party. In particular, steering of continuous-variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally, as a fundamental manifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on quadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that there exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by suitable non-Gaussian measurements. In this paper we perform a systematic investigation of EPR steering of bipartite Gaussian states by pseudospin measurements, complementing and extending previous findings. We first derive the density-matrix elements of two-mode squeezed thermal Gaussian states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent interest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these states as detected by a simple nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the correlation matrix constructed from pseudospin operators. This analysis reveals previously unexplored regimes where non-Gaussian measurements are shown to be more effective than Gaussian ones to witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise. We further consider an alternative set of pseudospin observables, whose expectation value can be expressed more compactly in terms of Wigner functions for all two-mode Gaussian states. However, according to the adopted criterion, these observables are found to be always less sensitive than conventional Gaussian observables for steering detection. Finally, we investigate continuous-variable Werner states, which are non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states, and find that pseudospin measurements are always more effective than Gaussian ones to reveal their steerability. Our results provide useful insights on the role of non-Gaussian measurements in characterizing quantum correlations of Gaussian and non-Gaussian states of continuous-variable quantum systems.",0
12904,1,"Scattering of ultrarelativistic electrons in ultrathin crystals Quantum theory is proposed of high energy electrons scattering in ultrathin crystals. This theory is based upon a special representation of the scattering amplitude in the form of an integral over the surface surrounding the crystal, and on the spectral method of determination of the wave function. The comparison is performed of quantum and classical differential scattering cross-sections in the transitional range of crystal thicknesses, from those at which the channeling phenomenon is not developed up to those at which it is established. It is shown that in this thickness range the quantum scattering cross-section, unlike the classical one, contains sharp peaks corresponding to some specific scattering angles, that is connected with the diffraction of the incident plane wave onto the periodically distributed crystal atomic strings. It is shown that the value of the scattering cross-section in the peaks varies periodically with the change of the target thickness. We note that this must lead to a new interference effect in radiation that is connected with the rearrangement of incident wave packet in transitional area of crystal thicknesses.",0

Together with the analysis of two-particle spatial correlations, they offer the prospect of uncovering fundamental symmetries and structure of correlated many-body states, as well as opening vistas into potential control and utilization of correlated quantum states as quantum-information resources. With the use of the second-order density matrix constructed via exact diagonalization of the microscopic Hamiltonian, and an analytic Hubbard-type model, we explore here the systematic evolution of characteristic interference patterns in the two-body momentum and spatial correlation maps of two entangled ultracold fermionic atoms in a double well, for the entire attractive- and repulsive-interaction range.

Ramsauer Townsend minima, shape resonances and binding energies of the resultant anions are identified and extracted from the elastic total cross sections calculated using the complex angular momentum method. The large discrepancy between the recently measured electron affinity of 0.116 and the previously measured value of 1.053 eV for Eu is resolved. Also, the previously measured electron affinities for Nd, Tb and Tm are reconciled and new values are extracted from the calculated total cross sections. The large electron affinities found here for these atoms, should be useful in negative ion nanocatalysis, including methane conversion to methanol without CO2 emission, with significant environmental impact..

13065,1,"Competing electronic instabilities of extended Hubbard models on the honeycomb lattice: A functional Renormalization Group calculation with high wavevector resolution We investigate the quantum many-body instabilities for electrons on the honeycomb lattice at half filling with extended interactions, motivated by a description of graphene and related materials. We employ a recently developed fermionic functional renormalization group scheme, which allows for highly resolved calculations of wave-vector dependences in the low-energy effective interactions. We encounter the expected anti-ferromagnetic spin density wave for a dominant on-site repulsion between electrons, and charge order with different modulations for dominant pure nth nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions. Novel instabilities towards incommensurate charge density waves take place when nonlocal density interactions among several bond distances are included simultaneously. Moreover, for more realistic Coulomb potentials in graphene including enough nonlocal terms there is a suppression of charge order due to competition effects between the different charge ordering tendencies, and if the on-site term fails to dominate, the semimetallic state is rendered stable. The possibility of a topological Mott insulator being the favored tendency for dominating second-nearest-neighbor interactions is not realized in our results with high momentum resolution.",0

13352,1,"Local optical control of ferromagnetism and chemical potential in a topological insulator Many proposed experiments involving topological insulators (TIs) require spatial control over time-reversal symmetry and chemical potential. We demonstrate reconfigurable micron-scale optical control of both magnetization (which breaks time-reversal symmetry) and chemical potential in ferromagnetic thin films of Cr-(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ grown on SrTiO$_3$. By optically modulating the coercivity of the films, we write and erase arbitrary patterns in their remanent magnetization, which we then image with Kerr microscopy. Additionally, by optically manipulating a space charge layer in the underlying SrTiO$_3$ substrates, we control the local chemical potential of the films. This optical gating effect allows us to write and erase p-n junctions in the films, which we study with photocurrent microscopy. Both effects are persistent and may be patterned and imaged independently on a few-micron scale. Dynamic optical control over both magnetization and chemical potential of a TI may be useful in efforts to understand and control the edge states predicted at magnetic domain walls in quantum anomalous Hall insulators.",0
13393,1,"Canonical Horizontal Visibility Graphs are uniquely determined by their degree sequence Horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) are graphs constructed in correspondence with number sequences that have been introduced and explored recently in the context of graph-theoretical time series analysis. In most of the cases simple measures based on the degree sequence (or functionals of these such as entropies over degree and joint degree distributions) appear to be highly informative features for automatic classification and provide nontrivial information on the associated dynamical process, working even better than more sophisticated topological metrics. It is thus an open question why these seemingly simple measures capture so much information. Here we prove that, under suitable conditions, there exist a bijection between the adjacency matrix of an HVG and its degree sequence, and we give an explicit construction of such bijection. As a consequence, under these conditions HVGs are unigraphs and the degree sequence fully encapsulates all the information of these graphs, thereby giving a plausible reason for its apparently unreasonable effectiveness.",0

As a control sample for them we use a population of 722 more thick RFGC galaxies with (a/b)$_{b}$ > 7, situated in the same volume. The UFG distribution over the sky indicates them as a population of quite isolated galaxies.We found that the specific star formation rate, sSFR$_{FUV}$, determined via the FUV GALEX flux, increases steadily from the early type to late type disks for both the UFG and RFGC–UFG samples, showing no significant mutual difference within each morphological type T. The population of UFG disks has the average HI-mass-to-stellarmass ratio by (0.25 ± 0.03) dex higher than that of RFGC–UFG galaxies. Being compared with arbitrary orientated disks of the same type, the ultra-flat edge-on galaxies reveal that their total HI mass is hidden by self-absorption on the average by approximately 0.20 dex.We demonstrate that using the robust stellar mass estimate via 〈B−K〉-color and galaxy type T for the thin disks, together with a nowaday accounting for internal extinction, yields their sSFR quantities definitely lying below the limit of −9.4 dex (yr$^{−1}$). The collected observational data on UFG disks imply that their average star formation rate in the past has been approximately three times the current SFR. The UFG galaxies have also sufficient amount of gas to support their observed SFR over the following nearly 9 Gyrs.",0
13777,1,"Quantum jumps, superpositions, and the continuous evolution of quantum states The apparent dichotomy between quantum jumps on the one hand, and continuous time evolution according to wave equations on the other hand, provided a challenge to Bohr's proposal of quantum jumps in atoms. Furthermore, Schroedinger's time-dependent equation also seemed to require a modification of the explanation for the origin of line spectra due to the apparent possibility of superpositions of energy eigenstates for different energy levels. Indeed, Schroedinger himself proposed a quantum beat mechanism for the generation of discrete line spectra from superpositions of eigenstates with different energies. However, these issues between old quantum theory and Schroedinger's wave mechanics were correctly resolved only after the development and full implementation of photon quantization. The second quantized scattering matrix formalism reconciles quantum jumps with continuous time evolution through the identification of quantum jumps with transitions between different sectors of Fock space. The continuous evolution of quantum states is then recognized as a sum over continually evolving jump amplitudes between different sectors in Fock space. In today's terminology, this suggests that linear combinations of scattering matrix elements are epistemic sums over ontic states. Insights from the resolution of the dichotomy between quantum jumps and continuous time evolution therefore hold important lessons for modern research both on interpretations of quantum mechanics and on the foundations of quantum computing. They demonstrate that discussions of interpretations of quantum theory necessarily need to take into account field quantization. They also demonstrate the limitations of the role of wave equations in quantum theory, and caution us that superpositions of quantum states for the formation of qubits may be more limited than usually expected.",0
13861,1,Universality classes of order parameters composed of many body bound states This theoretical paper discusses microscopic models giving rise to special types of order in which conduction electrons are bound together with localized spins to create composite order parameters. It is shown that composite order is related to the formation of a spin liquid with gapped excitations carrying quantum numbers that are a fraction of those of an electron. These spin liquids are special in the sense that their formation necessarily involves spin degrees of freedom of both the conduction and the localized electrons and can be characterized by nonlocal order parameters. A detailed description of such spin-liquid states is presented with a special care given to a demonstration of their robustness against local perturbations preserving the Lie group symmetry and the translational invariance.,0

In order to find a pattern in these, apparently contradictory, data several phenomenological formulas have been proposed but all have failed to predict a new result in agreement with the observations. In this paper we use a multivariate dimensional analysis approach to propose a fitting of the data in terms of the local parameters at perigee, as it would occur if this anomaly comes from an unknown fifth force with latitude dependence.

14439,1,"Spiral density waves and vertical circulation in protoplanetary discs Spiral density waves dominate several facets of accretion disc dynamics --- planet-disc interactions and gravitational instability (GI) most prominently. Though they have been examined thoroughly in two-dimensional simulations, their vertical structures in the non-linear regime are somewhat unexplored. This neglect is unwarranted given that any strong vertical motions associated with these waves could profoundly impact dust dynamics, dust sedimentation, planet formation, and the emissivity of the disc surface. In this paper we combine linear calculations and shearing box simulations in order to investigate the vertical structure of spiral waves for various polytropic stratifications and wave amplitudes. For sub-adiabatic profiles we find that spiral waves develop a pair of counter-rotating poloidal rolls. Particularly strong in the nonlinear regime, these vortical structures issue from the baroclinicity supported by the background vertical entropy gradient. They are also intimately connected to the disk's g-modes which appear to interact nonlinearly with the density waves. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the poloidal rolls are ubiquitous in gravitoturbulence, emerging in the vicinity of GI spiral wakes, and potentially transporting grains off the disk midplane. Other than hindering sedimentation and planet formation, this phenomena may bear on observations of the disk's scattered infrared luminosity. The vortical features could also impact on the turbulent dynamo operating in young protoplanetary discs subject to GI, or possibly even galactic discs.",0
14607,1,"Number-phase uncertainty and quantum dynamics of bosons and fermions interacting with a finite range and large scattering length in a double-well potential We define the standard quantum limit (SQL) for phase and number fluctuations, and describe two-mode squeezing for number and phase variables. When phase is treated as a unitary quantum-mechanical operator, number and phase operators satisfy an uncertainty relation. As a result, the usual definition of number squeezing parameter becomes modified. Two-mode number squeezing occurs when the number fluctuation goes below the SQL at the cost of enhanced phase fluctuation. As an application of number-phase uncertainty, we consider bosons or fermions trapped in a quasi-one dimensional double-well (DW) potential interacting via a 3D finite-range two-body interaction potential with large scattering length $a_s$. Under tight-binding or two-mode approximation, we describe in detail the effects of the range of interaction on the quantum dynamics and number-phase uncertainty in the strongly interacting or unitarity regime $a_s \rightarrow \pm \infty$. Our results show intriguing coherent dynamics of number-phase uncertainty with number-squeezing for bosons and phase squeezing for fermions. Our results may be important for exploring new quantum interferometry, Josephson oscillations, Bose-Hubbard and Fermi-Hubbard physics with ultracold atoms in DW potentials or DW optical lattices. Particularly interesting will be the question of the importance of quantum phase operators in two-atom interferometry and entanglement.",0
14699,1,"Characterization of the Acoustic Field Generated by the Single-Axis Acoustic Levitator The acoustic levitator utilizes two transducers that emit acoustic waves. A standing wave is generated between the two transducers that allows for the levitation of particles at the nodes of the standing wave. These levitated particles experience an instability. In order to aid in the process of solving this instability, the acoustic field created by one of the transducers was characterized in this experiment. This characterization helps to understand the intensity of the acoustic field at different points throughout the region and how the acoustic wave diverges as it travels away from the transducer.",0
14780,1,"de Broglie's double solution program: 90 years later Since de Broglie's pilot wave theory was revived by David Bohm in the 1950's, the overwhelming majority of researchers involved in the field have focused on what is nowadays called de Broglie-Bohm dynamics and de Broglie's original double solution program was gradually forgotten. As a result, several of the key concepts in the theory are still rather vague and ill-understood. In the light of the progress achieved over the course of the 90 years that have passed since de Broglie's presentation of his ideas at the Solvay conference of 1927, we reconsider in the present paper the status of the double solution program. More than a somewhat dusty archaeological piece of history of science, we believe it should be considered as a legitimate attempt to reconcile quantum theory with realism.",0
14928,1,"Joint reconstruction strategy for structured illumination microscopy with unknown illuminations The blind structured illumination microscopy (SIM) strategy proposed in (Mudry et al., 1992) is fully re-founded in this paper, unveiling the central role of the sparsity of the illumination patterns in the mechanism that drives super-resolution in the method. A numerical analysis shows that the resolving power of the method can be further enhanced with optimized one-photon or two-photon speckle illuminations. A much improved numerical implementation is provided for the reconstruction problem under the image positivity constraint. This algorithm rests on a new preconditioned proximal iteration faster than existing solutions, paving the way to 3D and real-time 2D reconstruction",0

15090,1,"On the Bayesian calibration of expensive computer models with input dependent parameters Computer models, aiming at simulating a complex real system, are often calibrated in the light of data to improve performance. Standard calibration methods assume that the optimal values of calibration parameters are invariant to the model inputs. In several real world applications where models involve complex parametrizations whose optimal values depend on the model inputs, such an assumption can be too restrictive and may lead to misleading results. We propose a fully Bayesian methodology that produces input dependent optimal values for the calibration parameters, as well as it characterizes the associated uncertainties via posterior distributions. Central to methodology is the idea of formulating the calibration parameter as a step function whose uncertain structure is modeled properly via a binary treed process. Our method is particularly suitable to address problems where the computer model requires the selection of a sub-model from a set of competing ones, but the choice of the `best' sub-model may change with the input values. The method produces a selection probability for each sub-model given the input. We propose suitable reversible jump operations to facilitate the challenging computations. We assess the performance of our method against benchmark examples, and use it to analyze a real world application with a large-scale climate model.",0

In particular we obtain manifolds admitting closed generalized G2 -structures not admitting closed (usual) G2 -structures.",0
15152,1,"Measures and applications of quantum correlations Quantum information theory is built upon the realisation that quantum resources like coherence and entanglement can be exploited for novel or enhanced ways of transmitting and manipulating information, such as quantum cryptography, teleportation, and quantum computing. We now know that there is potentially much more than entanglement behind the power of quantum information processing. There exist more general forms of non-classical correlations, stemming from fundamental principles such as the necessary disturbance induced by a local measurement, or the persistence of quantum coherence in all possible local bases. These signatures can be identified and are resilient in almost all quantum states, and have been linked to the enhanced performance of certain quantum protocols over classical ones in noisy conditions. Their presence represents, among other things, one of the most essential manifestations of quantumness in cooperative systems, from the subatomic to the macroscopic domain. In this work we give an overview of the current quest for a proper understanding and characterisation of the frontier between classical and quantum correlations (QCs) in composite states. We focus on various approaches to define and quantify general QCs, based on different yet interlinked physical perspectives, and comment on the operational significance of the ensuing measures for quantum technology tasks such as information encoding, distribution, discrimination and metrology. We then provide a broader outlook of a few applications in which quantumness beyond entanglement looks fit to play a key role.",0
15377,1,"PATCHWORK: A Multipatch Infrastructure for Multiphysics/Multiscale/Multiframe Fluid Simulations We present a ""multipatch"" infrastructure for numerical simulation of fluid problems in which sub-regions require different gridscales, different grid geometries, different physical equations, or different reference frames. Its key element is a sophisticated client-router-server framework for efficiently linking processors supporting different regions (""patches"") that must exchange boundary data. This infrastructure may be used with a wide variety of fluid dynamics codes; the only requirement is that their primary dependent variables be the same in all patches, e.g., fluid mass density, internal energy density, and velocity. Its structure can accommodate either Newtonian or relativistic dynamics. The overhead imposed by this system is both problem- and computer cluster architecture-dependent. Compared to a conventional simulation using the same number of cells and processors, the increase in runtime can be anywhere from negligible to a factor of a few; however, one of the infrastructure's advantages is that it can lead to a very large reduction in the total number of zone-updates.",0
15413,1,"Resistivity bound for hydrodynamic bad metals We obtain a rigorous upper bound on the resistivity $\rho$ of an electron fluid whose electronic mean free path is short compared to the scale of spatial inhomogeneities. When such a hydrodynamic electron fluid supports a non-thermal diffusion process -- such as an imbalance mode between different bands -- we show that the resistivity bound becomes $\rho \lesssim A \, \Gamma$. The coefficient $A$ is independent of temperature and inhomogeneity lengthscale, and $\Gamma$ is a microscopic momentum-preserving scattering rate. In this way we obtain a unified and novel mechanism -- without umklapp -- for $\rho \sim T^2$ in a Fermi liquid and the crossover to $\rho \sim T$ in quantum critical regimes. This behavior is widely observed in transition metal oxides, organic metals, pnictides and heavy fermion compounds and has presented a longstanding challenge to transport theory. Our hydrodynamic bound allows phonon contributions to diffusion constants, including thermal diffusion, to directly affect the electrical resistivity.",0
15489,1,"Arp 202: a TDG formed in a parent's extended dark matter halo? We report on H${\alpha}$ + [NII] imaging of the Arp 202 interacting pair and its tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidate as well as a GMOS long slit spectrum from the TDG candidate, observed with the Gemini North telescope. Our H${\alpha}$ + [NII] imaging reveals the TDG to have an elongated structure, $\sim$ 1.9 kpc in length with the two principal star forming knots at either end. Our observations also show the TDG candidate has a recessional V$_{H\alpha}$ $\sim$ 3032 km s$^{-1}$, within 100 km s$^{-1}$ of the parent pair's mean velocity and an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.10$\pm$0.41. The TDG's oxygen abundance is in good agreement with that of a star forming region in NGC 2719A, one of the parent galaxies, which has an estimated oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.05$\pm$0.41. The TDG's V$_{H\alpha}$ and oxygen abundance confirm previous results validating the candidate as a TDG. The absence of detectable emission from the TDG in $\textit{Spitzer}$ 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m images together with the lack of absorption lines and weak continuum in the spectrum is consistent with absence of an old population ($\gtrsim$ 0.5 Gyr). The location of the TDG within the interaction debris and the absence of indicators of an old stellar population in the TDG are consistent with a scenario in which the TDG is formed from HI stripped from the parent galaxies and within the extended dark matter halo of one of the parents as proposed by (Bournaud et al. 2003; Duc et al. 2004).",0
15505,1,"Maximal Angle Flow on the Shape Sphere of Triangles There has been recent work using Shape Theory to answer the longstanding and conceptually interesting problem of what is the probability that a triangle is obtuse. This is resolved by three kissing cap-circles of rightness being realized on the shape sphere; integrating up the interiors of these caps readily yields the answer to be 3/4. We now generalize this approach by viewing rightness as a particular value of maximal angle, and then covering the shape sphere with the maximal angle flow. Therein, we discover that the kissing cap-circles of rightness constitute a separatrix. The two qualitatively different regimes of behaviour thus separated both moreover carry distinct analytic pathologies: cusps versus excluded limit points. The equilateral triangles are centres in this flow, whereas the kissing points themselves -- binary collision shapes -- are more interesting and elaborate critical points. The other curves' formulae and associated area integrals are more complicated, and yet remain evaluable. As a particular example, we evaluate the probability that a triangle is Fermat-acute, meaning that its Fermat point is nontrivially located; the critical maximal angle in this case is 120 degrees.",0

15563,1,"Renormalising SPDEs in regularity structures The formalism recently introduced in [BHZ16] allows one to assign a regularity structure, as well as a corresponding ""renormalisation group"", to any subcritical system of semilinear stochastic PDEs. Under very mild additional assumptions, it was then shown in [CH16] that large classes of driving noises exhibiting the relevant small-scale behaviour can be lifted to such a regularity structure in a robust way, following a renormalisation procedure reminiscent of the BPHZ procedure arising in perturbative QFT. The present work completes this programme by constructing an action of the renormalisation group onto a suitable class of stochastic PDEs which is intertwined with its action on the corresponding space of models. This shows in particular that solutions constructed from the BPHZ lift of a smooth driving noise coincide with the classical solutions of a modified PDE. This yields a very general black box type local existence and stability theorem for a wide class of singular nonlinear SPDEs.",0
15747,1,"Complexity of eye fixation duration time series in reading of Persian texts: A multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis There is growing evidence that cognitive processes may have fractal structures as a signature of complexity. It is an an ongoing topic of research to study the class of complexity and how it may differ as a function of cognitive variables. Here, we explore the eye movement trajectories generated during reading different Persian texts. Features of eye movement trajectories were recorded during reading Persian texts using an eye tracker. We show that fixation durations, as the main components of eye movements reflecting cognitive processing, exhibits multifractal behavior. This indicates that multiple exponents are needed to capture the neural and cognitive processes involved in decoding symbols to derive meaning. We test whether multifractal behavior varies as a function of two different fonts, familiarity of the text for readers, and reading silently or aloud, and goal-oriented versus non-goal-oriented reading. We find that, while mean fixation duration is affected by some of these factors, the multifractal pattern in time series of eye fixation durations did not change significantly. Our results suggest that multifractal dynamics may be intrinsic to the reading process.",0

We used the tunable monochromatic synchrotron light of the DESIRS beamline of the SOLEIL facility near Paris to irradiate NO ices in the 6–13.6 eV range and measured desorption by quadrupole mass spectrometry. We find that NO photodesorption is very efficient, its yield being around 10$^{-2}$ molecule per incident photon for UV fields relevant to the diffuse and dense interstellar medium. We discuss the extrapolation of our results to an astrophysical context and we compare photodesorption of NO to previously studied molecules.",0
15803,1,"New construction of quantum error-avoiding codes via group representation of quantum stabilizer codes In quantum computing, nice error bases as generalization of the Pauli basis were introduced by Knill. These bases are known to be projective representations of finite groups. In this paper, we propose a group representation approach to the study of quantum stabilizer codes. We utilize this approach to define decoherence-free subspaces (DFSs). Unlike previous studies of DFSs, this type of DFSs does not involve any spatial symmetry assumptions on the system-environment interaction. Thus, it can be used to construct quantum error-avoiding codes (QEACs) that are fault tolerant automatically. We also propose a new simple construction of QEACs and subsequently develop several classes of QEACs. Finally, we present numerical simulation results encoding the logical error rate over physical error rate on the fidelity performance of these QEACs. Our study demonstrates that DFSs-based QEACs are capable of providing a generalized and unified framework for error-avoiding methods.",0

The corresponding localized solitons are hydrodynamic analogs of Bloch soliton in magnetic system, with asymptotically vanishing intensity. The 𝓟𝓣-odd complex soliton solution is shown to be iso-spectrally connected to the fundamental sech$^{2}$ solution through supersymmetry.

16111,1,"How does interference fall? We study how single- and double-slit interference patterns fall in the presence of gravity. First, we demonstrate that universality of free fall still holds in this case, i.e., interference patterns fall just like classical objects. Next, we explore lowest order relativistic effects in the Newtonian regime by employing a recent quantum formalism which treats mass as an operator. This leads to interactions between non-degenerate internal degrees of freedom (like spin in an external magnetic field) and external degrees of freedom (like position). Based on these effects, we present an unusual phenomenon, in which a falling double slit interference pattern periodically decoheres and recoheres. The oscillations in the visibility of this interference occur due to correlations built up between spin and position. Finally, we connect the interference visibility revivals with non-Markovian quantum dynamics.",0

16445,1,"Kinetic orbital moments and nonlocal transport in disordered metals with nontrivial band geometry We study the effects of spatial dispersion in disordered noncentrosymmetric metals. Specifically, we consider the kinetic magnetoelectric effect, and natural optical activity of metals, as well as the so-called dynamic chiral magnetic effect as a particular case of the latter. These effects stem from the magnetic moments of quasiparticles near the Fermi surface. We identify new disorder-induced contributions to these magnetic moments that come from the skew-scattering and side-jump processes, familiar from the theory of anomalous Hall effect. We show that at low frequencies the spatial dispersion of the conductivity tensor comes mainly either from the skew scattering or intrinsic contribution, and there is always a region of frequencies in which the intrinsic mechanism dominates. Our results imply that in clean three-dimensional metals, current-induced magnetization is in general determined by impurity skew scattering, rather than intrinsic contributions. Intrinsic effects are expected to dominate in cubic enantiomorphic crystals with point groups T and O, and in polycrystalline samples, regardless of their mobility.",0

An important figure of merit for photocathodes, the quantum efficiency, we define here for nonlinear photoemission processes in order to compare with linear photoemission.

We also consider the long term orbital stability and evolutionary behavior within the context of the Planet Nine Hypothesis, and find that BP$_{519}$ adds to the circumstantial evidence for the existence of this proposed new member of the Solar System, as it would represent the first member of the population of high-i, $\varpi$-shepherded TNOs.",0

17130,1,"Attenuation from the optical to the extreme ultraviolet by dust associated with broad absorption line quasars: the driving force for outflows We use mid-IR to UV observations to derive a mean attenuation curve out to the rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV) for ""BAL dust"" -- the dust causing the additional extinction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad absorption lines (BALQSOs). In contrast to the normal, relatively flat, mean AGN attenuation curve, BAL dust is well fit by a steeply rising, SMC-like curve. We confirm the shape of the theoretical Weingartner & Draine SMC curve out to 700 \AA, but the drop in attenuation at still shorter wavelengths is less than predicted. The identical attenuation curve for low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs) does not support them being a ""break out"" phase in the life of AGNs. Although attenuation in the optical due to BAL dust is low ($E(B-V) \sim 0.03 - 0.05$), the attenuation rises to one magnitude in the EUV because of the steep extinction curve. Here the dust optical depth is at the optimum value for radiative acceleration of dusty gas. Because the spectral energy distribution of AGNs peaks in the EUV where the optical depth is highest, the force on the dust dominates the acceleration of BAL gas. For LoBALs we get a negative attenuation curve in the optical. This is naturally explained if there is more light scattered into our line of sight in LoBALs compared with non-BALQSOs. We suggest that this and partial covering are causes when attenuation curves appear to be steeper in the UV that an SMC curve.",0

It is well known that distributions of wind power forecast errors often exhibit significant variability with respect to different forecast values. Therefore, appropriate probabilistic models that can provide accurate information for conditional forecast error distributions are of great need. On the basis of Gaussian mixture model, this paper constructs analytical conditional distributions of forecast errors for multiple wind farms with respect to forecast values. The accuracy of the proposed probabilistic models is verified by using historical data. Thereafter, a fast sampling method is proposed to generate scenarios from the conditional distributions which are non-Gaussian and interdependent. The efficiency of the proposed sampling method is verified.",0
17351,1,"Deep Graphs - a general framework to represent and analyze heterogeneous complex systems across scales Network theory has proven to be a powerful tool in describing and analyzing systems by modelling the relations between their constituent objects. In recent years great progress has been made by augmenting `traditional' network theory. However, existing network representations still lack crucial features in order to serve as a general data analysis tool. These include, most importantly, an explicit association of information with possibly heterogeneous types of objects and relations, and a conclusive representation of the properties of groups of nodes as well as the interactions between such groups on different scales. In this paper, we introduce a collection of definitions resulting in a framework that, on the one hand, entails and unifies existing network representations (e.g., network of networks, multilayer networks), and on the other hand, generalizes and extends them by incorporating the above features. To implement these features, we first specify the nodes and edges of a finite graph as sets of properties. Second, the mathematical concept of partition lattices is transferred to network theory in order to demonstrate how partitioning the node and edge set of a graph into supernodes and superedges allows to aggregate, compute and allocate information on and between arbitrary groups of nodes. The derived partition lattice of a graph, which we denote by deep graph, constitutes a concise, yet comprehensive representation that enables the expression and analysis of heterogeneous properties, relations and interactions on all scales of a complex system in a self-contained manner. Furthermore, to be able to utilize existing network-based methods and models, we derive different representations of multilayer networks from our framework and demonstrate the advantages of our representation. We exemplify an application of deep graphs using a real world dataset of precipitation measurements.",0

17555,1,"From Weakly Chaotic Dynamics to Deterministic Subdiffusion via Copula Modeling Copula modeling consists in finding a probabilistic distribution, called copula, whereby its coupling with the marginal distributions of a set of random variables produces their joint distribution. The present work aims to use this technique to connect the statistical distributions of weakly chaotic dynamics and deterministic subdiffusion. More precisely, we decompose the jumps distribution of Geisel-Thomae map into a bivariate one and determine the marginal and copula distributions respectively by infinite ergodic theory and statistical inference techniques. We verify therefore that the characteristic tail distribution of subdiffusion is an extreme value copula coupling Mittag-Leffler distributions. We also present a method to calculate the exact copula and joint distributions in the case where weakly chaotic dynamics and deterministic subdiffusion statistical distributions are already known. Numerical simulations and consistency with the dynamical aspects of the map support our results.",0

Here, we introduce ultrafast convergent beam electron diffraction (U-CBED) with a nanoscale probe beam for the quantitative retrieval of the time-dependent local distortion tensor. We demonstrate its capabilities by investigating the ultrafast acoustic deformations close to the edge of a single-crystalline graphite membrane. Tracking the structural distortion with a 28-nm/700-fs spatio-temporal resolution, we observe an acoustic membrane breathing mode with spatially modulated amplitude, governed by the optical near field structure at the membrane edge. Furthermore, an in-plane polarized acoustic shock wave is launched at the membrane edge, which triggers secondary acoustic shear waves with a pronounced spatio-temporal dependency. The experimental findings are compared to numerical acoustic wave simulations in the continuous medium limit, highlighting the importance of microscopic dissipation mechanisms and ballistic transport channels.",0

17923,1,"Flavor fluctuations in 3-level quantum dots: Generic SU(3)-Kondo fixed point in equilibrium and non-Kondo fixed points in nonequilibrium We study a $3$-level quantum dot in the singly occupied cotunneling regime coupled via a generic tunneling matrix to several multi-channel leads in equilibrium or nonequilibrium. We derive an effective model where also each reservoir has three channels labelled by the quark flavors $u$, $d$ and $s$ with an effective d.o.s. polarized w.r.t. an eight-dimensional $F$-spin corresponding to the eight generators of $SU(3)$. In equilibrium we perform a standard poor man scaling analysis and show that tunneling via virtual intermediate states induces flavor fluctuations on the dot which become $SU(3)$-symmetric at a characteristic and exponentially small low-energy scale $T_K$. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) we study in detail the linear conductance and confirm the $SU(3)$-symmetric Kondo fixed point with universal conductance $G=2.25 e^2/h$ for various tunneling setups by tuning the level spacings on the dot. In contrast to the equilibrium case, we find in nonequilibrium that the fixed point model is not $SU(3)$-symmetric but characterized by rotated $F$-spins for each reservoir with total vanishing sum. At large voltage we analyse the $F$-spin magnetization and the current in golden rule as function of a magnetic field for the isospin of the up/down quark and the level spacing to the strange quark. As a smoking gun to detect the nonequilibrium fixed point we find that the curve of zero $F$-spin magnetization has a particular shape on the dot parameters.

17926,1,"44 GHz Class I Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) Maser Survey in the Galactic Center We report on a large 44 GHz (7(0)–6(1) A (+)) methanol (CH(3)OH) maser survey of the Galactic Center. The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array was used to search for CH(3)OH maser emission covering a large fraction of the region around Sgr A. In 25 pointings, over 300 CH(3)OH maser sources (>10σ) were detected. The majority of the maser sources have a single peak emission spectrum with line of sight velocities that range from about −13 to 72 km s(−)(1). Most maser sources were found to have velocities around 35−55 km s(−)(1), closely following velocities of neighboring interacting molecular clouds (MCs). The full width at half-maximum of each individual spectral feature is very narrow (∼0.85 km s(−)(1) on average). In the north, where Sgr A East is known to be interacting with the 50 km s(−)(1) MC, more than 100 44 GHz CH(3)OH masers were detected. In addition, three other distinct concentrations of masers were found, which appear to be located closer to the interior of the interacting MCs. It is possible that a subset of masers is associated with star formation, although conclusive evidence is lacking.",0
18075,1,"EPR paradox, quantum nonlocality and physical reality Eighty years ago Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen demonstrated that instantaneous reduction of wave function, believed to describe completely a pair of entangled physical systems, led to EPR paradox. The paradox disappears in statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) according to which a wave function describes only an ensemble of identically prepared physical systems. QM predicts strong correlations between outcomes of measurements performed on different members of EPR pairs in far-away locations. Searching for an intuitive explanation of these correlations John Bell analysed so called local realistic hidden variable models and proved that correlations consistent with these models satisfy Bell inequalities which are violated by some predictions of QM and by experimental data. Several different local models were constructed and inequalities proven. Some eminent physicists concluded that Nature is definitely nonlocal and that it is acting according to a law of nonlocal randomness. According to these law perfectly random, but strongly correlated events, can be produced at the same time in far away locations and a local and causal explanation of their occurrence cannot be given. We strongly disagree with this conclusion and we prove the contrary by analysing in detail some influential finite sample proofs of Bell and CHSH inequalities and so called Quantum Randi Challenges. We also show how one can win so called Bell's game without violating locality of Nature. Nonlocal randomness is inconsistent with local quantum field theory, with standard model in elementary particle physics and with causal laws and adaptive dynamics prevailing in the surrounding us world. The experimental violation of Bell-type inequalities does not prove the nonlocality of Nature but it only confirms a contextual character of quantum observables and gives a strong argument against counterfactual definiteness and against a point of view according to which experimental outcomes are produced in irreducible random way.",0

18250,1,"Mixed Quantum Double Construction of Subfactors We generalize the quantum double construction of subfactors to that from arbitrary flat connections on 4-partite graphs and call it the \textit{mixed quantum double construction}.If all the four graphs of the original 4-partite graph are connected, it is easy to see that this construction produces Ocneanu's asymptotic inclusion of both subfactors generated by the original flat connection horizontally and vertically.The construction can be applied for example to the non-standard flat connections which appear in the construction of the Goodman-de la Harpe-Jones subfactors or to those obtained by the composition of flat part of any biunitary connections as in N. Sato's paper~[40].An easy application shows that the asymptotic inclusions of the Goodman-de la Harpe-Jones subfactors are isomorphic to those of the Jones subfactors of type $A_n$ except for the cases of orbifold type.If two subfactors $A\subset B$ and $A \subset C$ have common $A$-$A$ bimodule systems, we can construct a flat connection in general.Then by applying our construction to the flat connection, we obtain the asymptotic inclusion of both $A\subset B$ and $A \subset C$.We also discuss the case when the original 4-partite graph contains disconnected graphs and give some such examples.General phenomena when disconnected graphs appear are explained by using bimodule systems.",0

In characteristic zero, the new local zeta functions admit meromorphic continuations to the whole complex plane, but they are not rational functions.

We establish this result by showing that a well-posedness criterion provided by Kreiss fails to hold for this theory, and using a theorem provided by Strang. To show the nature of the problem we display a particular bounded (in Sobolev norms) sequence of initial data for the force-free equations such that at any given time as close to zero as one wishes, the corresponding evolution sequence is not bounded. Thus, the force-free evolution is noncontinuous in that norm with respect to the initial data. We furthermore prove that this problem is also ill-posed in the Leray-Ohya sense.",0
18667,1,"Altération de la réparation de l’ADN et cancer Maintaining the genetic integrity is a key process in cell viability and is enabled by a wide network of repair pathways. When this system is defective, it generates genomic instability and results in an accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and mutations that may be responsible for various clinical phenotypes, including susceptibility to develop cancer. Indeed, these defects can promote not only the initiation of cancer, but also allow the tumor cells to rapidly acquire mutations during their evolution. Several genes are involved in these damage repair systems and particular polymorphisms are predictive of the onset of cancer, the best described of them being BRCA. In addition to its impact on carcinogenesis, the DNA damage repair system is now considered as a therapeutic target of choice for cancer treatment, as monotherapy or in combination with other cytotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapies or radiotherapy. PARP inhibitors are nowadays the best known, but other agents are emerging in the field of clinical research.

We derive radial gradients in age, element abundances and IMF slope analysing optical and near-infrared absorption features from stacked spectra out to the half-light radius of 366 early-type galaxies with masses $9.9 - 10.8\;\log M/M_{\odot}$. We find flat gradients in age and [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio, as well as negative gradients in metallicity, consistent with the literature. We further derive significant negative gradients in the [Na/Fe] ratio with galaxy centres being well enhanced in Na abundance by up to 0.5 dex. Finally, we find a gradient in IMF slope with a bottom-heavy IMF in the centre (typical mass excess factor of 1.5) and a Milky Way-type IMF at the half-light radius. This pattern is mass-dependent with the lowest mass galaxies in our sample featuring only a shallow gradient around a Milky Way IMF. Our results imply the local IMF-$\sigma$ relation within galaxies to be even steeper than the global relation and hint towards the local metallicity being the dominating factor behind the IMF variations. We also employ different stellar population models in our analysis and show that a radial IMF gradient is found independently of the stellar population model used. A similar analysis of the Wing-Ford band provides inconsistent results and further evidence of the difficulty in measuring and modelling this particular feature.",0

18996,1,"Extreme conditions in the molecular gas of lensed star-forming galaxies at z~3 Atomic Carbon can be an efficient tracer of the molecular gas mass, and when combined to the detection of high-J and low-J CO lines it yields also a sensitive probe of the power sources in the molecular gas of high redshift galaxies. The recently installed SEPIA5 receiver at the focus of the APEX telescope has opened up a new window at frequencies 159 - 211 GHz allowing the exploration of the Atomic Carbon in high-z galaxies, at previously inaccessible frequencies from the ground. We have targeted three gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshift of about 3 and conducted a comparative study of the observed high-J CO/CI ~ratios with well-studied nearby galaxies. Atomic Carbon (CI(2-1)) was detected in one of the three targets and marginally in a second, while in all three targets the $J=7\to6$ CO line is detected. The CO(7-6)/CI(2-1), CO(7-6)/CO(1-0) line ratios and the CO(7-6)/(far-IR continuum) luminosity ratio are compared to those of nearby objects. A large excitation status in the ISM of these high-z objects is seen, unless differential lensing unevenly boosts the CO line fluxes from the warm and dense gas more than the CO(1-0), CI(2-1), tracing a more widely distributed cold gas phase.

19137,1,"Ion irradiation of carbonaceous chondrites: A new view of space weathering on primitive asteroids We present an experimental study on ion irradiation of carbonaceous chondrites, simulating solar wind irradiation on primitive asteroids, to better constrain the space weathering processes of low albedo objects. The irradiations were performed on pressed pellets of the CV Allende, CO Frontier Mountain 95002 and Lancé, CM Mighei, CI Alais, and ungrouped Tagish Lake meteorites, as well as on some silicate samples (olivine and diopside). We used 40keV He+He+ with fluences up to 6 × 1016 ions/cm2 corresponding to timescales of 103–104 years for an object in the Main Belt. Reflectance spectra were acquired ex situ before and after irradiations in the visible to mid-infrared range (0.4–16 µm). Several spectral modifications are observed. In the MIR range, we observe a shift of the phyllosilicates (near 3 and 10 µm) and silicates (near 10 µm) bands toward longer wavelength. In the visible-NIR range, spectral darkening and reddening are observed for some samples, while others show spectral brightening and blueing. Results are also compared with previous irradiation on ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites. We find that the spectral modifications in the visible range are correlated with the initial albedo/composition. We propose a model for space weathering effects on low albedo objects, showing that those with initial albedo between 5 and 9% shall not suffer SpWe effects in the visible range. These experiments provide new clues on spectroscopic features modifications within the visible-infrared ranges that could be detected in situ by future sample return missions (Hayabusa-2/JAXA and OSIRIS-REx/NASA).",0
19201,1,"Response of Solar Irradiance to Sunspot-area Variations One of the important open questions in solar irradiance studies is whether long-term variability (i.e. on timescales of years and beyond) can be reconstructed by means of models that describe short-term variability (i.e. days) using solar proxies as inputs. Preminger and Walton (2005, GRL, 32, 14109) showed that the relationship between spectral solar irradiance and proxies of magnetic-flux emergence, such as the daily sunspot area, can be described in the framework of linear system theory by means of the impulse response. We significantly refine that empirical model by removing spurious solar-rotational effects and by including an additional term that captures long-term variations. Our results show that long-term variability cannot be reconstructed from the short-term response of the spectral irradiance, which cautions the extension of solar proxy models to these timescales. In addition, we find that the solar response is nonlinear in such a way that cannot be corrected simply by applying a rescaling to sunspot area.",0
19259,1,"Topological quantum phase transition in the Ising-like antiferromagnetic spin chain BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ Since the seminal ideas of Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless, topological excitations are at the heart of our understanding of a whole novel class of phase transitions. In most of the cases, a single type of topological objects controls the transition. There are however some situations, still poorly understood, for which dual topological excitations fight to control the phase diagram and the transition. Finding controlled realization of such cases is thus of considerable interest. We show here that this class of transitions occurs in BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, a spin-1/2 Ising-like quasi-one dimensional antiferromagnet when subjected to a uniform magnetic field transverse to the Ising axis. Using neutron scattering experiments, we measure a drastic modification of the quantum excitations beyond a critical value of the magnetic field. This quantum phase transition is identified, through a comparison with theoretical calculations, to be a transition between two different types of solitonic topological objects.",0
19271,1,"Path Integral Monte Carlo study of particles obeying quantum mechanics and classical statistics Ultracold atomic systems have been of great research interest in the past, with more recent attention being paid to systems of mixed species. In this work, we carry out nonperturbative path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of N distinguishable particles at finite temperature, which can be thought of as an ultracold atomic system containing N distinct species. We use the PIMC approach to calculate thermodynamic properties of particles interacting via hard-sphere and hard-cavity potentials. The first problem we study is a two-particle system interacting via a hard-sphere and hard-cavity interaction in order to test the effectiveness of two approximations for the thermal density matrix corresponding to these potentials. We then apply the PIMC method to a system of many hard-sphere particles under periodic boundary conditions at varying temperature in order to calculate the energy per particle, pressure, and specific heat of the system. We examine how finite-size effects impact the results of PIMC simulations of hard-sphere particles and when the thermodynamic limit has been reached. Our results provide microscopic benchmarks for a system containing distinguishable particles, which can be thought of as a limiting case for ultracold atomic systems of mixed species.",0
19365,1,"Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in quantum dimer models We use exact diagonalization to study the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the quantum dimer model on the square and triangular lattices. Due to the nonergodicity of the local plaquette-flip dynamics, the Hilbert space, which consists of highly constrained close-packed dimer configurations, splits into sectors characterized by topological invariants. We show that this has important consequences for ETH: We find that ETH is clearly satisfied only when each topological sector is treated separately, and only for moderate ratios of the potential and kinetic terms in the Hamiltonian. By contrast, when the spectrum is treated as a whole, ETH breaks down on the square lattice and, apparently, also on the triangular lattice. These results demonstrate that quantum dimer models have interesting thermalization dynamics.",0

19450,1,"Improved Cloud resource allocation: how INDIGO-DataCloud is overcoming the current limitations in Cloud schedulers Performing efficient resource provisioning is a fundamental aspect for any resource provider. Local Resource Management Systems (LRMS) have been used in data centers for decades in order to obtain the best usage of the resources, providing their fair usage and partitioning for the users. In contrast, current cloud schedulers are normally based on the immediate allocation of resources on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that a request will fail if there are no resources (e.g. OpenStack) or it will be trivially queued ordered by entry time (e.g. OpenNebula). Moreover, these scheduling strategies are based on a static partitioning of the resources, meaning that existing quotas cannot be exceeded, even if there are idle resources allocated to other projects. This is a consequence of the fact that cloud instances are not associated with a maximum execution time and leads to a situation where the resources are under-utilized. These facts have been identified by the INDIGO-DataCloud project as being too simplistic for accommodating scientific workloads in an efficient way, leading to an underutilization of the resources, a non desirable situation in scientific data centers. In this work, we will present the work done in the scheduling area during the first year of the INDIGO project and the foreseen evolutions.",0

The polygon cardinality grows exponentially, and the growth rate $\lim_{n\in2\mathbb{N}}p_{n}^{1/n}\in(0,\infty)$ is called the connective constant and denoted by $\mu$. Madras [J. Stat.

19560,1,"Impact of near-PT symmetry on exciting solitons and interactions based on a complex Ginzburg-Landau model We present and theoretically report the influence of a class of near-parity-time-(PT-) symmetric potentials with spectral filtering parameter $\alpha_2$ and nonlinear gain-loss coefficient $\beta_2$ on solitons in the complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation. The potentials do not admit entirely-real linear spectra any more due to the existence of coefficients $\alpha_2$ or $\beta_2$. However, we find that most stable exact solitons can exist in the second quadrant of the $(\alpha_2, \beta_2)$ space, including on the corresponding axes. More intriguingly, the centrosymmetric two points in the $(\alpha_2, \beta_2)$ space possess imaginary-axis (longitudinal-axis) symmetric linear-stability spectra. Furthermore, an unstable nonlinear mode can be excited to another stable nonlinear mode by the adiabatic change of $\alpha_2$ and $\beta_2$. Other fascinating properties associated with the exact solitons are also examined in detail, such as the interactions and energy flux. These results are useful for the related experimental designs and applications.",0
19563,1,"Odd viscosity in two-dimensional incompressible fluids In this work, we present observable consequences of a parity-violating odd-viscosity term in incompressible 2+1D hydrodynamics. For boundary conditions depending on the velocity field (flow) alone we show that (i) the fluid flow quantified by the velocity field is independent of odd viscosity, (ii) the force acting on a closed contour is independent of odd viscosity, and (iii) the odd-viscosity part of torque on a closed contour is proportional to the rate of change of area enclosed by the contour with the proportionality constant being twice the odd viscosity. The last statement allows us to define a measurement protocol of odd viscostance in analogy to Hall resistance measurements. We also consider no-stress boundary conditions that explicitly depend on odd viscosity. A classic hydrodynamics problem with no-stress boundary conditions is that of a bubble in a planar Stokes flow. We solve this problem exactly for shear and hyperbolic flows and show that the steady-state shape of the bubble in the shear flow depends explicitly on the value of odd viscosity.",0
19676,1,"General quantum constraints on detector noise in continuous linear measurements In quantum sensing and metrology, an important class of measurement is the continuous linear measurement, in which the detector is coupled to the system of interest linearly and continuously in time. One key aspect involved is the quantum noise of the detector, arising from quantum fluctuations in the detector input and output. It determines how fast we acquire information about the system and also influences the system evolution in terms of measurement backaction. We therefore often categorize it as the so-called imprecision noise and quantum backaction noise. There is a general Heisenberg-like uncertainty relation that constrains the magnitude of and the correlation between these two types of quantum noise. The main result of this paper is to show that, when the detector becomes ideal, i.e., at the quantum limit with minimum uncertainty, not only does the uncertainty relation takes the equal sign as expected, but also there are two new equalities. This general result is illustrated by using the typical cavity QED setup with the system being either a qubit or a mechanical oscillator. Particularly, the dispersive readout of a qubit state, and the measurement of mechanical motional sideband asymmetry are considered.",0
19792,1,"The parameters uncertainty inflation fallacy Statistical estimation of the prediction uncertainty of physical models is typically hindered by the inadequacy of these models due to various approximations they are built upon. The prediction errors due to model inadequacy can be handled either by correcting the model's results, or by adapting the model's parameters uncertainty to generate prediction uncertainty representative, in a way to be defined, of model inadequacy errors. The main advantage of the latter approach is its transferability to the prediction of other quantities of interest based on the same parameters. A critical review of state-of-the-art implementations of this approach in computational chemistry shows that it is biased, in the sense that it does not produce prediction uncertainty bands conforming with model inadequacy errors.",0

We show that second-order dispersion of coupling allows for unbroken $CPT$ symmetry and supports propagation of stable vector solitons along the coupler. Small-amplitude solitons are found in explicit form. The combined effect of gain-and-loss and dispersive coupling results in several interesting features which include a separation between the components in different arms, nontrivial dependence of stability of a soliton on its velocity, and the existence of more complex stationary two-hump solutions. Unusual decay dynamics of unstable solitons is discussed too.",0

We show that different metrics can be related through a change in the tomographic map and prove that there exists a bijective relation between monotone quantum metrics associated with different operator monotone functions. Such a bijective relation is uniquely defined in terms of solutions of a first order second degree differential equation for the parameters of the involved tomographic maps.

Then we provide a second example where two monotone metrics are uniquely related through their tomographic parameters.",0

20137,1,"Role of magnetosonic solitons in perpendicular collisionless shock reformation The nature of the magnetic structure arising from ion specular reflection in shock compression studies is examined by means of 1D particle-in-cell simulations. Propagation speed, field profiles, and supporting currents for this magnetic structure are shown to be consistent with a magnetosonic soliton. Coincidentally, this structure and its evolution are typical of foot structures observed in perpendicular shock reformation. To reconcile these two observations, we propose, for the first time, that shock reformation can be explained as the result of the formation, growth, and subsequent transition to a supercritical shock of a magnetosonic soliton. This argument is further supported by the remarkable agreement found between the period of the soliton evolution cycle and classical reformation results. This new result suggests that the unique properties of solitons can be used to shed new light on the long-standing issue of shock nonstationarity and its role on particle acceleration.",0
20175,1,"Fractional Fowler-Nordheim Law for Field Emission from Rough Surface with Nonparabolic Energy Dispersion The theories of field electron emission from perfectly planar and smooth canonical surfaces are well understood, but they are not suitable for describing emission from rough, irregular surfaces arising in modern nanoscale electron sources. Moreover, the existing models rely on Sommerfeld's free-electron theory for the description of electronic distribution which is not a valid assumption for modern materials with nonparabolic energy dispersion. In this paper, we derive analytically a generalized Fowler-Nordheim (FN) type equation that takes into account the reduced space-dimensionality seen by the quantum mechanically tunneling electron at a rough, irregular emission surface. We also consider the effects of non-parabolic energy dispersion on field-emission from narrow-gap semiconductors and few-layer graphene using Kane's band model. The traditional FN equation is shown to be a limiting case of our model in the limit of a perfectly flat surface of a material with parabolic dispersion. The fractional-dimension parameter used in this model can be experimentally calculated from appropriate current-voltage data plot. By applying this model to experimental data, the standard field-emission parameters can be deduced with better accuracy than by using the conventional FN equation.",0

20356,1,"Causal network discovery by iterative conditioning: comparison of algorithms Estimating causal interactions in complex networks is an important problem encountered in many fields of current science. While a theoretical solution for detecting the graph of causal interactions has been previously formulated in the framework of prediction improvement, it generally requires the computation of high-dimensional information functionals -- a situation invoking the curse of dimensionality with increasing network size. Recently, several methods have been proposed to alleviate this problem, based on iterative procedures for assessment of conditional (in)dependences. In the current work, we bring a comparison of several such prominent approaches. This is done both by theoretical comparison of the algorithms using a formulation in a common framework, and by numerical simulations including realistic complex coupling patterns. The theoretical analysis shows that the algorithms are strongly related; including one algorithm being in particular situations equivalent to the first phase of another. Moreover, numerical simulations suggest that the accuracy of most of the algorithms is under suitable parameter choice almost indistinguishable. However, particularly for large networks there are substantial differences in their computational demands, suggesting some of the algorithms are relatively more efficient in the case of sparse networks, while other perform better in the case of dense networks. The most recent variant of the algorithm by Runge et al. then provides a promising speedup particularly for large sparse networks, albeit appears to lead to a substantial decrease in accuracy in some scenarios. Based on the analysis of the reviewed algorithms, we propose a hybrid approach that provides competitive results both concerning computational efficiency and accuracy.",0
20475,1,"An efficient $k$-means-type algorithm for clustering datasets with incomplete records The $k$-means algorithm is the most popular nonparametric clustering method in use, but cannot generally be applied to data sets with missing observations. The usual practice with such data sets is to either impute the values under an assumption of a missing-at-random mechanism or to ignore the incomplete records, and then to use the desired clustering method. We develop an efficient version of the $k$-means algorithm that allows for clustering cases where not all the features have observations recorded. Our extension is called $k_m$-means and reduces to the $k$-means algorithm when all records are complete. We also provide strategies to initialize our algorithm and to estimate the number of groups in the data set. Illustrations and simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a variety of settings and patterns of missing data. Our methods are also applied to the clustering of gamma-ray bursts and to the analysis of activation images obtained from a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment.",0

The notion of magnetic monopoles, freely moving quasiparticles fragmented from local dipole excitations, has enjoyed much success in understanding the thermodynamic, static, and transport properties of the so-called spin-ice materials. The artificial version of spin ice, where a lattice of nanoscale magnetic dipoles is sculpted out of a ferromagnetic film, provides a unique opportunity to study these unusual quasiparticles in a material-by-design approach. Here we show that the elementary excitations in the ice phase of a nano-magnetic array arranged in the pentagonal lattice are composite objects comprised of the emergent monopole and a surrounding cloud of opposite uncompensated magnetic charges.",0
20687,1,"Fast multicolor photodetectors based on graphene-contacted p-GaSe/n-InSe van der Waals heterostructures The integration of different two-dimensional materials within a multilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure offers a promising technology for realizing high performance opto-electronic devices such as photodetectors and light sources1-3. Transition metal dichalcogenides, e.g. MoS2 and WSe2, have been employed as the optically-active layer in recently developed heterojunctions. However, MoS2 and WSe2 become direct band gap semiconductors only in mono- or bilayer form4,5. In contrast, the metal monochalcogenides InSe and GaSe retain a direct bandgap over a wide range of layer thicknesses from bulk crystals down to exfoliated flakes only a few atomic monolayers thick6,7. Here we report on vdW heterojunction diodes based on InSe and GaSe: the type II band alignment between the two materials and their distinctive spectral response, combined with the low electrical resistance of transparent graphene electrodes, enable effective separation and extraction of photoexcited carriers from the heterostructure even when no external voltage is applied. Our devices are fast (< 10 {\mu}s), self-driven photodetectors with multicolor photoresponse ranging from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared and have the potential to accelerate the exploitation of two-dimensional vdW crystals by creating new routes to miniaturized optoelectronics beyond present technologies.",0
20733,1,"Multi-Path Interferometric Josephson Directional Amplifier for Qubit Readout We realize and characterize a quantum-limited, directional Josephson amplifier suitable for qubit readout. The device consists of two nondegenerate, three-wave-mixing amplifiers that are coupled together in an interferometric scheme, embedded in a printed circuit board. Nonreciprocity is generated by applying a phase gradient between the same-frequency pumps feeding the device, which plays the role of the magnetic field in a Faraday medium. Directional amplification and reflection-gain elimination are induced via wave interference between multiple paths in the system. We measure and discuss the main figures of merit of the device and show that the experimental results are in good agreement with theory. An improved version of this directional amplifier is expected to eliminate the need for bulky, off-chip isolation stages that generally separate quantum systems and preamplifiers in high-fidelity, quantum-nondemolition measurement setups.",0

Meteorological and geographical data were taken from Turkish State Meteorological Service. The ANN architecture designed is a feed-forward back-propagation model with one-hidden layer containing 21 neurons with hyperbolic tangent sigmoid as the transfer function and one output layer utilized a linear transfer function (purelin). The training algorithm used in ANN model was the Levenberg Marquand back propagation algorith (trainlm). Results obtained from ANN model were compared with measured meteorological values by using statistical methods. A correlation coefficient of 97.97 (~98%) was obtained with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.852 MJ/m^2, mean square error (MSE) of 0.725 MJ/m^2, mean absolute bias error (MABE) 10.659MJ/m^2, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.8%.

21145,1,"An Early Model of Transistors and Circuits Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) have been at the core of linear electronics from its beginnings. Although their properties can be well represented transport model equations, design and analysis approaches have, to a good extent, been limited to using current-equispaced horizontal and parallel isolines of the characteristic surface. Here, we resort to the geometrical structure imposed on BJTs behavior by the Early effect and voltage as a means to derive a simple, intuitive and more complete respective model that, though excluding cut-off and saturation regimes, can simplify the design and characterization of BJTs and respective circuits, including integrated devices. The approach involves using a beam of isolines converging at the Early voltage as the model of a BJT. The angles of the isolines, another important aspect of BJTs, are experimentally verified often to vary almost in linear fashion with the base current, endowing the proposed Early model with an intrinsic geometric nature. An experimental-numerical methodology is suggested for the Early model estimation, and applied to 12 real-world small signal NPN BJTs. Interesting results are obtained, including the identification of diverse Early voltage values for different BJT types and the observation, for the considered BJTs, of the almost linear variation of the isoline angles with the input current. A case example of transfer function estimation, as well as total harmonic distortion analysis, are also provided in order to illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology for approximating, under certain circumstances, the operation of the common emitter configuration. The proposed model also has good potential as a didactic aid in physics and electronics programs, complementing the currently adopted modeling approaches.",0

We consider a sequence of regions of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds $U_T^i\subset M_i^3$, foliated by a smooth solution to IMCF which is uniformly controlled, and if $\partial U_T^i = \Sigma_0^i \cup \Sigma_T^i$ and $m_H(\Sigma_T^i) \rightarrow 0$ then $U_T^i$ converges to a topological annulus portion of hyperbolic space with respect to $L^2$ metric convergence.

An example of a problem in that class is factorization. Our result implies that classical deterministic closed timelike curves (CTCs) cannot efficiently solve problems that lie outside of that class. Thus, in stark contrast to other CTC models, these CTCs cannot efficiently solve NP-complete problems, unless NP=UP∩coUP=coNP, which lets their existence in nature appear less implausible .

21224,1,"Opening the Black Box of Deep Neural Networks via Information Despite their great success, there is still no comprehensive theoretical understanding of learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or their inner organization. Previous work proposed to analyze DNNs in the \textit{Information Plane}; i.e., the plane of the Mutual Information values that each layer preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that the goal of the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between compression and prediction, successively, for each layer. In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Information-Plane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of the training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\emph compression} of the input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii) The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes small and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift to smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion, constrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks. (iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers. Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This can be explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly (exponentially for simple diffusion) with the information compression from the previous layer.",0
21266,1,"Programmable and scalable radio-frequency pulse sequence generator for multi-qubit quantum information experiments We present a versatile rf pulse control system that has been designed for multi-qubit quantum experiments. One instrument can be scaled to provide 32 channels of rf between 10 - 450 MHz. Synchronization can be achieved across multiple instruments. By using direct digital synthesis and custom control circuitry contained within a field-programmable gate array, sequences of transform-limited pulses can be produced. These have been used to carry out quantum gates that are able to meet fault-tolerant thresholds for single- and two-qubit gate fidelities, as published elsewhere. We have also extended the frequency to the gigahertz regime using additional mixers to address hyperfine transitions in atomic systems. The system uses an efficient memory management scheme and a low-latency communications protocol that allows pulse sequences to be updated in real-time. Together these can enable outcome-based algorithms such as quantum error correction to be executed. The system is fully programmable in C++, and other languages such as Python can be supported by the on-board CPU, offering a highly flexible platform for a wide variety of experimental systems, and has been proven in trapped-ion quantum information experiments.",0
21320,1,"Higher Order Accurate Space-Time Schemes for Computational Astrophysics -- Part I -- Finite Volume Methods As computational astrophysics comes under pressure to become a precision science, there is an increasing need to move to high accuracy schemes for computational astrophysics. Hence the need for a specialized review on higher order schemes for computational astrophysics. The focus here is on weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes and PNPM schemes. WENO schemes are higher order extensions of traditional second order finite volume schemes which are already familiar to most computational astrophysicists. DG schemes, on the other hand, evolve all the moments of the solution, with the result that they are more accurate than WENO schemes. PNPM schemes occupy a compromise position between WENO and PNPM schemes. They evolve an Nth order spatial polynomial, while reconstructing higher order terms up to Mth order. As a result, the timestep can be larger. Time-dependent astrophysical codes need to be accurate in space and time. This is realized with the help of SSP-RK (strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta) schemes and ADER (Arbitrary DERivative in space and time) schemes. The most popular approaches to SSP-RK and ADER schemes are also described. The style of this review is to assume that readers have a basic understanding of hyperbolic systems and one-dimensional Riemann solvers. Such an understanding can be acquired from a sequence of prepackaged lectures available from http://www.nd.edu/~dbalsara/Numerical-PDE-Course. We then build on this understanding to give the reader a practical introduction to the schemes described here. The emphasis is on computer-implementable ideas, not necessarily on the underlying theory, because it was felt that this would be most interesting to most computational astrophysicists.",0

In contrast with standard methods, the surrogate data used here are realisations of a non-stationary stochastic process, preserving both the amplitude and time-frequency distributions of original data.

21624,1,"Subsampling scaling: a theory about inference from partly observed systems In real-world applications, observations are often constrained to a small fraction of a system. Such spatial subsampling can be caused by the inaccessibility or the sheer size of the system, and cannot be overcome by longer sampling. Spatial subsampling can strongly bias inferences about a system's aggregated properties. To overcome the bias, we derive analytically a subsampling scaling framework that is applicable to different observables, including distributions of neuronal avalanches, of number of people infected during an epidemic outbreak, and of node degrees. We demonstrate how to infer the correct distributions of the underlying full system, how to apply it to distinguish critical from subcritical systems, and how to disentangle subsampling and finite size effects. Lastly, we apply subsampling scaling to neuronal avalanche models and to recordings from developing neural networks. We show that only mature, but not young networks follow power-law scaling, indicating self-organization to criticality during development.",0
21643,1,"Van der Waals interaction between a moving nano-cylinder and a liquid thin film We study the static and dynamic interaction between a horizontal cylindrical nano-probe and a thin liquid film. The effects of the physical and geometrical parameters, with a special focus on the film thickness, the probe speed, and the distance between the probe and the free surface are analyzed. Deformation profiles have been computed numerically from a Reynolds lubrication equation, coupled to a modified Young-Laplace equation, which takes into account the probe/liquid and the liquid/substrate non-retarded van der Waals interactions. We have found that the film thickness and the probe speed have a significant effect on the threshold separation distance below which the jump-to-contact instability is triggered. These results encourage the use of horizontal cylindrical nano-probes to scan thin liquid films, in order to determine either the physical or geometrical properties of the latter, through the measurement of interaction forces.",0
21678,1,"Identifying Excessively Rounded or Truncated Data All data are digitized, and hence are essentially integers rather than true real numbers. Ordinarily this causes no difficulties since the truncation or rounding usually occurs below the noise level. However, in some instances, when the instruments or data delivery and storage systems are designed with less than optimal regard for the data or the subsequent data analysis, the effects of digitization may be comparable to important features contained within the data. In these cases, information has been irrevocably lost in the truncation process. While there exist techniques for dealing with truncated data, we propose a straightforward method that will allow us to detect this problem before the data analysis stage. It is based on an optimal histogram binning algorithm that can identify when the statistical structure of the digitization is on the order of the statistical structure of the data set itself.",0

SPARC spans a broad range of morphologies (S0 to Irr), luminosities (~5 dex), and surface brightnesses (~4 dex). We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of stellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass-HI mass relation and the stellar radius-HI radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while the HI mass-radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models and quantify the ratio of baryonic-to-observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for different characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) at [3.6]. Assuming M/L=0.5 Msun/Lsun (as suggested by stellar population models) we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total luminosity, (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies roughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars in line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity and surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly maximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These basic properties are lost for low values of M/L=0.2 Msun/Lsun as suggested by the DiskMass survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is M/L=0.7 Msun/Lsun at [3.6].

21803,1,"Quardratic Electromechanical Strain in Silicon Investigated by Scanning Probe Microscopy Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is a powerful tool widely used to characterize piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity at the nanoscale. However, it is necessary to distinguish microscopic mechanisms between piezoelectricity and non-piezoelectric contributions measured by PFM. In this work, we systematically investigate the first and second harmonic apparent piezoresponses of silicon wafer in both vertical and lateral modes, and we show that it exhibits apparent electromechanical response that is quadratic to the applied electric field, possibly arising from ionic electrochemical dipoles induced by the charged probe. As a result, the electromechanical response measured is dominated by the second harmonic response in vertical mode, and its polarity can be switched by the DC voltage with evolving coercive field and maximum amplitude, in sharp contrast with typical ferroelectric materials we used as control. The ionic activity in silicon is also confirmed by scanning thermo-ionic microscopy (STIM) measurement, and this work points toward a set of methods to distinguish true piezoelectricity from the apparent ones.",0
21886,1,"Redundancy and synergy in dual decompositions of mutual information gain and information loss Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a nonnegative mutual information decomposition, based on the construction of information gain lattices, which allows separating the information that a set of variables contains about another into components interpretable as the unique information of one variable, or redundant and synergy components. In this work we extend the framework of Williams and Beer (2010) focusing on the lattices that underpin the decomposition. We generalize the type of constructible lattices and examine the relations between the terms in different lattices, for example relating bivariate and trivariate decompositions. We point out that, in information gain lattices, redundancy components are invariant across decompositions, but unique and synergy components are decomposition-dependent. Exploiting the connection between different lattices we propose a procedure to construct, in the general multivariate case, information decompositions from measures of synergy or unique information. We introduce an alternative type of mutual information decompositions based on information loss lattices, with the role and invariance properties of redundancy and synergy components exchanged with respect to gain lattices. We study the correspondence between information gain and information loss lattices and we define dual decompositions that allow overcoming the intrinsic asymmetry between invariant and decomposition-dependent components, which hinders the consistent joint characterization of synergy and redundancy.",0

Many theoretical studies have predicted the anisotropic optical properties of BP, but the direct experimental quantification remains challenging. The difficulties stem from the ease of BP's degradation when exposed to air in ambient conditions, and from the indirect nature of conventional approaches that are subject to large measurement uncertainties. This work reports a direct investigation of the birefringent optical constants of micrometer-thick BP samples with picosecond (ps) interferometry, over the wavelength range from 780 to 890 nm. In this ps-interferometry approach, an ultrathin (5 nm) platinum layer for launching acoustic waves naturally protects the BP flake from degradation. The birefringent optical constants of BP for light polarization along the two primary crystalline orientations, zigzag and armchair, are directly obtained via fitting the attenuated Brillouin scattering signals. A bi-exponential model is further proposed to analyze the BS signals for a random incident light polarization. The BP experimental results and the associated measurement sensitivity analysis demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the ps-interferometry approach for capturing the polarization-dependent optical properties of birefringent materials.",0

A derived tuning-free model, supported with experiments, reveals the underlying spectral content of the power fluctuations of a wind farm. It contains two power-law trends and oscillations in the relatively low- and high-frequency ranges. The former is mostly due to the turbulent interaction between the flow and the turbine properties; whereas the latter is due to the advection between turbine pairs. The spectral wind-farm scale power fluctuations $\Phi_P$ exhibits a power-law decay proportional to $f^{-5/3-2}$ in the region corresponding to the turbulence inertial subrange and at relatively large scales, $\Phi_P\sim f^{-2}$.

Then the first and quite non--trivial problem consists in the determination of an ergodic phase--space distribution which reproduces this $n(E)$. In this work we present a very extensive and accurate numerical solution of such DARKexp problem for systems with cored mass density and finite size. This solution holds throughout the energy interval $\Phi(0)\le E\le 0$ and is double--valued for a certain interval of $\beta$. The size of the system represents a unique identifier for each member of this solution family and diverges as $\beta$ approaches a specific value.

22541,1,"Topological engineering of interfacial optical Tamm states for highly-sensitive near-singular-phase optical detection We developed planar multilayered photonic-plasmonic structures, which support topologically protected optical states on the interface between metal and dielectric materials, known as optical Tamm states. Coupling of incident light to the Tamm states can result in perfect absorption within one of several narrow frequency bands, which is accompanied by a singular behavior of the phase of electromagnetic field. In the case of near-perfect absorptance, very fast local variation of the phase can still be engineered. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate how these drastic phase changes can improve sensitivity of optical sensors. A planar Tamm absorber was fabricated and used to demonstrate remote near-singular-phase temperature sensing with an over an order of magnitude improvement in sensor sensitivity and over two orders of magnitude improvement in the figure of merit over the standard approach of measuring shifts of resonant features in the reflectance spectra of the same absorber. Our experimentally demonstrated phase-to-amplitude detection sensitivity improvement nearly doubles that of state-of-the-art nano-patterned plasmonic singular-phase detectors, with further improvements possible via more precise fabrication. Tamm perfect absorbers form the basis for robust planar sensing platforms with tunable spectral characteristics, which do not rely on low-throughput nano-patterning techniques.",0

22728,1,"Collision-induced evaporation of water clusters and contribution of momentum transfer The evaporation of water molecules from high-velocity argon atoms impinging on protonated water clusters has been computationally investigated using molecular dynamics simulations with the reactive OSS2 potential to model water clusters and the ZBL pair potential to represent their interaction with the projectile. Swarms of trajectories and an event-by-event analysis reveal the conditions under which a specific number of molecular evaporation events is found one nanosecond after impact, thereby excluding direct knockout events from the analysis. These simulations provide velocity distributions that exhibit two main features, with a major statistical component arising from a global redistribution of the collision energy into intermolecular degrees of freedom, and another minor but non-ergodic feature at high velocities. The latter feature is produced by direct impacts on the peripheral water molecules and reflects a more complete momentum transfer. These two components are consistent with recent experimental measurements and confirm that electronic processes are not explicitly needed to explain the observed non-ergodic behavior.",0

In the former case, we show that the implementation of edgelike states can be extended to other geometries, such as tilted square lattices. In the latter case, we suggest using the winding number associated to the angular momentum as a synthetic dimension.",0
23014,1,"Using Adjacent Data Retransmission to Improve the Transmission Efficiency of Multi-hop Relay Networks Data transmission systems are widely used in various aspects of life, industry, research and other fields. Transmission systems have different characteristics for different application scenarios. Many of them require multi-hop transmission to extend the transmission range, such as Wireless Mesh Network (WMN), Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and so on. The biggest problem of multi-hop transmission lies in that packet loss caused by bit error ratio (BER) in multiple transmission processes increases greatly, which makes end-to-end transmission reliability and bandwidth utilization decrease. This paper analyzes the impact of BER on bandwidth utilization in multi-hop relay transmission and proposes a simple and flexible transmission mechanism that is generally applicable to multi-hop transmission scenarios.",0
23121,1,"von Neumann's Formula, Measurements and the Lindblad Equation We previously remarked that when an observable A has a continuous spectrum, then von Neumann's formula for the post-measurement state needs to be extended and the correct formula ineluctably involves the resolution of the detector used in the measurement. We generalize previous results to compute the uncertainties in successive measurements of more general pairs of observables. We also show that this extended von Neumann's formula for the post-measurement state is a completely positive map and, moreover, that there is a completely-positive interpolation between the pre- and post-measurement states. Weinberg has advocated that the time-evolution during the measurement process should be modeled as an open quantum system and governed by a Lindblad equation. We verify that this is indeed the case for an arbitrary observable, A, and a fairly general class of interpolations.",0

23156,1,"The Class of Jsolated Stars We suggest that stars whose angular momentum (J) does not increase by a companion, star or planet, along their post-main sequence evolution have much lower mass loss rates along their giant branches. Their classification to a separate group can bring insight on their late evolution stages. We term these J isolated stars, or Jsolated stars. We argue that the mass loss rate of Jsolated stars is poorly determined because the mass loss rate expressions on the giant branches are empirically based mainly on stars that experience strong binary interaction, with stellar or sub-stellar companions, e.g., planetary nebula (PN) progenitors. We postulate that the average mass loss rate of Jsolated stars during their giant phases is much lower than of non-Jsolated stars. We explore some aspects of this assumption and find that such stars with an initial mass Mi~1-2Mo reach higher luminosities and radii on the upper asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and hence are more likely to swallow brown dwarfs and planets during the AGB than traditional calculations predict. This might lead to the formation of elliptical PNe and account for bright PNe in old stellar populations. We also find that under our assumption the Sun, a Jsolated star, will most likely swallow the Earth during the AGB phase.",0
23168,1,"SO(p,q)-Higgs bundles and higher Teichm\""uller components Some connected components of a moduli space are mundane in the sense that they are distinguished only by obvious topological invariants or have no special characteristics. Others are more alluring and unusual either because they are not detected by primary invariants, or because they have special geometric significance, or both. In this paper we describe new examples of such `exotic' components in moduli spaces of SO(p,q)-Higgs bundles on closed Riemann surfaces or, equivalently, moduli spaces of surface group representations into the Lie group SO(p,q). Furthermore, we discuss how these exotic components are related to the notion of positive Anosov representations recently developed by Guichard and Wienhard. We also provide a complete count of the connected components of these moduli spaces (except for SO(2,q), with q&gt; 3).",0
23182,1,"The role of master clock stability in scalable quantum information processing Experimentalists seeking to improve the coherent lifetimes of quantum bits have generally focused on mitigating decoherence mechanisms through, for example, improvements to qubit designs and materials, and system isolation from environmental perturbations. In the case of the phase degree of freedom in a quantum superposition, however, the coherence that must be preserved is not solely internal to the qubit, but rather necessarily includes that of the qubit relative to the ""master clock"" (e.g. a local oscillator) that governs its control system. In this manuscript we articulate the impact of instabilities in the master clock on qubit phase coherence, and provide tools to calculate the contributions to qubit error arising from these processes. We first connect standard oscillator phase-noise metrics to their corresponding qubit dephasing spectral densities. We then use representative lab-grade and performance-grade oscillator specifications to calculate operational fidelity bounds on trapped-ion and superconducting qubits with relatively slow and fast operation times. We discuss the relevance of these bounds for quantum error correction in contemporary experiments and future large-scale quantum information systems, and discuss potential means to improve master clock stability.",0

In the way, this theory was constructed adopting certain supposed processes imitating classical computer gates. As for optical as well as magnetic systems, those gates are obtained as quantum evolutions. Despite, in certain cases they are attained as an asymptotic series of evolution effects. The current work exploits the direct sum of the evolution operator on a non-local basis for the driven bipartite Heisenberg-Ising model to construct a set of equivalent universal gates as straight evolutions for this interaction. The prescriptions to get these gates are reported as well as a general procedure to evaluate their performance.",0
23232,1,"Turbulence in Magnetized Pair Plasmas Alfv\'enic-type turbulence in strongly magnetized, low-beta pair plasmas is investigated. A coupled set of equations for the evolution of the magnetic and flow potentials are derived, covering both fluid and kinetic scales. In the fluid (MHD) range those equations are the same as for electron-ion plasmas, so turbulence at those scales is expected to be of the Alfv\'enic nature, exhibiting critical balance, dynamic alignment, and transition to a tearing mediated regime at small scales. The critical scale at which a transition to a tearing-mediated range occurs is derived, and the spectral slope in that range is predicted to be $k_\perp^{-8/3}$ (or $k_\perp^{-3}$, depending on details of the reconnecting configuration assumed). At scales below the electron (and positron) skin depth, it is argued that turbulence is dictated by a cascade of the inertial Alfv\'en wave, which we show to result in the magnetic energy spectrum $\propto k_\perp^{-11/3}$.",0
23329,1,"Recursion Operators and Tri-Hamiltonian Structure of the First Heavenly Equation of Plebanski We present first heavenly equation of Pleba&#324;ski in a two-component evolutionary form and obtain Lagrangian and Hamiltonian representations of this system. We study all point symmetries of the two-component system and, using the inverse Noether theorem in the Hamiltonian form, obtain all the integrals of motion corresponding to each variational (Noether) symmetry. We derive two linearly independent recursion operators for symmetries of this system related by a discrete symmetry of both the two-component system and its symmetry condition. Acting by these operators on the first Hamiltonian operator $J_0$ we obtain second and third Hamiltonian operators. However, we were not able to find Hamiltonian densities corresponding to the latter two operators. Therefore, we construct two recursion operators, which are either even or odd, respectively, under the above-mentioned discrete symmetry. Acting with them on $J_0$, we generate another two Hamiltonian operators $J_+$ and $J_-$ and find the corresponding Hamiltonian densities, thus obtaining second and third Hamiltonian representations for the first heavenly equation in a two-component form. Using P. Olver's theory of the functional multi-vectors, we check that the linear combination of $J_0$, $J_+$ and $J_-$ with arbitrary constant coefficients satisfies Jacobi identities. Since their skew symmetry is obvious, these three operators are compatible Hamiltonian operators and hence we obtain a tri-Hamiltonian representation of the first heavenly equation. Our well-founded conjecture applied here is that P. Olver's method works fine for nonlocal operators and our proof of the Jacobi identities and bi-Hamiltonian structures crucially depends on the validity of this conjecture.",0
23570,1,"Measuring logic complexity can guide pattern discovery in empirical systems We explore a definition of complexity based on logic functions, which are widely used as compact descriptions of rules in diverse fields of contemporary science. Detailed numerical analysis shows that (i) logic complexity is effective in discriminating between classes of functions commonly employed in modelling contexts; (ii) it extends the notion of canalisation, used in the study of genetic regulation, to a more general and detailed measure; (iii) it is tightly linked to the resilience of a function's output to noise affecting its inputs. We demonstrate its utility by measuring it in empirical data on gene regulation, digital circuitry, and propositional calculus. Logic complexity is exceptionally low in these systems. The asymmetry between ""on"" and ""off"" states in the data correlates with the complexity in a non-null way; a model of random Boolean networks clarifies this trend and indicates a common hierarchical architecture in the three systems.",0
23637,1,"Determination of kinetic parameters for 123-I thyroid uptake in healthy Japanese The purpose of this study was to compare the kinetic parameters for iodide thyroid accumulation in Japanese today with previously reported values. We determined the thyroid uptake of 123-I at 24 hours after the oral administration in healthy male Japanese without any diet restriction. The mean value was 16.1±5.4%, which was similar or rather lower than those previously reported in Japan (1958-1972). Kinetic model analysis was conducted to obtain the clearance for thyroid uptake from the blood circulation. The thyroid uptake clearance of 123-I was 0.540±0.073 ml/min, which was almost similar to those reported previously. There is no obvious difference in the thyroid uptake for 24 hours, and kinetic parameters in healthy Japanese for these 50 years. The fraction of distributed to the thyroid gland is lower than the ICRP reference man, and such difference must be taken into consideration to estimate the radiation exposure upon Fukushima accident in Japan.",0

23737,1,"Competing magnetic orders and spin liquids in two- and three-dimensional kagome systems: Pseudofermion functional renormalization group perspective Quantum magnets on kagome lattice geometries in two and three spatial dimensions are archetypal examples of spin systems in which geometric frustration inhibits conventional magnetic ordering and instead benefits the emergence of long-range entangled spin liquids at low temperature. Here we employ a recently developed pseudofermion functional renormalization group (pf-FRG) approach to study the low-temperature quantum magnetism of kagome and hyperkagome spin systems with exchange interactions beyond the nearest-neighbor coupling. We find that next-nearest-neighbor couplings stabilize a variety of magnetic orders as well as induce additional spin liquid regimes, giving rise to rather rich phase diagrams, which we characterize in detail. On a technical level, we find that the pf-FRG approach is in excellent quantitative agreement with high-temperature series expansions over their range of validity and it exhibits a systematic finite-size convergence in the temperature regime below. We discuss notable advantages and some current limitations of the pf-FRG approach in the ongoing search for unconventional forms of quantum magnetism.",0

Specifically, we present an empirical description of the distance distribution, focusing on characteristic changes of its shape with increasing embedding dimension. Based on our results, we recommend selecting the recurrence threshold adaptively according to a fixed quantile of this distribution. We highlight the advantages of this strategy over other previously suggested approaches by discussing the performance of selected RQA measures in detecting chaos--chaos transitions in some prototypical model system.",0

The search exploits the AS2UDS continuum survey, which covers ~50 arcmin$^2$ of the sky towards 695 luminous ($S_{870}\gtrsim1$mJy) submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), selected from the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS) 0.96deg$^2$ Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) field. We detect ten candidate line emitters, with an expected false detection rate of ten percent. All of these line emitters correspond to 870$\mu$m continuum-detected sources in AS2UDS. The emission lines in two emitters appear to be high-J CO, but the remainder have multi-wavelength properties consistent with [CII] from $z\simeq4.5$ galaxies. Using our sample, we place a lower limit of $>5\times10^{-6}$Mpc$^{-3}$ on the space density of luminous ($L_{\rm IR} \simeq 10^{13}$Lsun) SMGs at $z=4.40$-$4.66$, suggesting $\ge7$percent of SMGs with $S_{870\mu{\rm m}}\gtrsim1$mJy lie at $4<z<5$. From stacking the high-resolution ($\sim0.15""$ full-width half maximum) ALMA $870\mu$m imaging, we show that the [CII] line emission is more extended than the continuum dust emission, with an average effective radius for the [CII] of $r_{\rm e} = 1.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$kpc compared to $r_{\rm e} = 1.0\pm0.1$kpc for the continuum (rest-frame $160\mu$m). By fitting the far-infrared photometry for these galaxies from $100$-$870\mu$m, we show that SMGs at $z\sim4.5$ have a median dust temperature of $T_{\rm d}=55\pm4$K. This is systematically warmer than $870\mu$m-selected SMGs at $z\simeq2$, which typically have temperatures around $35$K. These $z\simeq4.5$ SMGs display a steeper trend in the luminosity-temperature plane than $z\le2$ SMGs.

24104,1,"Stable high-temperature paramagnons in a three-dimensional antiferromagnet near quantum criticality: Application to TlCuCl3 The complete set of hallmarks of the three-dimensional antiferromagnet near the quantum critical point has been recently observed in the spin dimer compound TlCuCl3. Nonetheless, the mechanism, responsible for several distinct features of the experimental data, has remained a puzzle, namely: (i) the paramagnons exhibit remarkable robustness to thermal damping and are stable up to high temperatures, where kBT is comparable with the excitation energy; and (ii) the width to mass ratios of the high-temperature paramagnons are, within the error bars, equal to that of the low-temperature amplitude (or Higgs) mode. We propose such a mechanism and identify two principal factors contributing to the scaling between width to mass ratios of the paramagnon and the amplitude mode: (i) the emergence of the thermal mass scale reorganizing the paramagnon decay processes, and (ii) substantial renormalization of the multimagnon interactions by thermal fluctuations. The study is carried out for the general case of a D=3+1 quantum antiferromagnet within the framework of the φ4 model using the hybrid Callan-Symanzik + Wilson thermal renormalization group method. Our approach is tested by demonstrating a good quantitative agreement with available experimental data across the phase diagram of TlCuCl3.",0

24680,1,"Surface density: a new parameter in the fundamental metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies Star-forming galaxies display a close relation among stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (or molecular-gas mass). This is known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) (or molecular-gas FMR), and it has a profound implication on models of galaxy evolution. However, there still remains a significant residual scatter around the FMR. We show here that a fourth parameter, the surface density of stellar mass, reduces the dispersion around the molecular-gas FMR. In a principal component analysis of 29 physical parameters of 41,338 star-forming galaxies, the surface density of stellar mass is found to be the fourth most important parameter. The new four-dimensional (4D) fundamental relation forms a tighter hypersurface that reduces the metallicity dispersion to 50% of that of the molecular-gas FMR. We suggest that future analyses and models of galaxy evolution should consider the FMR in a 4D space that includes surface density. The dilution time scale of gas inflow and the star-formation efficiency could explain the observational dependence on surface density of stellar mass. AKARI is expected to play an important role in shedding light on the infrared properties of the new 4D FMR.",0
24696,1,"Computational investigation of interstitial neon diffusion in pure hematite Multi-scale simulations were used to investigate the neon diffusivity in hematite for thermochronometry applications. Analyses of the magnetic, electronic, and structural properties of antiferromagnetic α-Fe2O3 are reported.

The minimum path energy of Ne migration between interstitial sites, and its position at the transition state, are determined by the climbing image-Nudged Elastic Band method (CI-NEB). Finally, these microscopic output data are used as inputs to a homemade code, based on Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms, in order to calculate the effective activation enthalpy and the diffusivity at infinite temperature for Ne in hematite. The Ne diffusion coefficient in pure hematite is calculated according to:  D=9.78×10−3(cm2/s)exp(−2.42eVkBT) This formula shows very high retentivity of hematite relative to Ne at surface temperatures, and opens new geological dating fields.",0
25007,1,"YACS - Progression Towards Isoparametric 2.5D Finite Elements YACS is a 2.5D finite element method solver capable of solving for the full 3D eigenfrequency spectra of resonant axisymmetric structures while reducing the computational problem to a 2D rotation plane. Prior studies and benchmarks, comparing YACS to well known commercial 3D and 2D applications, already demonstrated its capabilities of performing fast optimizations of geometries, due to its minimal computational overhead. However, because of the first order elements and basis functions used for approximation of the domain and field, this solving speed advantage vastly diminishes when targeting higher accuracies. In order to circumvent these issues, YACS was upgraded to support arbitrary order basis functions and curved meshes, leading to, but not limited to, isoparametric finite elements. This led to distinct performance and convergence improvements, especially when considering curved geometries, ideally representable by a polynomial mapping, e.g. when choosing a cavity geometry parametrization based on splines.",0
25166,1,"Asymmetric lasing at spectral singularities Scattering coefficients can diverge at spectral singularities. In such situation, the stationary solution becomes a laser solution with outgoing waves only. We explore a parity-time (PT)-symmetric non-Hermitian two-arm Aharonov-Bohm interferometer consisting of three coupled resonators enclosing synthetic magnetic flux. The synthetic magnetic flux does not break the PT symmetry, which protects the symmetric transmission. The features and conditions of symmetric, asymmetric, and unidirectional lasing at spectral singularities are discussed. We elucidate that lasing affected by the interference is asymmetric; asymmetric lasing is induced by the interplay between the synthetic magnetic flux and the system's non-Hermiticity. The product of the left and right transmissions is equal to that of the reflections. Our findings reveal that the synthetic magnetic flux affects light propagation, and the results can be applied in the design of lasing devices.",0

25350,1,"Symmetries of categorical representations and the quantum Ng\^o action We observe that all classical Hamiltonian systems coming from the invariant polynomials on a reductive Lie algebra g can be integrated in a universal way. This is a consequence of Ng\^o's action of the group scheme J of regular centralizers in G on all centralizers: the Hamiltonian flows associated to invariant polynomials integrate to an action of J as commutative symplectic groupoid. We quantize the Ng\^o action, providing a universal integration for all quantum Hamiltonian systems coming from the center Z=Z(Ug) of the enveloping algebra. Namely we extend Kostant's Whittaker description of Z to the action of a commutative quantum groupoid Wh, the bi-Whittaker Hamiltonian reduction of $D_G$, which also integrates all quantum Hamiltonian systems coming from the action of Z. These actions come from a braided tensor functor, the quantum Ng\^o map, from the W-category (modules for Wh) to adjoint-equivariant D-modules on G, giving a categorical family of G-invariant commuting operators on any strong G-category. This action also leads to a notion of Langlands parameters for categorical representations of G, refined central character for character sheaves, and a new symmetry of homology of character varieties. We derive our construction as the Langlands dual form of a simple symmetry principle for groupoids. Namely the symmetric monoidal category of equivariant sheaves (modules for the groupoid algebra) acts centrally on the corresponding convolution category. In particular modules for the nil-Hecke algebra for any Kac-Moody group act centrally on the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke category.

This provides further evidence that the rates derived from the QM treatment are appropriate to be used when modelling recombination through Rydberg cascades, an important process in understanding the state of material in the early universe. The rates for $\Delta\ell=\pm1$ derived from the QM formalism diverge when integrated to sufficiently large impact parameter, $b$. Further to the empirical limits to the $b$ integration suggested by Pengelly & Seaton, MNRAS 127, 165 (1964), we suggest that the fundamental issue causing this divergence in the theory is that it does not fully cater for the finite time taken for such distant collisions to complete.",0

25812,1,"Vortex formation and dynamics in two-dimensional driven-dissipative condensates We investigate the real-time evolution of lattice bosons in two spatial dimensions whose dynamics is governed by a Markovian quantum master equation. We employ the Wigner-Weyl phase space quantization and derive the functional integral for open quantum many-body systems that determines the time evolution of the Wigner function. Using the truncated Wigner approximation, in which quantum fluctuations are only taken into account in the initial state whereas the dynamics is governed by classical evolution equations, we study the buildup of long-range correlations due to the action of non-Hermitean quantum jump operators that constitute a mechanism for dissipative cooling. Starting from an initially disordered state corresponding to a vortex condensate, the dissipative process results in the annihilation of vortex-antivortex pairs and the establishment of quasi-long-range order at late times. We observe that a finite vortex density survives the cooling process, which disagrees with the analytically constructed vortex-free Bose-Einstein condensate at asymptotic times. This indicates that quantum fluctuations beyond the truncated Wigner approximation need to be included to fully capture the physics of dissipative Bose-Einstein condensation.",0
25918,1,"Machine learning algorithms based on generalized Gibbs ensembles Machine learning algorithms often take inspiration from established results and knowledge from statistical physics. A prototypical example is the Boltzmann machine algorithm for supervised learning, which utilizes knowledge of classical thermal partition functions and the Boltzmann distribution. Recently, a quantum version of the Boltzmann machine was introduced by Amin, et. al., however, non-commutativity of quantum operators renders the training process by minimizing a cost function inefficient. Recent advances in the study of non-equilibrium quantum integrable systems, which never thermalize, have lead to the exploration of a wider class of statistical ensembles. These systems may be described by the so-called generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE), which incorporates a number of ""effective temperatures"". We propose that these GGE's can be successfully applied as the basis of a Boltzmann-machine-like learning algorithm, which operates by learning the optimal values of effective temperatures. We show that the GGE algorithm is an optimal quantum Boltzmann machine: it is the only quantum machine that circumvents the quantum training-process problem. We apply a simplified version of the GGE algorithm, where quantum effects are suppressed, to the classification of handwritten digits in the MNIST database. While lower error rates can be found with other state-of-the-art algorithms, we find that our algorithm reaches relatively low error rates while learning a much smaller number of parameters than would be needed in a traditional Boltzmann machine, thereby reducing computational cost.",0
25934,1,"Influence of turbulent mixing on critical behavior of directed percolation process: Effect of compressibility Universal behavior is a typical emergent feature of critical systems. A paramount model of the nonequilibrium critical behavior is the directed bond percolation process that exhibits an active-to-absorbing state phase transition in the vicinity of a percolation threshold. Fluctuations of the ambient environment might affect or destroy the universality properties completely. In this work, we assume that the random environment can be described by means of compressible velocity fluctuations. Using field-theoretic models and renormalization group methods, we investigate large-scale and long-time behavior. Altogether, 11 universality classes are found, out of which 4 are stable in the infrared limit and thus macroscopically accessible. In contrast to the model without velocity fluctuations, a possible candidate for a realistic three-dimensional case, a regime with relevant short-range noise, is identified. Depending on the dimensionality of space and the structure of the turbulent flow, we calculate critical exponents of the directed percolation process. In the limit of the purely transversal random force, critical exponents comply with the incompressible results obtained by previous authors. We have found intriguing nonuniversal behavior related to the mutual effect of compressibility and advection.",0

The positive feedback from students and the stability of the platform lead to further development of the concept. This year, students accessed the platform in parallel while they analyzed the data recorded by demonstrated experiments live in the lecture hall. The platform is based on experience in the development of professional analysis tools. It combines core technologies from previous projects: an object-oriented C++ library, a modular data-driven analysis flow, and visual analysis steering. We present the platform and discuss its benefits in the context of teaching based on surveys that are conducted each semester.",0
26400,1,Complex chemistry with complex compounds In recent years gas-phase chemical studies assisted by physical pre-separation allowed for the investigation of fragile single molecular species by gas-phase chromatography. The latest success with the heaviest group 6 transactinide seaborgium is highlighted. The formation of a very volatile hexacarbonyl compound Sg(CO)6 was observed similarly to its lighter homologues molybdenum and tungsten. The interactions of these gaseous carbonyl complex compounds with quartz surfaces were investigated by thermochromatography. Second-generation experiments are under way to investigate the intramolecular bond between the central metal atom of the complexes and the ligands addressing the influence of relativistic effects in the heaviest compounds. Our contribution comprises some aspects of the ongoing challenging experiments as well as an outlook towards other interesting compounds related to volatile complex compounds in the gas phase.,0
26483,1,"Flutter and divergence instability in the Pfluger column: experimental evidence of the Ziegler destabilization paradox Flutter instability in elastic structures subject to follower load, the most important cases being the famous Beck's and Pfluger's columns (two elastic rods in a cantilever configuration, with an additional concentrated mass at the end of the rod in the latter case), have attracted, and still attract, a thorough research interest. In this field, the most important issue is the validation of the model itself of follower force, a nonconservative action which was harshly criticized and never realized in practice for structures with diffused elasticity. An experimental setup to introduce follower tangential forces at the end of an elastic rod was designed, realized, validated, and tested, in which the follower action is produced by exploiting Coulomb friction on an element (a freely-rotating wheel) in sliding contact against a flat surface (realized by a conveyor belt). It is therefore shown that follower forces can be realized in practice and the first experimental evidence is given for both the flutter and divergence instabilities occurring in the Pfluger's column. In particular, load thresholds for the two instabilities are measured and the detrimental effect of dissipation on the critical load for flutter is experimentally demonstrated, while a slight increase in load is found for the divergence instability. The presented approach to follower forces discloses new horizons for testing self-oscillating structures and for exploring and documenting dynamic instabilities possible when nonconservative loads are applied.",0

These singular vectors are constructed by applying screening operators to Fock module highest weight vectors. The action of the screening operators is then explicitly evaluated in terms of Jack symmetric functions and their skew analogues. The resulting formulae depend on sequences of pairs of integers that completely determine the Fock module as well as the Jack symmetric functions.",0

Using the method explained in ""On non-commutativity in quantum theory (I): from classical to quantum probability"", we analyze two toy models which exhibit non-commutativity between the corresponding position and velocity random variables. In particular, using ordinary probability theory, we study the kinematics of a point-like particle jumping at random over a discrete random space.

26553,1,"A Hamiltonian perturbation theory for the nonlinear Vlasov equation The nonlinear Vlasov equation contains the full nonlinear dynamics and collective effects of a given Hamiltonian system. The linearized approximation is not valid for a variety of interesting systems, nor is it simple to extend to higher order. It is also well-known that the linearized approximation to the Vlasov equation is invalid for long times, due to its inability to correctly capture fine phase space structures. We derive a perturbation theory for the Vlasov equation based on the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the phase space evolution. We obtain an explicit perturbation series for a dressed Hamiltonian applicable to arbitrary systems whose dynamics can be described by the nonlinear Vlasov equation.",0
26582,1,"Covariance and correlation estimators in bipartite complex systems with a double heterogeneity We present a weighted estimator of the covariance and correlation in bipartite complex systems with a double layer of heterogeneity. The advantage provided by the weighted estimators lies in the fact that the unweighted sample covariance and correlation can be shown to possess a bias. Indeed, such a bias affects real bipartite systems, and, for example, we report its effects on two empirical systems, one social and the other biological. On the contrary, our newly proposed weighted estimators remove the bias and are better suited to describe such systems.",0
26628,1,"Robust Wrapping-free Phase Retrieval Method Based on Weighted Least-square Method For many profilometry techniques, phase unwrapping is one of the most challenging process. In order to sidestep the phase unwrapping process, Perciante et. al [Appl Opt 2015; 54(10):3018-23] proposed a wrapping-free method based on the direct integration of the spatial derivatives of the patterns to retrieve the phase. But it is only applicable for the case of the phase continuity for the tested object, which means it may fail to handle fringe patterns containing complicated singularities, such as noise, shadow, shears and surface discontinuity. In view of this problems, a robust wrapping-free phase retrieval method is proposed in this paper, which is based on combined Perciante's method and weighted least-squares method. Two partial derivatives of the desired phase is obtained from the fringe patterns, meanwhile the carrier is eliminated using direct phase difference method. The phase singularities are determined using derivative variance correlation map (DVCM), and the weighting coefficient is obtained from the binary mask of the reverse DVCM. Simulations and experiments are conducted to prove the validity of the proposed method. Results are analyzed and compared with those of Perciante's method, demonstrating that the proposed method can be available for measuring objects with some kinds of singularities sources.",0

26842,1,"Pressure-induced Superconductivity in the Three-component Fermion Topological Semimetal Molybdenum Phosphide Topological semimetal, a novel state of quantum matter hosting exotic emergent quantum phenomena dictated by the non-trivial band topology, has emerged as a new frontier in condensed-matter physics. Very recently, a coexistence of triply degenerate points of band crossing and Weyl points near the Fermi level was theoretically predicted and immediately experimentally verified in single crystalline molybdenum phosphide (MoP). Here we show in this material the high-pressure electronic transport and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We report the emergence of pressure-induced superconductivity in MoP with a critical temperature Tc of about 2 K at 27.6 GPa, rising to 3.7 K at the highest pressure of 95.0 GPa studied. No structural phase transitions is detected up to 60.6 GPa from the XRD. Meanwhile, the Weyl points and triply degenerate points topologically protected by the crystal symmetry are retained at high pressure as revealed by our DFT calculations. The coexistence of three-component fermion and superconductivity in heavily pressurized MoP offers an excellent platform to study the interplay between topological phase of matter and superconductivity.",0
26861,1,"Towards Loophole-Free Optical Bell Test of CHSH Inequality Bell test had been suggested to end the long-standing debate on the EPR paradox, while the imperfections of experimental devices induce some loopholes in Bell test experiments and hence the assumption of local reality by EPR cannot be excluded with current experimental results. In optical Bell test experiments, the locality loophole can be closed easily, while the attempt of closing detection loophole requires very high efficiency of single photon detectors. Previous studies showed that the violation of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality with maximally entangled states requires the detection efficiency to be higher than 82.8 %. In this paper, we raise a modified CHSH inequality that covers all measurement events including the efficient and inefficient detections in the Bell test and prove that all local hidden models can be excluded when the inequality is violated. We find that, when non-maximally entangled states are applied to the Bell test, the lowest detection efficiency for violation of the present inequality is 66.7 %. This makes it feasible to close the detection loophole and the locality loophole simultaneously in optical Bell test of CHSH inequality.",0
27018,1,"Structural Damage Identification Using Piezoelectric Impedance Measurement with Sparse Inverse Analysis The impedance/admittance measurements of a piezoelectric transducer bonded to or embedded in a host structure can be used as damage indicator. When a credible model of the healthy structure, such as the finite element model, is available, using the impedance/admittance change information as input, it is possible to identify both the location and severity of damage. The inverse analysis, however, may be under-determined as the number of unknowns in high-frequency analysis is usually large while available input information is limited. The fundamental challenge thus is how to find a small set of solutions that cover the true damage scenario. In this research we cast the damage identification problem into a multi-objective optimization framework to tackle this challenge. With damage locations and severities as unknown variables, one of the objective functions is the difference between impedance-based model prediction in the parametric space and the actual measurements. Considering that damage occurrence generally affects only a small number of elements, we choose the sparsity of the unknown variables as another objective function, deliberately, the l0 norm. Subsequently, a multi-objective Dividing RECTangles (DIRECT) algorithm is developed to facilitate the inverse analysis where the sparsity is further emphasized by sigmoid transformation. As a deterministic technique, this approach yields results that are repeatable and conclusive. In addition, only one algorithmic parameter, the number of function evaluations, is needed. Numerical and experimental case studies demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of obtaining high-quality damage identification solutions with limited measurement information.",0

Building on recent developments in the field of spatially confined extended Hamiltonian systems, we find a fully nonlinear solution of this equation representing periodically modulated precession of a single vortex. Motions of this type have been previously seen in numerical simulations and experiments at moderately weak coupling. Our paper provides a controlled analytic prediction for trajectories of a single vortex, suggests new targets for experiments, and opens up the prospect of finding analytic multivortex solutions.",0
27082,1,"An introduction to infinite HMMs for single molecule data analysis The hidden Markov model (HMM) has been a workhorse of single molecule data analysis and is now commonly used as a standalone tool in time series analysis or in conjunction with other analyses methods such as tracking.

As a modeling tool, iHMMs can analyze sequential data without a priori setting a specific number of states as required for the traditional (finite) HMM. While the current literature on the iHMM is primarily intended for audiences in Statistics, the idea is powerful and the iHMM's breadth in applicability outside Machine Learning and Data Science warrants a careful exposition.

27110,1,"3D Snapshot Microscopy of Extended Objects Volumetric biological imaging often involves compromising high temporal resolution at the expense of high spatial resolution when popular scanning methods are used to capture 3D information. We introduce an integrated experimental and image reconstruction method for capturing dynamic 3D fluorescent extended objects as a series of synchronously measured 3D snapshots taken at the frame rate of the imaging camera. We employ multifocal microscopy (MFM) to simultaneously image at 25 focal planes and process this depth-encoded image to recover the 3D structure of extended objects, such as bacteria, using a sparsity-based reconstruction approach. The combined experimental and computational method produces image quality similar to confocal microscopy in a fraction of the acquisition time. In addition, our computational image reconstruction approach allows a simplified MFM optical design by correcting aberrations using the measured response to point sources. This ""compressive"" MFM acquisition and reconstruction method, where an image volume with roughly 8 million voxels is recovered from a single 1-megapixel captured image, enables straightforward study of dynamic processes in 3D, and as a simultaneous snapshot advances the state of the art in dynamic 3D microscopy.",0

27137,1,"Symmetry indicators and anomalous surface states of topological crystalline insulators The rich variety of crystalline symmetries in solids leads to a plethora of topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) featuring distinct physical properties, which are conventionally understood in terms of bulk invariants specialized to the symmetries at hand. While isolated examples of TCI have been identified and studied, the same variety demands a unified theoretical framework. In this work, we show how the surfaces of TCIs can be analyzed within a general surface theory with multiple flavors of Dirac fermions, whose mass terms transform in specific ways under crystalline symmetries. We identify global obstructions to achieving a fully gapped surface, which typically lead to gapless domain walls on suitably chosen surface geometries. We perform this analysis for all 32 point groups, and subsequently for all 230 space groups, for spin-orbit-coupled electrons. We recover all previously discussed TCIs in this symmetry class, including those with ""hinge"" surface states. Finally, we make connections to the bulk band topology as diagnosed through symmetry-based indicators. We show that spin-orbit-coupled band insulators with nontrivial symmetry indicators are always accompanied by surface states that must be gapless somewhere on suitably chosen surfaces. We provide an explicit mapping between symmetry indicators, which can be readily calculated, and the characteristic surface states of the resulting TCIs.",0

This method can be used for finding all optimal probe states, rather than focusing on the performance of specific states as shown in previous studies. As an example, we apply this method to find optimal probes for the channel that combines the phase-change and squeezing channels, and for generalized two-mode squeezing and mode-mixing channels. The method enables a comprehensive study of temperature effects in Gaussian parameter estimation. It has been shown that the precision in parameter estimation using single-mode states can be enhanced by increasing the temperature of the probe. We show that not only higher temperature, but also larger temperature differences between modes of a Gaussian probe state can enhance the estimation precision.",0

This extends previous results to arbitrary dimension and arbitrary (constant) symplectic structure. As a by-product we introduce and prove several concepts and results on non-standard symplectic spaces which generalize those on the standard symplectic space, namely, the symplectic spectrum, Williamson’s theorem, and Narcowich-Wigner spectra. We also show how Wigner functions on non-standard symplectic spaces behave under the action of an arbitrary linear coordinate transformation.",0
27732,1,"Geometric theory of the natural optical activity in noncentrosymmetric metals This is a PhD dissertation. Ignited by the chiral anomaly of recently discovered Weyl (semi-)metals, we study the chiral magnetic effect and the natural optical activity of noncentrosymmetric metals. Both phenomena are related to the linear-in-$\mathbf{q}$ spatial dispersion of the optical conductivity tensor, and can be calculated within the formalism of the semiclassical kinetic equation. Therefore, we calculate the dispersion of optical conductivity up to the linear order of the wave vector, in the low frequency regime, with both the semiclassical Boltzmann equation and the Kubo formula. The two different methods of calculation provide us the same result. In this result, the static and dynamic chiral magnetic effects are revealed to have different origin: one comes from topology, related to Berry monopoles, and the other has a geometric origin, which is determined by the orbital magnetic moment. The Faraday rotation of the polarization of light transmitted through a slab of the sample provides us the most direct way to measure the magnitude of dynamic chiral magnetic effect. We develop an effective medium theory for electromagnetic wave propagating through gapless nonuniform systems, to calculate macroscopic sample inhomogeneities induced corrections to the chiral magnetic conductivity. We show that, in metals with low carrier density, the way in which macroscopic fluctuations of the local conductivity affect the frequency dependent of the measured optical polarization rotation angle: by creating a sharp feature near the plasma edge, which can be detected by experiments.

The properties of these states are investigated in dependence on the basic system parameters and temperature of a thermal bath.

By utilizing hybrid electrodynamics molecular dynamics simulations we show that a global electric field of 1 GV/m or more significantly increases the stability and critical temperature of spontaneous reorientation of nanosized <100> Cu field emitters. We also show that in the studied tips the stabilizing effect of an external applied electric field is an order of magnitude greater than the destabilization caused by the field emission current. We detect the critical temperature of spontaneous reorientation using the tool that spots the changes in crystal structure. The method is compatible with techniques that consider the change in potential energy, has a wider range of applicability and allows pinpointing different stages in the reorientation processes.",0
28020,1,"Duality and free energy analyticity bounds for few-body Ising models with extensive homology rank We consider pairs of few-body Ising models where each spin enters a bounded number of interaction terms (bonds), such that each model can be obtained from the dual of the other after freezing $k$ spins on large-degree sites. Such a pair of Ising models can be interpreted as a two-chain complex with $k$ being the rank of the first homology group. Our focus is on the case where $k$ is extensive, that is, scales linearly with the number of bonds $n$. Flipping any of these additional spins introduces a homologically non-trivial defect (generalized domain wall). In the presence of bond disorder, we prove the existence of a low-temperature weak-disorder region where additional summation over the defects have no effect on the free energy density $f(T)$ in the thermodynamical limit, and of a high-temperature region where in the ferromagnetic case an extensive homological defect does not affect $f(T)$. We also discuss the convergence of the high- and low-temperature series for the free energy density, prove the analyticity of limiting $f(T)$ at high and low temperatures, and construct inequalities for the critical point(s) where analyticity is lost. As an application, we prove multiplicity of the conventionally defined critical points for Ising models on all $\{f,d\}$ tilings of the hyperbolic plane, where $df/(d+f)&gt;2$. In this case, critical temperatures differ for wired and free boundary conditions, so that $T_c^{(\mathrm{w})}&gt;T_c^{(\mathrm{f})}$.",0

Next, we improve on citation counting applying the PageRank algorithm to citations among papers. Being time-ordered, this reduces to a weighted counting of citation descendants that we call PaperRank. Similarly, we compute an AuthorRank applying the PageRank algorithm to citations among authors. These metrics quantify the impact of an author or paper taking into account the impact of those authors that cite it. Finally, we show how self- and circular- citations can be eliminated by defining a closed market of citation-coins.

We show that counterrotating terms lead to extra sidebands in the optical and mechanical spectra and to a modification of the main peak. Physically, the backaction of the measurement is due to periodic coupling of the mechanical resonator to a light-field quadrature that only contains cavity-filtered shot noise. Since this fact is independent of other degrees of freedom the resonator might be coupled to, our solution can be generalized, including to dissipatively or parametrically squeezed oscillators, as well as recent two-mode backaction-evading measurements.",0
28543,1,"Appearance and Disappearance of Quantum Correlations in Measurement-Based Feedback Control of a Mechanical Oscillator Quantum correlations between imprecision and backaction are a hallmark of continuous linear measurements. Here, we study how measurement-based feedback can be used to improve the visibility of quantum correlations due to the interaction of a laser field with a nanomechanical oscillator. Backaction imparted by the meter laser, due to radiation-pressure quantum fluctuations, gives rise to correlations between its phase and amplitude quadratures. These quantum correlations are observed in the experiment both as squeezing of the meter field fluctuations below the vacuum level in a homodyne measurement and as sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne measurement, demonstrating the common origin of both phenomena. We show that quantum feedback, i.e., feedback that suppresses measurement backaction, can be used to increase the visibility of the sideband asymmetry ratio. In contrast, by operating the feedback loop in the regime of noise squashing, where the in-loop photocurrent variance is reduced below the vacuum level, the visibility of the sideband asymmetry is reduced. This is due to backaction arising from vacuum noise in the homodyne detector. These experiments demonstrate the possibility, as well as the fundamental limits, of measurement-based feedback as a tool to manipulate quantum correlations.",0

28749,1,"Numerical prediction of the piezoelectric transducer response in the acoustic nearfield using a one-dimensional electromechanical finite difference approach We present a simple electromechanical finite difference model to study the response of a piezoelectric polyvinylidenflourid (PVDF) transducer to optoacoustic (OA) pressure waves in the acoustic nearfield prior to thermal relaxation of the OA source volume. The assumption of nearfield conditions, i.e. the absence of acoustic diffraction, allows to treat the problem using a one-dimensional numerical approach. Therein, the computational domain is modeled as an inhomogeneous elastic medium, characterized by its local wave velocities and densities, allowing to explore the effect of stepwise impedance changes on the stress wave propagation. The transducer is modeled as a thin piezoelectric sensing layer and the electromechanical coupling is accomplished by means of the respective linear constituting equations. Considering a low-pass characteristic of the full experimental setup, we obtain the resulting transducer signal. Complementing transducer signals measured in a controlled laboratory experiment with numerical simulations that result from a model of the experimental setup, we find that, bearing in mind the apparent limitations of the one-dimensional approach, the simulated transducer signals can be used very well to predict and interpret the experimental findings.",0

29072,1,"Skyrmion domain wall collision and domain wall-gated skyrmion logic Skyrmions and domain walls are significant spin textures of great technological relevance to magnetic memory and logic applications, where they can be used as carriers of information. The unique topology of skyrmions makes them display emergent dynamical properties as compared with domain walls. Some studies have demonstrated that the two topologically inequivalent magnetic objects could be interconverted by using cleverly designed geometric structures. Here, we numerically address the skyrmion domain wall collision in a magnetic racetrack by introducing relative motion between the two objects based on a specially designed junction. An electric current serves as the driving force that moves a skyrmion toward a trapped domain wall pair. We see different types of collision dynamics depending on the driving parameters.

29104,1,"Measures of spike train synchrony for data with multiple time-scales Background: Measures of spike train synchrony are widely used in both experimental and computational neuroscience. Time-scale independent and parameter-free measures, such as the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance and SPIKE-synchronization, are preferable to time-scale parametric measures, since by adapting to the local firing rate they take into account all the time-scales of a given dataset. New Method: In data containing multiple time-scales (e.g. regular spiking and bursts) one is typically less interested in the smallest time-scales and a more adaptive approach is needed. Here we propose the A-ISI-distance, the A-SPIKE-distance and A-SPIKE-synchronization, which generalize the original measures by considering the local relative to the global time-scales. For the A-SPIKE-distance we also introduce a rate-independent extension called the RIA-SPIKE-distance, which focuses specifically on spike timing. Results: The adaptive generalizations A-ISI-distance and A-SPIKE-distance allow to disregard spike time differences that are not relevant on a more global scale. A-SPIKE-synchronization does not any longer demand an unreasonably high accuracy for spike doublets and coinciding bursts. Finally, the RIA-SPIKE-distance proves to be independent of rate ratios between spike trains. Comparison with Existing Methods: We find that compared to the original versions the A-ISI-distance and the A-SPIKE-distance yield improvements for spike trains containing different time-scales without exhibiting any unwanted side effects in other examples. A-SPIKE-synchronization matches spikes more efficiently than SPIKE-Synchronization. Conclusions: With these proposals we have completed the picture, since we now provide adaptive generalized measures that are sensitive to rate only (A-ISI-distance), to timing only (ARI-SPIKE-distance), and to both at the same time (A-SPIKE-distance).",0
29335,1,"A computationally efficient method to solve the Takagi-Taupin equations for a large deformed crystal We present a treatise on solving the Takagi-Taupin equations in the case of a strain field with an additional, spatially slowly varying component (owing to \emph{e.g.}~heat expansion or angular compression). We show that the presence of such a component in a typical case merely shifts the reflectivity curve as a function of wavelength or incidence angle, while having a negligible effect on its shape. On the basis of the derived result, we develop a computationally efficient method to calculate the reflectivity curve of a large deformed crystal. The validity of the method is demonstrated by comparing computed reflectivity curves with experimental ones for bent silicon wafers. A good agreement is observed.",0

The behavior of such a field at a point is investigated, with particular attention paid to the formation of topological defects. An integral to compute the number density of stationary points at a given field amplitude is constructed. We compute exact expressions for the integral in various limits and provide code to evaluate it numerically in the general case. We investigate the dependence of the number density of stationary points on the field amplitude, number of fields, and power spectrum of the individual Gaussian random fields. This work parallels the work of Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser and Szalay, who investigated the statistics of peaks of Gaussian random fields. A number of results for integrating over matrices are presented in appendices.",0
29568,1,"Full duplex communication using visible light In this work, we propose, fabricate and characterize a full duplex communication system using visible light on a single chip. Both the suspended p-n junction InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) devices and the suspended waveguides are obtained on a GaN-on-silicon platform by wafer-level processing. Two suspended p-n junction InGaN/GaN MQW devices that can both emit and detect light simultaneously are connected using suspended waveguides to form an in-plane visible light communication (VLC) system. The light that is emitted from one suspended p-n junction InGaN/GaN MQW device can induce a current in the device located at the other end of the waveguide via in-plane light coupling, thus leading to full duplex communication using visible light. This proof-of-concept in-plane VLC system paves the way towards the implementation of a full duplex communications system operating at the same frequency using visible light on a single chip.",0

29902,1,"Estimation of the Temperature Fluctuations Harshness Regarding Stability of Structures in the Nanometer Range Thermally induced distortions are a key contributor to the overall positional and pointing performance of high-stability systems. Though stability scales with temperature fluctuations, there is some hidden complexity is the subject. Firstly, not all temperature oscillations will distort the structure: fast variations will hardly propagate into the structure, little change in overall dimensions but primarily pointing errors. Conversely, slow variations will result in quasi uniform temperature fields that change dimensions, hence mainly positional errors. Secondly, there is randomness in temperature fluctuations which obscures the actual severity of a given environment: randomness occurs timewise, but also space-wise. For highly stable situations, random part of the temperature field becomes prominent, and discarding this component becomes questionable. No harshness indicator exists that could help quantifying the actual severity of a given thermal environment. It is the objective of this paper to provide some insight on the matter, and propose a simple yet efficient numerical method allowing the evaluation of actual structural response to any realistic thermal environment.",0
29915,1,"Cumulative Damage of Ultrafast Laser Pulses We demonstrate experimentally that damage threshold fluence (DTF) for fused silica changes with the number of femtosecond laser (10Hz 600Hz, 655 fs, 800nm) shots. Based on the experimental data we were able to develop a model which indicates that the change in DTF varies with number of shots logarithmically (ln^{p}) up to a critical value. Above this value, DTF approaches an asymptotic value. Both DTF for a single shot and the asymptotic value as well as the critical value where this happens are extrinsic parameters dependent on the configuration (repetition rate, pressure and geometry near or at the surface). Indications are that the power of this dependence (p) is an intrinsic parameter independent of the configuration.",0

30124,1,"Definition of Simplified Frequency-Domain Volterra Models With Quasi-Sinusoidal Input The Volterra approach to the modeling of nonlinear systems has been employed for a long time thanks to its conceptual simplicity and flexibility. Its main drawback lies in the number of coefficients, which rapidly grows with memory length and nonlinearity order. In some important cases, such as power system applications, the input signal is periodic and contains a fundamental component that is much larger with respect to the others. This peculiarity can be exploited in order to dramatically reduce the number of coefficients defining the frequency-domain Volterra model with slight drawbacks in terms of accuracy. A systematic procedure for the definition of simplified, frequency-domain models of arbitrary order is proposed. Thanks to the simplification, very high orders of nonlinearity can be managed. The proposed approach has been employed to model the behavior of two electrical devices with different amount of nonlinearity, and that of a power grid containing linear and nonlinear loads. Accuracy is discussed and compared with that obtained with a conventional Volterra model defined by a similar number of coefficients. Results show the effectiveness of the approach, which is particularly suitable to model and test voltage and current transducers as well as other ac power system devices.",0

30450,1,"Direct Observation of Nanosecond Water Exchange Dynamics at a Protein Metal Site Nanosecond ligand exchange dynamics at metal sites within proteins is essential in catalysis, metal ion transport, and regulatory metallobiochemistry. Herein we present direct observation of the exchange dynamics of water at a $Cd^{2+}$ binding site within two de novo designed metalloprotein constructs using $^{111m}$Cd perturbed angular correlation (PAC) of γ-rays and $^{113}$Cd NMR spectroscopy. The residence time of the $Cd^{2+}$ -bound water molecule is tens of nanoseconds at 20 °C in both proteins. This constitutes the first direct experimental observation of the residence time of $Cd^{2+}$ coordinated water in any system, including the simple aqua ion. A Leu to Ala amino acid substitution ∼10 Å from the $Cd^{2+}$ site affects both the equilibrium constant and the residence time of water, while, surprisingly, the metal site structure, as probed by PAC spectroscopy, remains essentially unaltered. This implies that remote mutations may affect metal site dynamics, even when structure is conserved.",0
30459,1,"Robust Bayesian target detection algorithm for depth imaging from sparse single-photon data This paper presents a new Bayesian model and associated algorithm for depth and intensity profiling using full waveforms from time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements in the limit of very low photon counts (i.e., typically less than 20 photons per pixel). The model represents each Lidar waveform as an unknown constant background level, which is combined in the presence of a target, to a known impulse response weighted by the target intensity and finally corrupted by Poisson noise. The joint target detection and depth imaging problem is expressed as a pixel-wise model selection and estimation problem which is solved using Bayesian inference. Prior knowledge about the problem is embedded in a hierarchical model that describes the dependence structure between the model parameters while accounting for their constraints. In particular, Markov random fields (MRFs) are used to model the joint distribution of the background levels and of the target presence labels, which are both expected to exhibit significant spatial correlations. An adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm including reversible-jump updates is then proposed to compute the Bayesian estimates of interest. This algorithm is equipped with a stochastic optimization adaptation mechanism that automatically adjusts the parameters of the MRFs by maximum marginal likelihood estimation. Finally, the benefits of the proposed methodology are demonstrated through a series of experiments using real data.",0
30577,1,"Material properties of $\alpha$-quartz that are relevant for its potential use in X-ray monochromators and analyzers Monochromators and analyzers for X-rays of energy $>$ 5 keV are overwhelmingly made from silicon crystals, of which large specimens of high purity and low defect density are readily available. Germanium and diamond crystals are also occasionally used. Bragg reflection of the X-rays determines their bandwidth, with backscattering reflections (with Bragg angles $\approx$ 90$^\circ$) providing the highest energy resolution along with high photon collection efficiency. The crystal lattices of all these materials share the same space group $Fd\overline{3}m$, which because of its high symmetry provides a low density of unique backscattering Bragg reflections per unit photon energy range. This is a disadvantage for solid-state studies using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and nuclear resonant scattering (NRS), for which the X-ray energy must be tuned to a specific electronic or nuclear transition. As a result, crystals with lattices of lower symmetry are being considered. $\alpha$-quartz is one of the most promising. However, data on its material properties and fabrication techniques are widely scattered, and in the vital matter of the atomic positions, great inconsistencies exist in the literature. The material properties of $\alpha$-quartz that are relevant to X-ray studies are therefore summarized and clarified here as a guide to future work.",0
30603,1,"ICON: an adaptation of infinite HMMs for time traces with drift Bayesian nonparametric methods have recently transformed emerging areas within data science. One such promising method, the infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM), generalizes the HMM which itself has become a workhorse in single molecule data analysis. The iHMM goes beyond the HMM by self-consistently learning all parameters learned by the HMM in addition to learning the number of states without recourse to any model selection steps. Despite its generality, simple features (such as drift), common to single molecule time traces, result in an over-interpretation of drift and the introduction of artifact states. Here we present an adaptation of the iHMM that can treat data with drift originating from one or many traces (e.g. FRET). Our fully Bayesian method couples the iHMM to a continuous control process (drift) self-consistently learned while learning all other quantities determined by the iHMM (including state numbers). A key advantage of this method is that all traces -regardless of drift or states visited across traces- may now be treated on an equal footing thereby eliminating user-dependent trace selection (based on drift levels), pre-processing to remove drift and post-processing model selection on state number.",0

However, the tensor product decomposition was only constructed abstractly using the GNS-representation of a $C^*$-algebraic version of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups.

30610,1,"Inferactive data analysis We describe inferactive data analysis, so-named to denote an interactive approach to data analysis with an emphasis on inference after data analysis. Our approach is a compromise between Tukey's exploratory (roughly speaking ""model free"") and confirmatory data analysis (roughly speaking classical and ""model based""), also allowing for Bayesian data analysis. We view this approach as close in spirit to current practice of applied statisticians and data scientists while allowing frequentist guarantees for results to be reported in the scientific literature, or Bayesian results where the data scientist may choose the statistical model (and hence the prior) after some initial exploratory analysis. While this approach to data analysis does not cover every scenario, and every possible algorithm data scientists may use, we see this as a useful step in concrete providing tools (with frequentist statistical guarantees) for current data scientists. The basis of inference we use is selective inference [Lee et al., 2016, Fithian et al., 2014], in particular its randomized form [Tian and Taylor, 2015a]. The randomized framework, besides providing additional power and shorter confidence intervals, also provides explicit forms for relevant reference distributions (up to normalization) through the {\em selective sampler} of Tian et al. [2016]. The reference distributions are constructed from a particular conditional distribution formed from what we call a DAG-DAG -- a Data Analysis Generative DAG. As sampling conditional distributions in DAGs is generally complex, the selective sampler is crucial to any practical implementation of inferactive data analysis. Our principal goal is in reviewing the recent developments in selective inference as well as describing the general philosophy of selective inference.",0

Furthermore, an unbiased estimate of the covariance of the new estimator is also given.",0

This coupling is especially important for nanomechanical oscillators, which are among the most promising systems for preparing macroscopic objects in quantum mechanical states. Here we exploit this coupling to derive the internal temperature of a levitated nanoparticle from measurements of its center-of-mass dynamics. For a laser-trapped silica particle in high vacuum, we find an internal temperature of 1000(60)K. The measurement and control of the internal temperature of nanomechanical oscillators is of fundamental importance because black-body emission sets limits to the coherence of macroscopic quantum states.",0

We work out several concrete applications of these general results. For instance, we pinpoint the exact condensation phase transition in the Potts antiferromagnet on the random graph, thereby improving prior approximate results (Contucci et al., 2013) [34] . Further, we prove the conjecture from Krzakala et al. (2007) [55] about the condensation phase transition in the random graph coloring problem for any number q≥3 of colors. Moreover, we prove the conjecture on the information-theoretic threshold in the disassortative stochastic block model (Decelle et al., 2011) [35] .

31146,1,"Photometric characterization of the Dark Energy Camera We characterize the variation in photometric response of the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) across its 520~Mpix science array during 4 years of operation. These variations are measured using high signal-to-noise aperture photometry of $&gt;10^7$ stellar images in thousands of exposures of a few selected fields, with the telescope dithered to move the sources around the array. A calibration procedure based on these results brings the RMS variation in aperture magnitudes of bright stars on cloudless nights down to 2--3 mmag, with &lt;1 mmag of correlated photometric errors for stars separated by $\ge20$"". On cloudless nights, any departures of the exposure zeropoints from a secant airmass law exceeding &gt;1 mmag are plausibly attributable to spatial/temporal variations in aperture corrections. These variations can be inferred and corrected by measuring the fraction of stellar light in an annulus between 6"" and 8"" diameter. Key elements of this calibration include: correction of amplifier nonlinearities; distinguishing pixel-area variations and stray light from quantum-efficiency variations in the flat fields; field-dependent color corrections; and the use of an aperture-correction proxy. The DECam response pattern across the 2-degree field drifts over months by up to $\pm7$ mmag, in a nearly-wavelength-independent low-order pattern. We find no fundamental barriers to pushing global photometric calibrations toward mmag accuracy.",0

31309,1,"The imprint of the MOND external field effect on the Oort cloud comets aphelia distribution Milgromian dynamics (MD or MOND) is a promising physical description excelling especially in galaxies. When formulated as a modified gravity theory, it leads to the so called external field effect (EFE). In the case of the solar system this means that bodies orbiting the Sun are influenced, beyond its tidal effect, by the external gravitational field of the Galaxy with magnitude $\sim2\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ and time-varying direction. Aphelia of intermediate outer Oort cloud (OC) comets ($30<X<60,~X\equiv 10^{6}/a[\text{au}]$, where $a$ is semimajor axis) are distributed non-uniformly on the celestial sphere, showing an apparent concentration around a great circle centered at Galactic longitudes $L=-45$ and 135 deg. Such non-uniformity is beyond that attributable to the classical injectors of comets, stellar encounters and the Galactic tides, as well as the expected observational biases. We investigated a hypothesis that the great circle concentration of aphelia is a consequence of the long-term action of EFE in the framework of MD. We considered exclusively quasi-linear MOND (QUMOND) theory. We built our model of the OC in MD on an analytical approximation of the QUMOND potential for a point mass in the dominant external field of constant magnitude. The model is well applicable at heliocentric distances $r\gtrsim10~000$ au. Constraints on the strength of EFE found by the analysis of the Cassini radio-tracking data were taken into account. We demonstrated characteristic imprint of the EFE on the distribution of aphelia of candidate outer OC comets that migrated down to $r=10~000$ au. By both analytical and numerical calculations, we showed that the combined effect of EFE and the Galactic tides could qualitatively account for the characteristic features seen in the observed distribution of aphelia of the outer OC comets.",0

As the original measurement-device-independent entanglement witness scheme exploits only one out of four Bell measurement outcomes for each party, a direct generalization to multipartite quantum states will inevitably cause inefficiency in entanglement detection after taking account of statistical fluctuations. To resolve this problem, we also present a way to utilize all the measurement outcomes. The scheme is efficient for multipartite entanglement detection and can be realized with state-of-the-art technologies.",0

For fixed Py thickness we observed an increase of the Gilbert damping parameter with decreasing resistivity of the Si channel. For a fixed Si doping concentration we measured an increasing Gilbert damping parameter for decreasing Py layer thickness. No increase of the Gilbert damping parameter was found Py/Si samples with an insulating interlayer.

In an electrolyte, the interface shared by the crossing fluidic channels is mathematically of zero thickness and defines the narrowest constriction in the stream of ions through the nanopore device. This novel architecture provides the possibility to design nanopore fluidic channels, particularly with a robust 3D architecture maintaining the ultimate zero thickness geometry independently of the thickness of the fluidic channels.

32222,1,"Design Analysis for Optimal Calibration of Diffusivity in Reactive Multilayers Calibration of the uncertain Arrhenius diffusion parameters for quantifying mixing rates in Zr-Al nanolaminate foils was performed in a Bayesian setting [Vohra et al., 2014]. The parameters were inferred in a low temperature regime characterized by homogeneous ignition and a high temperature regime characterized by self-propagating reactions in the multilayers. In this work, we extend the analysis to find optimal experimental designs that would provide the best data for inference. We employ a rigorous framework that quantifies the expected in- formation gain in an experiment, and find the optimal design conditions using numerical techniques of Monte Carlo, sparse quadrature, and polynomial chaos surrogates. For the low temperature regime, we find the optimal foil heating rate and pulse duration, and confirm through simulation that the optimal design indeed leads to sharper posterior distributions of the diffusion parameters. For the high temperature regime, we demonstrate potential for increase in the expected information gain of the posteriors by increasing sample size and reducing uncertainty in measurements. Moreover, posterior marginals are also produced to verify favorable experimental scenarios for this regime.",0
32507,1,"Floquet analysis of a quantum system with modulated periodic driving We consider a quantum system periodically driven with a strength which varies slowly on the scale of the driving period. The analysis is based on a general formulation of the Floquet theory relying on the extended Hilbert space. It is shown that the dynamics of the system can be described in terms of a slowly varying effective Floquet Hamiltonian that captures the long-term evolution, as well as rapidly oscillating micromotion operators. We obtain a systematic high-frequency expansion of all these operators. Generalizing the previous studies, the expanded effective Hamiltonian is now time dependent and contains extra terms appearing due to changes in the periodic driving. The same applies to the micromotion operators which exhibit a slow temporal dependence in addition to the rapid oscillations. As an illustration, we consider a quantum-mechanical spin in an oscillating magnetic field with a slowly changing direction. The effective evolution of the spin is then associated with non-Abelian geometric phases reflecting the geometry of the extended Floquet space. The developed formalism is general and also applies to other periodically driven systems, such as shaken optical lattices with a time-dependent shaking strength, a situation relevant to the cold-atom experiments.",0
32574,1,"The Shape and Size distribution of HII Regions near the percolation transition Using Shapefinders, which are ratios of Minkowski functionals, we study the morphology of neutral hydrogen (HI) density fields, simulated using semi-numerical technique (inside-out), at various stages of reionization. Accompanying the Shapefinders, we also employ the 'largest cluster statistic' (LCS), originally proposed in Klypin and Shandarin (1993), to study the percolation in both neutral and ionized hydrogen. We find that the largest ionized region is percolating below the neutral fraction $x_{HI} \lesssim 0.728$ (or equivalently $z \lesssim 9$). The study of Shapefinders reveals that the largest ionized region starts to become highly filamentary with non-trivial topology near the percolation transition. During the percolation transition, the first two Shapefinders - 'thickness' ($T$) and 'breadth' ($B$) - of the largest ionized region do not vary much, while the third Shapefinder - 'length' ($L$) - abruptly increases. Consequently, the largest ionized region tends to be highly filamentary and topologically quite complex. The product of the first two Shapefinders, $T\times B$, provides a measure of the 'cross-section' of a filament-like ionized region. We find that, near percolation, the value of $T\times B$ for the largest ionized region remains stable at $\sim 7$ Mpc$^2$ (in comoving scale) while its length increases with time. Interestingly all large ionized regions have similar cross-sections. However their length shows a power-law dependence on their volume, $L\propto V^{0.72}$, at the onset of percolation.",0

In this Letter, we establish a criterion of physical consistency for any resource theory. This criterion requires that all free operations in a given resource theory be implementable by a unitary evolution and projective measurement that are both free operations in an extended resource theory. We show that all currently proposed basis-dependent theories of coherence fail to satisfy this criterion. We further characterize the physically consistent resource theory of coherence and find its operational power to be quite limited. After relaxing the condition of physical consistency, we introduce the class of dephasing-covariant incoherent operations as a natural generalization of the physically consistent operations. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the convertibility of qubit states using dephasing-covariant operations, and we show that these conditions also hold for other well-known classes of incoherent operations.",0

32846,1,"Spin torques due to various linear spin-orbit coupling in semiconductor and graphene systems in the adiabatic limit We use the gauge formalism to investigate the current-induced spin dynamics in ferromagnetic media with spatially varying local magnetization, which is coupled to various material systems exhibiting linear spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects, such as semiconductor and graphene materials. We perform a gauge transformation to the system, and obtain a gauge field (vector potential) in the adiabatic limit, i.e., strong coupling between the spin of the conduction electrons to the magnetization. The gauge field interacts with the applied current, resulting in a current-driven effective magnetic field and the corresponding spin torque acting on the magnetization of the FM media. We find that the current-driven spin orbit torque in various linear SOC systems and graphene systems can be described by a unified way. We propose a generalized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation which includes this effective field term.",0
32936,1,"Excitonic instability in optically pumped three-dimensional Dirac materials Recently it was suggested that transient excitonic instability can be realized in optically pumped two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials (DMs), such as graphene and topological insulator surface states. Here we discuss the possibility of achieving a transient excitonic condensate in optically pumped three-dimensional (3D) DMs, such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals, described by nonequilibrium chemical potentials for photoexcited electrons and holes. Similar to the equilibrium case with long-range interactions, we find that for pumped 3D DMs with screened Coulomb potential two possible excitonic phases exist, an excitonic insulator phase and the charge density wave phase originating from intranodal and internodal interactions, respectively. In the pumped case, the critical coupling for excitonic instability vanishes; therefore the two phases coexist for arbitrarily weak coupling strengths. The excitonic gap in the charge density wave phase is always the largest one. The competition between screening effects and the increase of the density of states with optical pumping results in a rich phase diagram for the transient excitonic condensate. Based on the static theory of screening, we find that under certain conditions the value of the dimensionless coupling constant screening in 3D DMs can be weaker than in 2D DMs. Furthermore, we identify the signatures of the transient excitonic condensate that could be probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, photoemission, and optical conductivity measurements. Finally, we provide estimates of critical temperatures and excitonic gaps for existing and hypothetical 3D DMs.",0
33096,1,"Detection of [O III] at z~3: A Galaxy above the Main Sequence, Rapidly Assembling its Stellar Mass We detect bright emission in the far infrared fine structure [O III] 88$\mu$m line from a strong lensing candidate galaxy, H-ATLAS J113526.3-014605, hereafter G12v2.43, at z=3.127, using the $\rm 2^{nd}$ generation Redshift (z) and Early Universe Spectrometer (ZEUS-2) at the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment Telescope (APEX). This is only the fifth detection of this far-IR line from a sub-millimeter galaxy at the epoch of galaxy assembly. The observed [O III] luminosity of $7.1\times10^{9}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{L_{\odot}}\,$ likely arises from HII regions around massive stars, and the amount of Lyman continuum photons required to support the ionization indicate the presence of $(1.2-5.2)\times10^{6}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})$ equivalent O5.5 or higher stars; where $\mu$ would be the lensing magnification factor. The observed line luminosity also requires a minimum mass of $\sim 2\times 10^{8}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,$ in ionized gas, that is $0.33\%$ of the estimated total molecular gas mass of $6\times10^{10}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,$. We compile multi-band photometry tracing rest-frame UV to millimeter continuum emission to further constrain the properties of this dusty high redshift star-forming galaxy. Via SED modeling we find G12v2.43 is forming stars at a rate of 916 $\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and already has a stellar mass of $8\times 10^{10}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,$. We also constrain the age of the current starburst to be $\leqslant$ 5 million years, making G12v2.43 a gas rich galaxy lying above the star-forming main sequence at z$\sim$3, undergoing a growth spurt and, could be on the main sequence within the derived gas depletion timescale of $\sim$66 million years.",0

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest.

33567,1,"Skewed distributions as limits of a formal evolutionary process Time series of observables measured from complex systems do often exhibit non-normal statistics, their statistical distributions (PDF's) are not gaussian and often skewed, with roughly exponential tails. Departure from gaussianity is related to the intermittent development of large-scale coherent structures. The existence of these structures is rooted into the nonlinear dynamical equations obeyed by each system, therefore it is expected that some prior knowledge or guessing of these equations is needed if one wishes to infer the corresponding PDF; conversely, the empirical knowledge of the PDF does provide information about the underlying dynamics. In this work we suggest that it is not always necessary. We show how, under some assumptions, a formal evolution equation for the PDF $p(x)$ can be written down, corresponding to the progressive accumulation of measurements of the generic observable $x$. The limiting solution to this equation is computed analytically, and shown to interpolate between some of the most common distributions, Gamma, Beta and Gaussian PDF's. The control parameter is just the ratio between the rms of the fluctuations and the range of allowed values. Thus, no information about the dynamics is required.",0
33622,1,"Monitoring Performance in Large Scale Computing Clouds with Passive Benchmarking Providers of computing services such as data science clouds need to maintain large hardware infrastructures often with thousands of nodes. Using commodity hardware leads to heterogeneous setups that differ significantly in individual nodes' performance, which must be understood to allow for accounting, strategic planning, and to identify problems and bottle-necks. Today's method of choice are active benchmarks, but they disturb normal operations and are too expensive to run continuously. They also struggle to be representative of an ever changing workload. We therefore design a passive benchmark-ing technique, which computes expressive and accurate perfor-mance metrics based on actual workloads. We prove the quality and performance benefits of our passive benchmark on a prac-tical workload in one of the world's largest scientific computing infrastructures, the CERN Computing Center.

33736,1,"Astrophysical gyrokinetics: Turbulence in pressure-anisotropic plasmas at ion scales and beyond We present a theoretical framework for describing electromagnetic kinetic turbulence in a multi-species, magnetized, pressure-anisotropic plasma. Turbulent fluctuations are assumed to be small compared to the mean field, to be spatially anisotropic with respect to it, and to have frequencies small compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. At scales above the ion Larmor radius, the theory reduces to the pressure-anisotropic generalization of kinetic reduced magnetohydrodynamics (KRMHD) formulated by Kunz et al. (2015). At scales at and below the ion Larmor radius, three main objectives are achieved. First, we analyse the linear response of the pressure-anisotropic gyrokinetic system, and show it to be a generalisation of previously explored limits. The effects of pressure anisotropy on the stability and collisionless damping of Alfvenic and compressive fluctuations are highlighted, with attention paid to the spectral location and width of the frequency jump that occurs as Alfven waves transition into kinetic Alfven waves. Secondly, we derive and discuss a general free-energy conservation law, which captures both the KRMHD free-energy conservation at long wavelengths and dual cascades of kinetic Alfven waves and ion entropy at sub-ion-Larmor scales. We show that non-Maxwellian features in the distribution function change the amount of phase mixing and the efficiency of magnetic stresses, and thus influence the partitioning of free energy amongst the cascade channels. Thirdly, a simple model is used to show that pressure anisotropy can cause large variations in the ion-to-electron heating ratio due to the dissipation of Alfvenic turbulence. Our theory provides a foundation for determining how pressure anisotropy affects the turbulent fluctuation spectra, the differential heating of particle species, and the ratio of parallel and perpendicular phase mixing in space and astrophysical plasmas.",0
33739,1,"Spin-orbit-induced resonances and threshold anomalies in a reduced dimension Fermi gas We calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with an equal mixing of the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RD-SOC) produced by an external Raman laser field. These probabilities are computed over multiple relevant energy ranges within the pseudopotential approximation. Strong scattering resonances are found whenever the incident energy approaches either a scattering threshold or a quasibound state attached to one of the energetically closed higher dispersion branches. A striking difference is demonstrated between two very different regimes set by the Raman laser intensity, namely, between scattering for the single-minimum dispersion versus the double-minimum dispersion at the lowest threshold. The presence of RD-SOC together with the Raman field fundamentally changes the scattering behavior and enables the realization of very different one-dimensional theoretical models in a single experimental setup when combined with a confinement-induced resonance.",0
33843,1,"Coulomb blockade based field-effect transistors exploiting stripe-shaped channel geometries of self-assembled metal nanoparticles Metallic nanoparticles offer possibilities to build basic electric devices with new functionality and improved performance. Due to the small volume and the resulting low self-capacitance, each single nanoparticle exhibits a high charging energy. Thus, a Coulomb-energy gap emerges during transport experiments that can be shifted by electric fields, allowing for charge transport whenever energy levels of neighboring particles match. Hence, the state of the device changes sequentially between conducting and non-conducting instead of just one transition from conducting to pinch-off as in semiconductors. To exploit this behavior for field-effect transistors, it is necessary to use uniform nanoparticles in ordered arrays separated by well-defined tunnel barriers. In this work, CoPt nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution are synthesized by colloidal chemistry. These particles are deposited via the scalable Langmuir-Blodgett technique as ordered, homogeneous monolayers onto Si/SiO2 substrates with pre-patterned gold electrodes. The resulting nanoparticle arrays are limited to stripes of adjustable lengths and widths. In such a defined channel with a limited number of conduction paths the current can be controlled precisely by a gate voltage. Clearly pronounced Coulomb oscillations are observed up to temperatures of 150 K. Using such systems as field-effect transistors yields unprecedented oscillating current modulations with on/off-ratios of around 70 %.",0
33870,1,"The formation of rings and gaps in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems: ambipolar diffusion and reconnection Radial substructures in circumstellar disks are now routinely observed by ALMA. There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such disks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps develop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of tens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD effect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately coupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current steepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic field sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic torque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly pinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates magnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion rate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger poloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically coupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop continuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more chaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in part, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal field and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the reconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The formation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has interesting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and planet formation.",0

In the nonlinear regime, or pump-depletion regime, the plasma-wave-initiated output pulse can be shown numerically to approach the same self-similar attractor solution for the corresponding laser seed. In addition, chirping the plasma wave wavelength can produce the same beneficial effects as chirping the seed wave frequency. This methodology is attractive because it avoids issues in preparing and synchronizing a frequency-shifted laser seed.",0
33888,1,"Polarization-resolved terahertz third-harmonic generation in a single-crystal superconductor NbN: Dominance of the Higgs mode beyond the BCS approximation Recent advances in time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy have unveiled that resonantly enhanced strong THz third-harmonic generation (THG) mediated by the collective Higgs amplitude mode occurs in s-wave superconductors, where charge-density fluctuations (CDFs) have been shown to also contribute to the nonlinear third-order susceptibility. It has been theoretically proposed that the nonlinear responses of Higgs and CDF exhibit essentially different polarization dependences. Here we experimentally discriminate the two contributions by polarization-resolved intense THz transmission spectroscopy for a single-crystal NbN film. The result shows that the resonant THG in the transmitted light always appears in the polarization parallel to that of the incident light with no appreciable polarization-angle dependence relative to the crystal axis. When we compare this with the theoretical calculation here with the BCS approximation and the dynamical mean-field theory for a model of NbN constructed from first principles, the experimental result strongly indicates that the Higgs mode rather than the CDF dominates the THG resonance in NbN. A possible mechanism for this is the retardation effect in the phonon-mediated pairing interaction beyond BCS.",0

34124,1,"Spatially modulated magnetic structure of EuS due to the tetragonal domain structure of SrTiO3 The combination of ferromagnets with topological superconductors or insulators allows for new phases of matter that support excitations such as chiral edge modes and Majorana fermions. EuS, a wide-bandgap ferromagnetic insulator with a Curie temperature around 16 K, and SrTiO3 (STO), an important substrate for engineering heterostructures, may support these phases. We present scanning superconducting quantum interference device measurements of EuS grown epitaxially on STO that reveal micron-scale variations in ferromagnetism and paramagnetism. These variations are oriented along the STO crystal axes and only change their configuration upon thermal cycling above the STO cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition temperature at 105 K, indicating that the observed magnetic features are due to coupling between EuS and the STO tetragonal structure. We speculate that the STO tetragonal distortions may strain the EuS, altering the magnetic anisotropy on a micron scale. This result demonstrates that local variation in the induced magnetic order from EuS grown on STO needs to be considered when engineering new phases of matter that require spatially homogeneous exchange.",0

In the EBHM, there exists a nearest-neighbor repulsion as well as the on-site repulsion. In the SSE-QMC simulation, the highest particle number at each site, nc, is also a controllable parameter, and we found that the phase diagrams depend on the value of nc.

34141,1,"Training Neural Networks Without Gradients: A Scalable ADMM Approach With the growing importance of large network models and enormous training datasets, GPUs have become increasingly necessary to train neural networks. This is largely because conventional optimization algorithms rely on stochastic gradient methods that don't scale well to large numbers of cores in a cluster setting. Furthermore, the convergence of all gradient methods, including batch methods, suffers from common problems like saturation effects, poor conditioning, and saddle points. This paper explores an unconventional training method that uses alternating direction methods and Bregman iteration to train networks without gradient descent steps. The proposed method reduces the network training problem to a sequence of minimization sub-steps that can each be solved globally in closed form. The proposed method is advantageous because it avoids many of the caveats that make gradient methods slow on highly non-convex problems. The method exhibits strong scaling in the distributed setting, yielding linear speedups even when split over thousands of cores.",0
34149,1,"Comparisons of MHD Propeller Model with Observations of Cataclysmic Variable AE Aqr We have developed a numerical MHD model of the propeller candidate star AE Aqr using axisymmetric magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We suggest that AE Aqr is an intermediate polar-type star, where the magnetic field is relatively weak and some kind of an accretion disc may form around the white dwarf. The star is in the propeller regime, and many of its observational properties are determined by the disc-magnetosphere interaction. Comparisons of the characteristics of the observed versus modelled AE Aqr star show that the model can explain observational properties of AE Aqr if the magnetic field of the star is B\approx (2.8-4.2)x10^5 G. In a representative model, the magnetic field is B\approx 3.3x10^5 G and the time-averaged accretion rate in the disc is 5.5x10^{16} g/s. The star is in the strong propeller regime, where 85 per cent of the disc mass is ejected into conically-shaped winds. The numerical model explains the rapid spin-down of AE Aqr through the outflow of angular momentum from the surface of the star into the wind. The model can explain the low accretion rate onto the star if the radiative efficiency of accretion eta\approx 0.07. The energy budget in the outflows, 2x10^{33} erg/s, is sufficient for explaining the observed flaring radiation in different wavebands. The time scale of ejections into the wind matches the short time scale variability in the light-curves of AE Aqr. Most of the matter is ejected into the wind by the magnetic force, and matter flows into the wind at relatively low velocities, 100-700 km/s. This can explain the predominantly low outflow velocities observed in the tomograms of AE Aqr.",0

34348,1,"A universal model for neuromorphic computing and learning We formulate, using the discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation (DNLS), a general approach to encode and process information based on reservoir computing. Reservoir computing is a promising avenue for realizing neuromorphic computing devices. In such computing systems, training is performed only at the output level, by adjusting the output from the reservoir with respect to a target signal. In our formulation, the reservoir can be an arbitrary physical system, driven out of thermal equilibrium by an external driving. The DNLS is a general oscillator model with broad application in physics and we argue that our approach is completely general and does not depend on the physical realisation of the reservoir. The driving, which encodes the object to be recognised, acts as a thermodynamical force, one for each node in the reservoir. Currents associated to these thermodynamical forces in turn encode the output signal from the reservoir. As an example, we consider numerically the problem of supervised learning for pattern recognition, using as reservoir a network of nonlinear oscillators.",0

Numerical simulations of the two fields are then carried out given a parameter space made of Reynolds, Prandtl, and source numbers. We find it appropriate to present and discuss the findings against Prandtl numbers given that these provide the link between viscous and magnetic diffusion. Our simulations indicate that there exists a range of Prandtl numbers for which the fields remain analogues which raises the important question of how far the analogy goes and also raises the prospect of a theory of analogue magnetism.",0

We measure the two-point autocorrelation function for this population and derive a typical halo mass of log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm halo}$) $=12.9^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$, $12.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, and $12.9^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ $h^{-1}$M$_\odot$ at $z=1-2$, $2-3$, and $3-5$, respectively. Together with the bright SMGs (S$_{850} \gtrsim 2$ mJy) and a comparison sample of less far-infrared luminous star-forming galaxies, we find a lack of dependence between spatial clustering and S$_{850}$ (or SFR), suggesting that the difference between these populations may lie in their local galactic environment. Lastly, on the scale of $\sim8-17$ kpc at $1<z<5$ we find a tentative enhancement of the clustering of TCGs over the comparison star-forming galaxies, suggesting that some faint SMGs are physically associated pairs, perhaps reflecting a merging origin in their triggering.",0
34848,1,"On the Practical Applications of Information Field Dynamics In this study we explore a new simulation scheme for partial differential equations known as Information Field Dynamics (IFD). Information field dynamics attempts to improve on existing simulation schemes by incorporating Bayesian field inference into the simulation scheme. The field inference is truly Bayesian and thus depends on a notion of prior belief. A number of results are presented, both theoretical and practical. Many small fixes and results on the general theory are presented, before exploring two general classes of simulation schemes that are possible in the IFD framework. For both, we present a set of theoretical results alongside the development of a prototype scheme. The first class of models corresponds roughly to traditional fixed-grid numerical PDE solvers. The prior Bayesian assumption in these models is that the fields are smooth, and their correlation structure does not vary between locations. For these reasons we call them translation-invariant schemes. We show the requirements for stability of these schemes, but most importantly we prove that these schemes indeed converge to the true behaviour of the field in the limit of high resolutions. Convergence had never been shown for any previous IFD scheme. We also find the error scaling of these codes and show that they implement something very analogous to a high-order finite-difference derivative approximation, which are the most elementary and well-studied numerical schemes. This is an important result, which proves the validity of the IFD approach. The second class of schemes, called the SPH-like schemes are similar to existing Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics codes, in which the simulation grid moves with the flow of the field being modelled.",0

35396,1,"Quantum chemical calculations and spectroscopic measurements of spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of given uranyl complexes in aqueous solutions with possible environmental and industrial applications A brief introduction into computational methodology and preliminary results for spectroscopic (excitation energies, vibrational frequencies in ground and excited electronic states) and thermodynamic (stability constants, standard enthalpies and entropies of complexation reactions) properties of some 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 uranyl sulphato- and selenato- complexes in aqueos solutions will be given. The relativistic effects are included via Effective Core Potential (ECP), electron correlation via (TD)DFT/B3LYP (dispersion interaction corrected) and solvation is described via explicit inclusion of one hydration sphere beyond the coordinated water molecules. We acknowledge limits of this approximate description - more accurate calculations (ranging from semi-phenomenological two-component spin-orbit coupling up to four-component Dirac-Coulomb-Breit hamiltonian) and Molecular Dynamics simulations are in preparation. The computational results are compared with the experimental results from Time-resolved Laser-induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (TRLFS) and UV-VIS spectroscopic studies (including our original experimental research on this topic). In case of the TRLFS and UV-VIS speciation studies, the problem of complex solution spectra decomposition into individual components is ill-conditioned and hints from theoretical chemistry could be very important. Qualitative agreement between our quantum chemical calculations of the spectroscopic properties and experimental data was achieved. Possible applications for geochemical modelling (e.g. safety studies of nuclear waste repositories, modelling of a future mining site) and analytical chemical studies (including natural samples) are discussed.",0
35422,1,"Causality inference in stochastic systems from neurons to currencies: Profiting from small sample size Success in modeling complex phenomena such as human perception hinges critically on the availability of data and computational power. Significant progress has been made in modeling such phenomena using probabilistic methods, particularly in image analysis and speech recognition. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) combined with Bayesian model selection is the basis of much of this progress, as MLE converges to the true model with copious data. In the sciences, large enough datasets are rarae aves, so alternatives to MLE must be developed for small sample size. We introduce a data-driven statistical physics approach to model inference based on minimizing a free energy of data and show superior model recovery for small sample sizes. We demonstrate coupling strength inference in non-equilibrium kinetic Ising models, including in the difficult large coupling variability regime, and show scaling to systems of arbitrary size. As applications, we infer a functional connectivity network in the salamander retina and a currency exchange rate network from time-series data of neuronal spiking and currency exchange rates, respectively. Accurate small sample size inference is critical for devising a profitable currency hedging strategy.",0
35425,1,"On the inherent competition between valid and spurious inductive inferences in Boolean data Inductive inference is the process of extracting general rules from specific observations. This problem also arises in the analysis of biological networks, such as genetic regulatory networks, where the interactions are complex and the observations are incomplete. A typical task in these problems is to extract general interaction rules as combinations of Boolean covariates, that explain a measured response variable. The inductive inference process can be considered as an incompletely specified Boolean function synthesis problem. This incompleteness of the problem will also generate spurious inferences, which are a serious threat to valid inductive inference rules. Using random Boolean data as a null model, here we attempt to measure the competition between valid and spurious inductive inference rules from a given data set. We formulate two greedy search algorithms, which synthesize a given Boolean response variable in a sparse disjunct normal form, and respectively a sparse generalized algebraic normal form of the variables from the observation data, and we evaluate numerically their performance.",0
35517,1,"The hidden null structure of the compressible Euler equations and a prelude to applications We derive a new formulation of the compressible Euler equations exhibiting remarkable structures, including surprisingly good null structures. The new formulation comprises covariant wave equations for the Cartesian components of the velocity and the logarithmic density coupled to a transport equation for the specific vorticity, defined to be vorticity divided by density. The equations allow one to use the full power of the geometric vectorfield method in treating the ""wave part"" of the system. A crucial feature of the new formulation is that all derivative-quadratic inhomogeneous terms verify the strong null condition. The latter is a nonlinear condition signifying the complete absence of nonlinear interactions involving more than one differentiation in a direction transversal to the acoustic characteristics. Moreover, the same good structures are found in the equations verified by the Euclidean divergence and curl of the specific vorticity. This is important because one needs to combine estimates for the divergence and curl with elliptic estimates to obtain sufficient regularity for the specific vorticity, whose derivatives appears as inhomogeneous terms in the wave equations. The above structures collectively open the door for our forthcoming results: exhibiting a stable regime in which initially smooth solutions develop a shock singularity (in particular the first Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives of the velocity and density blow up) while, relative to a system of geometric coordinates adapted to the acoustic characteristics, the solution (including the vorticity) remains many times differentiable, all the way up to the shock. The good null structures, which are often associated with global solutions, are in fact key to proving that the shock singularity forms. Our secondary goal in this article is to overview the central role that the structures play in the proof.",0

35848,1,"Detecting dynamical changes in time series by using the Jensen Shannon Divergence Most of the time series in nature are a mixture of signals with deterministic and random dynamics. Thus the distinction between these two characteristics becomes important. Distinguishing between chaotic and aleatory signals is difficult because they have a common wide-band power spectrum, a delta-like autocorrelation function, and share other features as well. In general signals are presented as continuous records and require to be discretized for being analyzed. In this work we present different schemes for discretizing and for detection of dynamical changes in time series. One of the main motivations is to detect transition from chaotic regime to random regime. The tools used are originated in Information Theory. The schemes proposed are applied to simulated and real life signals, showing in all cases a high proficiency for detecting changes in the dynamics of the associated time series.",0
35971,1,"Microscopy as a statistical, Rényi-Ulam, half-lie game: a new heuristic search strategy to accelerate imaging Finding a fluorescent target in a biological environment is a common and pressing microscopy problem. This task is formally analogous to the canonical search problem. In ideal (noise-free, truthful) search problems, the well-known binary search is optimal. The case of half-lies, where one of two responses to a search query may be deceptive, introduces a richer, Rényi-Ulam problem and is particularly relevant to practical microscopy. We analyse microscopy in the contexts of Rényi-Ulam games and half-lies, developing a new family of heuristics. We show the cost of insisting on verification by positive result in search algorithms, for the zero-half-lie case bisectioning with verification incurs a 50% penalty in the average number of queries required. The optimal partitioning of search spaces directly following verification in the presence of random half-lies is determined. Trisectioning with verification is shown to be the most efficient heuristic of the family in a majority of cases.",0

36264,1,"High Resolution Study of Presupernova Compactness The density structure surrounding the iron core of a massive star when it dies is known to have a major effect on whether or not the star explodes. Here we repeat previous surveys of presupernova evolution with some important corrections to code physics and four to ten times better mass resolution in each star. The number of presupernova masses considered is also much larger. Over 4,000 models are calculated in the range from 12 to 60 Msun with varying mass loss rates. The core structure is not greatly affected by the increased spatial resolution. The qualitative patterns of compactness measures and their extrema are the same, but with the increased number of models, the scatter seen in previous studies is replaced by several localized branches. More physics-based analyses by Ertl et al. (2016) and M$\""u$eller et al. (2016) show these branches with less scatter than the single parameter characterization of O'Connor & Ott (2011). These branches are particularly apparent for stars in the mass ranges 14 - 19 Msun and 22 - 24 Msun. The multi-valued solutions are a consequence of interference between several carbon and oxygen burning shells during the late stages of evolution. For a relevant range of masses, whether a star explodes or not may reflect more the small, almost random differences in its late evolution than its initial mass. The large number of models allow statistically meaningful statements about the radius, luminosity, and effective temperatures of presupernova stars, their core structures, and their remnant mass distribution.",0
36311,1,"Abundance analysis of extremely metal-poor stars The outer atmosphere of the first generations of low-mass (M < 0.8 M⊙) stars retain to a great extent the original chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) at the time and place of their birth. The composition of this pristine gas represents the nucleosynthesis of the very first massive stars, that produced and ejected the first heavy elements into the early ISM. Thus a detailed abundance analysis of low-mass, metal-poor stars can help us track these gasses and provide insight into the formation processes that took place in the very early stages of our Galaxy. Preliminary result of a 25-star homogeneously analysed sample of metal- poor candidates from the Hamburg/ESO survey is presented. The main focus is on the most metal-poor stars of the sample; stars with [Fe/H] < −4.

The efficiency of such uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics is illustrated with two examples: superpositions of two squeezed states and the Lévy-type heavy-tailed wave function. Improvement over both the variance-based and Shannon entropy based uncertainty relations is demonstrated in both these cases.",0
36593,1,"On the Effect of Rotation on Populations of Classical Cepheids II. Pulsation Analysis for Metallicities 0.014, 0.006, and 0.002 Classical Cepheid variable stars (from hereon: Cepheids) are high-sensitivity probes of stellar evolution and fundamental tracers of cosmic distances. While rotational mixing significantly affects the evolution of Cepheid progenitors (intermediate-mass stars), the impact of the resulting changes in stellar structure and composition on Cepheids and their pulsational properties is hitherto unknown. Here we present the first detailed pulsational instability analysis of stellar evolution models that include the effects of rotation, for both fundamental mode and first overtone pulsation. We employ Geneva evolution models spanning a three-dimensional grid in mass (1.7-15 M_&#8857;), metallicity (Z = 0.014, 0.006, 0.002), and rotation (non-rotating, average & fast rotation). We determine (1) hot and cool instability strip (IS) boundaries taking into account the coupling between convection and pulsation; (2) pulsation periods; and (3) rates of period change. We investigate relations between period and (a) luminosity; (b) age; (c) radius; (d) temperature; (e) rate of period change; (f) mass; (g) the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relation (FWGLR). We confront all predictions aside from those for age with observations, finding generally excellent agreement. We tabulate period-luminosity relations (PLRs) for several photometric pass-bands and investigate how the finite IS width, different IS crossings, metallicity, and rotation affect PLRs. We show that a Wesenheit index based on H, V, and I photometry is expected to have the smallest intrinsic PLR dispersion. We confirm that rotation resolves the Cepheid mass discrepancy. Period-age relations depend significantly on rotation, with rotation leading to older Cepheids, offering a straightforward explanation for evolved stars in binary systems that cannot be matched by conventional isochrones assuming a single age. We further show that Cepheids obey a tight FWGLR. Rotation is a fundamental property of stars that has important implications for the study of intermediate-mass stars, intermediate-age clusters, and classical Cepheid variable stars.",0
36607,1,"The evolution of grain mantles and silicate dust growth at high redshift In dense molecular clouds, interstellar grains are covered by mantles of iced molecules. The formation of the grain mantles has two important consequences: it removes species from the gas phase and promotes the synthesis of new molecules on the grain surfaces. The composition of the mantle is a strong function of the environment which the cloud belongs to. Therefore, clouds in high-zeta galaxies, where conditions -like temperature, metallicity and cosmic rays flux- are different from those in the Milky Way, will have different grain mantles. In the last years, several authors have suggested that silicate grains might grow by accretion of silicon bearing species on smaller seeds. This would occur simultaneously to the formation of the iced mantles and be greatly affected by its composition as a function of time. In this work, we present a numerical study of the grain mantle formation in high-zeta galaxies and we quantitatively address the possibility of silicate growth. We find that the mantle thickness decreases with increasing redshift, from about 120 to 20 layers for z varying from 0 to 8. Furthermore, the mantle composition is also a strong function of the cloud redshift, with the relative importance of CO, CO2, ammonia, methane and methanol highly varying with z. Finally, being Si-bearing species always a very minor component of the mantle, the formation of silicates in molecular clouds is practically impossible.",0

The measurements reveal that CFs exist close to bilayer quantum Hall states, formed at Landau level filling factors ν=1 and 1/2. Near ν=1, the geometric resonance features are consistent with half the total electron density in the bilayer system, implying that CFs prefer to stay in separate layers and exhibit a two-component behavior. In contrast, close to ν=1/2, CFs appear single-layer-like (single component) as their resonance features correspond to the total density.",0

We describe the dynamic origin of the high efficiency and precise targeting of \textit{Taq} activity in PCR. The spatiotemporal distribution of interaction couplings, frequencies, amplitudes, and phase modulations comprise a pattern of fields which constitutes the electromagnetic image of DNA in the surrounding water, which is what the polymerase enzyme actually recognizes in the DNA water environment.

37516,1,"Dome C ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites: Infrared and Raman fingerprints Context. UltraCarbonaceous Antarctic MicroMeteorites (UCAMMs) represent a small fraction of interplanetary dust particles reaching the Earth’s surface and contain large amounts of an organic component not found elsewhere. They are most probably sampling a contribution from the outer regions of the solar system to the local interplanetary dust particle (IDP) flux. Aims. We characterize UCAMMs composition focusing on the organic matter, and compare the results to the insoluble organic matter (IOM) from primitive meteorites, IDPs, and the Earth. Methods. We acquired synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy (μFTIR) and μRaman spectra of eight UCAMMs from the Concordia/CSNSM collection, as well as N/C atomic ratios determined with an electron microprobe. Results. The spectra are dominated by an organic component with a low aliphatic CH versus aromatic C=C ratio, and a higher nitrogen fraction and lower oxygen fraction compared to carbonaceous chondrites and IDPs. The UCAMMs carbonyl absorption band is in agreement with a ketone or aldehyde functional group. Some of the IR and Raman spectra show a C≡N band corresponding to a nitrile. The absorption band profile from 1400 to 1100 cm-1 is compatible with the presence of C-N bondings in the carbonaceous network, and is spectrally different from that reported in meteorite IOM. We confirm that the silicate-to-carbon content in UCAMMs is well below that reported in IDPs and meteorites. Together with the high nitrogen abundance relative to carbon building the organic matter matrix, the most likely scenario for the formation of UCAMMs occurs via physicochemical mechanisms taking place in a cold nitrogen rich environment, like the surface of icy parent bodies in the outer solar system. The composition of UCAMMs provides an additional hint of the presence of a heliocentric positive gradient in the C/Si and N/C abundance ratios in the solar system protoplanetary disc evolution.",0

37763,1,"Switching Times in Fabry-Perot Measurements We show how to analyze the motion of very low dissipation suspended mirrors in a Fabry-Perot. The very precise measurements of the mirrors motion can be determined, also in the presence of a disturbing noise, by means of the sudden reflectivity changes in special points of the mirrors positions. When the mirrors cross such positions, the effective opto-mechanical potential that arises in the device is (roughly) at a maximum. We show that the motion cross such potential maxima is not only confused by the presence of noise, but also favoured by noise itself that induces hoppings. Thus, the measurements of the times at which the crossings occur can be exploited to identify the properties of the applied signal. We also show how to circumvent the difficulty of the extremely long transient that occur in the system analyzing the escape average time with two different methods: a direct sample average and the indirect estimate from the tail distribution. Numerical simulations and physical insight suggest that the indirect estimate, through the analysis of the distribution tails with an appropriated cut off is robust against the disturbances that arise from the presence of transient dynamics.",0

37963,1,"On the Tracy-Widom$_\beta$ Distribution for $\beta=6$ We study the Tracy-Widom distribution function for Dyson's $\beta$-ensemble with $\beta = 6$. The starting point of our analysis is the recent work of I. Rumanov where he produces a Lax-pair representation for the Bloemendal-Virag equation. The latter is a linear PDE which describes the Tracy-Widom functions corresponding to general values of $\beta$. Using his Lax pair, Rumanov derives an explicit formula for the Tracy-Widom $\beta=6$ function in terms of the second Painleve transcendent and the solution of an auxiliary ODE. Rumanov also shows that this formula allows him to derive formally the asymptotic expansion of the Tracy-Widom function. Our goal is to make Rumanov's approach and hence the asymptotic analysis it provides rigorous. In this paper, the first one in a sequel, we show that Rumanov's Lax-pair can be interpreted as a certain gauge transformation of the standard Lax pair for the second Painleve equation. This gauge transformation though contains functional parameters which are defined via some auxiliary nonlinear ODE which is equivalent to the auxiliary ODE of Rumanov's formula. The gauge-interpretation of Rumanov's Lax-pair allows us to highlight the steps of the original Rumanov's method which needs rigorous justifications in order to make the method complete. We provide a rigorous justification of one of these steps. Namely, we prove that the Painleve function involved in Rumanov's formula is indeed, as it has been suggested by Rumanov, the Hastings-McLeod solution of the second Painleve equation. The key issue which we also discuss and which is still open is the question of integrability of the auxiliary ODE in Rumanov's formula. We note that this question is crucial for the rigorous asymptotic analysis of the Tracy-Widom function. We also notice that our work is a partial answer to one of the problems related to the $\beta$-ensembles formulated by Percy Deift during the June 2015 Montreal Conference on integrable systems.",0
38050,1,"Quantifying multivariate redundancy with maximum entropy decompositions of mutual information Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a nonnegative mutual information decomposition, based on the construction of redundancy lattices, which allows separating the information that a set of variables contains about a target variable into nonnegative components interpretable as the unique information of some variables not provided by others as well as redundant and synergistic components. However, the definition of multivariate measures of redundancy that comply with nonnegativity and conform to certain axioms that capture conceptually desirable properties of redundancy has proven to be elusive. We here present a procedure to determine nonnegative multivariate redundancy measures, within the maximum entropy framework. In particular, we generalize existing bivariate maximum entropy measures of redundancy and unique information, defining measures of the redundant information that a group of variables has about a target, and of the unique redundant information that a group of variables has about a target that is not redundant with information from another group. The two key ingredients for this approach are: First, the identification of a type of constraints on entropy maximization that allows isolating components of redundancy and unique redundancy by mirroring them to synergy components. Second, the construction of rooted tree-based decompositions of the mutual information, which conform to the axioms of the redundancy lattice by the local implementation at each tree node of binary unfoldings of the information using hierarchically related maximum entropy constraints. Altogether, the proposed measures quantify the different multivariate redundancy contributions of a nonnegative mutual information decomposition consistent with the redundancy lattice.",0

Leggett-Garg inequality violations are explored and systematically mapped in squeezing parameter space. Configurations for which LGI violation occurs are found, but it is shown that no violation can be obtained if all squeezing angles vanish, contrary to what happens for the spatial Bell inequalities.

38282,1,"A doubly stochastic enhancement of the Failure Forecast Method using a noisy mean-reverting process We introduce a doubly stochastic method for performing material failure theory based forecasts of volcanic eruptions. The method enhances the well known Failure Forecast Method equation, introducing a new formulation similar to the Hull-White model. In particular, we incorporate a stochastic noise term in the original equation, and systematically characterize the uncertainty. The model is a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a mean reverting solution, which assumes the traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the mean solution. Our implementation allows the model to make excursions from the classical solutions, by including uncertainty in the estimation. The doubly stochastic formulation is particularly powerful, in that it provides a complete posterior probability distribution, allowing civil protection officials to determine a worst case scenario with a specified level of confidence. We validate the new method on historical datasets of precursory signals, across a wide range of possible values of convexity in the solutions and amounts of scattering in the observations. The results show the increased forecasting skill of the doubly stochastic formulation of the SDE.",0
38558,1,"Moduli spaces of (bi)algebra structures in topology and geometry After introducing some motivations for this survey, we describe a formalism to parametrize a wide class of algebraic structures occurring naturally in various problems of topology, geometry and mathematical physics. This allows us to define an ""up to homotopy version"" of algebraic structures which is coherent (in the sense of $\infty$-category theory) at a high level of generality. To understand the classification and deformation theory of these structures on a given object, a relevant idea inspired by geometry is to gather them in a moduli space with nice homotopical and geometric properties. Derived geometry provides the appropriate framework to describe moduli spaces classifying objects up to weak equivalences and encoding in a geometrically meaningful way their deformation and obstruction theory. As an instance of the power of such methods, I will describe several results of a joint work with Gregory Ginot related to longstanding conjectures in deformation theory of bialgebras, $E_n$-algebras and quantum group theory.",0
38571,1,"All-optical control and super-resolution imaging of quantum emitters in layered materials Layered van der Waals materials are emerging as compelling two-dimensional platforms for nanophotonics, polaritonics, valleytronics and spintronics, and have the potential to transform applications in sensing, imaging and quantum information processing. Among these, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is known to host ultra-bright, room-temperature quantum emitters, whose nature is yet to be fully understood. Here we present a set of measurements that give unique insight into the photophysical properties and level structure of hBN quantum emitters. Specifically, we report the existence of a class of hBN quantum emitters with a fast-decaying intermediate and a long-lived metastable state accessible from the first excited electronic state. Furthermore, by means of a two-laser repumping scheme, we show an enhanced photoluminescence and emission intensity, which can be utilized to realize a new modality of far-field super-resolution imaging. Our findings expand current understanding of quantum emitters in hBN and show new potential ways of harnessing their nonlinear optical properties in sub-diffraction nanoscopy.",0
38591,1,"Topology and the optical Dirac equation Through understanding Maxwell's equations as an effective Dirac equation (the `optical Dirac equation'), we re--examine the relationship between electromagnetic interface states and topology. We illustrate a simple case where electromagnetic material parameters play the roles of `mass' and `energy' in an equivalent Dirac equation. The modes trapped between a gyrotropic medium and a mirror are then the counterpart of those at a `domain wall', where the mass of the Dirac particle changes sign. Extending this analogy, we relate the integral of the Berry curvature (the Chern number) to the number of interface states. In contrast to the common approach we show that the Chern number can be computed without knowledge of how the material parameters depend on frequency.",0
38735,1,"Monte-Carlo study of drift mobility in ultrathin organic layers: Miller-Abrahams and Marcus models It is shown by the means of Monte-Carlo modeling that the drift mobility decreases considerably along with the increasing of the layer thickness from 10 to 100 nm, if the hopping rates are calculated in the framework of the Marcus model, according to approximately the same low, as in the case of the Miller-Abrahams model. The diffusion current can contribute approximately the same contribution, as an energetic relaxation of the generated non-equilibrium charge carriers, for the case of moderate disorder.",0
38800,1,"Hyperspectral unmixing with spectral variability using adaptive bundles and double sparsity Spectral variability is one of the major issue when conducting hyperspectral unmixing. Within a given image composed of some elementary materials (herein referred to as endmember classes), the spectral signature characterizing these classes may spatially vary due to intrinsic component fluctuations or external factors (illumination). These redundant multiple endmember spectra within each class adversely affect the performance of unmixing methods. This paper proposes a mixing model that explicitly incorporates a hierarchical structure of redundant multiple spectra representing each class. The proposed method is designed to promote sparsity on the selection of both spectra and classes within each pixel. The resulting unmixing algorithm is able to adaptively recover several bundles of endmember spectra associated with each class and robustly estimate abundances. In addition, its flexibility allows a variable number of classes to be present within each pixel of the hyperspectral image to be unmixed. The proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art unmixing methods that incorporate sparsity using both simulated and real hyperspectral data. The results show that the proposed method can successfully determine the variable number of classes present within each class and estimate the corresponding class abundances.",0

While such spectra are forbidden by fermion doubling in static 1D systems, here we demonstrate their appearance in the stroboscopic dynamics of a periodically driven system. Remarkably, this phenomenon does not rely on any adiabatic assumptions, in contrast to the well known Thouless pump and related models of adiabatic spin pumps. The proposed setup is shown to be experimentally feasible with state-of-the-art techniques used to control ultracold alkaline earth atoms in optical lattices.",0
39036,1,"Prediction of Dynamical Systems by Symbolic Regression We study the modeling and prediction of dynamical systems based on conventional models derived from measurements. Such algorithms are highly desirable in situations where the underlying dynamics are hard to model from physical principles or simplified models need to be found. We focus on symbolic regression methods as a part of machine learning. These algorithms are capable of learning an analytically tractable model from data, a highly valuable property. Symbolic regression methods can be considered as generalized regression methods. We investigate two particular algorithms, the so-called fast function extraction which is a generalized linear regression algorithm, and genetic programming which is a very general method. Both are able to combine functions in a certain way such that a good model for the prediction of the temporal evolution of a dynamical system can be identified. We illustrate the algorithms by finding a prediction for the evolution of a harmonic oscillator based on measurements, by detecting an arriving front in an excitable system, and as a real-world application, the prediction of solar power production based on energy production observations at a given site together with the weather forecast.",0
39095,1,"Equilibration in one-dimensional quantum hydrodynamic systems We study quench dynamics and equilibration in one-dimensional quantum hydrodynamics, which provides effective descriptions of the density and velocity fields in gapless quantum gases. We show that the information content of the large time steady state is inherently connected to the presence of ballistically moving localised excitations. When such excitations are present, the system retains memory of initial correlations up to infinite times, thus evading decoherence. We demonstrate this connection in the context of the Luttinger model, the simplest quantum hydrodynamic model, and in the quantum KdV equation. In the standard Luttinger model, memory of all initial correlations is preserved throughout the time evolution up to infinitely large times, as a result of the purely ballistic dynamics. However nonlinear dispersion or interactions, when separately present, lead to spreading and delocalisation that suppress the above effect by eliminating the memory of non-Gaussian correlations. We show that, for any initial state that satisfies sufficient clustering of correlations, the steady state is Gaussian in terms of the bosonised or fermionised fields in the dispersive or interacting case respectively. On the other hand, when dispersion and interaction are simultaneously present, a semiclassical approximation suggests that localisation is restored as the two effects compensate each other and solitary waves are formed. Solitary waves, or simply solitons, are experimentally observed in quantum gases and theoretically predicted based on semiclassical approaches, but the question of their stability at the quantum level remains to a large extent an open problem. We give a general overview on the subject and discuss the relevance of our findings to general out of equilibrium problems.",0
39160,1,"A fast algorithm for radiative transport in isotropic media We propose in this work a fast numerical algorithm for solving the equation of radiative transfer (ERT) in isotropic media. The algorithm has two steps. In the first step, we derive an integral equation for the angularly averaged ERT solution by taking advantage of the isotropy of the scattering kernel, and solve the integral equation with a fast multipole method (FMM). In the second step, we solve a scattering-free transport equation to recover the original ERT solution. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media.",0

Basic properties of balance are derived, and the connection to correspondences in the sense of Connes is discussed.

39402,1,"Prediction of new ground-state crystal structure of Ta2O5 Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) is a wide-gap semiconductor which has important technological applications. Despite the enormous efforts from both experimental and theoretical studies, the ground-state crystal structure of Ta2O5 is not yet uniquely determined. Based on first-principles calculations in combination with evolutionary algorithm, we identify a triclinic phase of Ta2O5, which is energetically much more stable than any phases or structural models reported previously. Characterization of the static and dynamical properties of the phase reveals the common features shared with previous metastable phases of Ta2O5. In particular, we show that the d spacing of ∼3.8Å found in the x-ray diffraction patterns of many previous experimental works is actually the radius of the second Ta-Ta coordination shell as defined by radial distribution functions.",0
39434,1,"Coronal activity cycles in action - X-rays from alpha Centauri A/B We report on the coronal activity cycles of our stellar neighbors alpha Centauri A/B. The binary has been monitored with XMM-Newton since 2002 to study the long-term evolution of coronal activity evolution in X-rays. The solar analog alpha Cen A was clearly detected early in the program, but virtually faded away from XMM's detectors view around 2005. After remaining nearly a decade in a state of coronal weakness, we now detect a clear re-brightening of its corona. The secondary alpha Cen B dominates the X-ray emission at most times and more than a full cycle is covered for this star. A new X-ray maximum was observed around 2012 that is again followed by gentle dimming over the recent years. The temporal evolution of the X-ray emission can be well understood, in analogy to the 11 year solar-cycle, by coronal activity cycles with different amplitudes and periods operating in both stars.",0
39464,1,"Entanglement dynamics in random media We study how the entanglement dynamics between two-level atoms is impacted by random fluctuations of the light cone. In our model the two-atom system is envisaged as an open system coupled with an electromagnetic field in the vacuum state. We employ the quantum master equation in the Born-Markov approximation in order to describe the completely positive time evolution of the atomic system. We restrict our investigations to the situation in which the atoms are coupled individually to two spatially separated cavities, one of which displays the emergence of light-cone fluctuations. In such a disordered cavity, we assume that the coefficients of the Klein-Gordon equation are random functions of the spatial coordinates. The disordered medium is modeled by a centered, stationary, and Gaussian process. We demonstrate that disorder has the effect of slowing down the entanglement decay. We conjecture that in a strong-disorder environment the mean life of entangled states can be enhanced in such a way as to almost completely suppress quantum nonlocal decoherence.",0

39621,1,"Analytic solution of the domain-wall nonequilibrium stationary state We consider the out-of-equilibrium dynamics generated by joining two domains with arbitrary opposite magnetizations. We study the stationary state which emerges by the unitary evolution via the spin-1/2 XXZ Hamiltonian, in the gapless regime, where the system develops a stationary spin current. Using the generalized hydrodynamic approach, we present a simple formula for the space-time profile of the spin current and the magnetization exact in the limit of long times. As a remarkable effect, we show that the stationary state has a strongly discontinuous dependence on the strength of interaction as confirmed by the exact analytic expression of the Drude weight that we compute. These features allow us to give a qualitative estimation for the transient behavior of the current which is in good agreement with numerical simulations. Moreover, we analyze the behavior around the edge of the magnetization profile, and we argue that, unlike the XX free-fermionic point, interactions always prevent the emergence of a Tracy-Widom scaling.",0
39626,1,"The Parkes HI Zone of Avoidance Survey A blind HI survey of the extragalactic sky behind the southern Milky Way has been conducted with the multibeam receiver on the 64-m Parkes radio telescope. The survey covers the Galactic longitude range 212 < l < 36 and Galactic latitudes |b| < 5, and yields 883 galaxies to a recessional velocity of 12,000 km/s. The survey covers the sky within the HIPASS area to greater sensitivity, finding lower HI-mass galaxies at all distances, and probing more completely the large-scale structures at and beyond the distance of the Great Attractor. Fifty-one percent of the HI detections have an optical/NIR counterpart in the literature. A further 27% have new counterparts found in existing, or newly obtained, optical/NIR images. The counterpart rate drops in regions of high foreground stellar crowding and extinction, and for low-HI mass objects. Only 8% of all counterparts have a previous optical redshift measurement. A notable new galaxy is HIZOA J1353-58, a possible companion to the Circinus galaxy. Merging this catalog with the similarly-conducted northern extension (Donley et al. 2005), large-scale structures are delineated, including those within the Puppis and Great Attractor regions, and the Local Void. Several newly-identified structures are revealed here for the first time. Three new galaxy concentrations (NW1, NW2 and NW3) are key in confirming the diagonal crossing of the Great Attractor Wall between the Norma cluster and the CIZA J1324.7-5736 cluster. Further contributors to the general mass overdensity in that area are two new clusters (CW1 and CW2) in the nearer Centaurus Wall, one of which forms part of the striking 180 deg (100/h Mpc) long filament that dominates the southern sky at velocities of ~3000 km/s, and the suggestion of a further Wall at the Great Attractor distance at slightly higher longitudes.",0
39685,1,"Constraining the PopIII IMF with high-z GRBs We study the signatures of enrichment from PopIII stars in observations of PopII GRBs (GRBIIs) at high redshift by using numerical N-body/hydrodynamical simulations including atomic and molecular cooling, star formation and metal spreading from stellar populations with different initial mass functions (IMFs), yields and lifetimes. PopIII and PopII star formation regimes are followed simultaneously and both a top-heavy and a Salpeter-like IMF for pristine PopIII star formation are adopted. We find that the fraction of GRBIIs hosted in a medium previously enriched by PopIII stars (PopIII-dominated) is model-independent. Typical abundance ratios, such as [Si/O] versus[C/O] and [Fe/C] versus[Si/C], can help to disentangle enrichment from massive and intermediate PopIII stars, while low-mass first stars are degenerate with regular PopII generations. The properties of galaxies hosting PopIII-dominated GRBIIs are not very sensitive to the particular assumption on the mass of the first stars.",0
39953,1,"Multiparametric study of thorium oxide dissolution in aqueous media Thorium oxide is poorly soluble: unlike uranium oxide, concentrated nitric acid medium is not sufficient to get quantitative dissolution. Addition of small amounts of fluoride is required to achieve thorium oxide total dissolution. The effect of several parameters on thorium oxide dissolution in order to optimize the dissolution conditions is reported in this paper. Thus the influence of solid characteristics, dissolution method, temperature and composition of dissolution medium on ThO2 dissolution rate has been studied. No complexing agents tested other than fluoride allows total dissolution. Beyond a given HF concentration a decrease of the dissolution rate is observed due to the formation of a precipitate at the solid/solution interface. It was demonstrated by XPS measurements that this precipitate is constituted of thorium fluoride (ThF4) formed during the ThO2 dissolution. The low concentration of HF required to achieve a total dissolution and the activation energy value measured tends to show a catalytic effect of HF on the dissolution process.",0
39956,1,"Thermal annealing behavior of nano-size metal-oxide particles synthesized by ion implantation in Fe-Cr alloy Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels are promising structural materials for the next generation nuclear reactors, as well as fusion facilities. The detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in the precipitation of nano-oxides during ODS steel production would strongly contribute to the improvement of the mechanical properties and the optimization of manufacturing of ODS steels, with a potentially strong economic impact for their industrialization. A useful tool for the experimental study of nano-oxide precipitation is ion implantation, a technique that is widely used to synthesize precipitate nanostructures in well-controlled conditions. Earlier, we have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing aluminum-oxide particles in the high purity Fe-10Cr alloy by consecutive implantation with Al and O ions at room temperature. This paper describes the effects of high-temperature annealing after the ion implantation stage on the development of the aluminum based oxide nanoparticle system. Using transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography experiments, we demonstrate that post-implantation heat treatment induces the growth of the nano-sized oxides in the implanted region and nucleation of new oxide precipitates behind the implantation zone as a result of the diffusion driven broadening of implant profiles. A tentative scenario for the development of metal-oxide nano-particles at both ion implantation and heat treatment stages is suggested based on the experimental observations.",0

A multiscale generalization is introduced in order to distinguish between different roughness features of images at small and large spatial scales. Numerically generated two-dimensional structures are initially considered for illustrating basic concepts in a controlled framework. Then, more realistic situations are studied. Obtained results allow us to confirm that intrinsic spatial correlations of images are successfully unveiled by implementing this multiscale symbolic information-theory approach. Consequently, we conclude that the proposed representation space is a versatile and practical tool for identifying, characterizing and discriminating image textures.",0

40330,1,"Fractional Brownian motion time-changed by gamma and inverse gamma process Many real time-series exhibit behavior adequate to long range dependent data. Additionally very often these time-series have constant time periods and also have characteristics similar to Gaussian processes although they are not Gaussian. Therefore there is need to consider new classes of systems to model these kinds of empirical behavior. Motivated by this fact in this paper we analyze two processes which exhibit long range dependence property and have additional interesting characteristics which may be observed in real phenomena. Both of them are constructed as the superposition of fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and other process. In the first case the internal process, which plays role of the time, is the gamma process while in the second case the internal process is its inverse. We present in detail their main properties paying main attention to the long range dependence property. Moreover, we show how to simulate these processes and estimate their parameters. We propose to use a novel method based on rescaled modified cumulative distribution function for estimation of parameters of the second considered process. This method is very useful in description of rounded data, like waiting times of subordinated processes delayed by inverse subordinators. By using the Monte Carlo method we show the effectiveness of proposed estimation procedures. Finally, we present the applications of proposed models to real time series.",0
40410,1,"Generalized Goodness-Of-Fit Tests for Correlated Data This paper concerns the problem of applying the generalized goodness-of-fit (gGOF) type tests for analyzing correlated data. The gGOF family broadly covers the maximum-based testing procedures by ordered input $p$-values, such as the false discovery rate procedure, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov type statistics, the $\phi$-divergence family, etc. Data analysis framework and a novel $p$-value calculation approach is developed under the Gaussian mean model and the generalized linear model (GLM). We reveal the influence of data transformations to the signal-to-noise ratio and the statistical power under both sparse and dense signal patterns and various correlation structures. In particular, the innovated transformation (IT), which is shown equivalent to the marginal model-fitting under the GLM, is often preferred for detecting sparse signals in correlated data. We propose a testing strategy called the digGOF, which combines a double-adaptation procedure (i.e., adapting to both the statistic's formula and the truncation scheme of the input $p$-values) and the IT within the gGOF family. It features efficient computation and robust adaptation to the family-retained advantages for given data. Relevant approaches are assessed by extensive simulations and by genetic studies of Crohn's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

40474,1,"Time-reversal symmetric work distributions for closed quantum dynamics in the histories framework A central topic in the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is the definition of thermodynamic work in the quantum regime. One widely used solution is to define work for a closed system undergoing non-equilibrium dynamics according to the two-point energy measurement scheme. However, due to the invasive nature of measurement the two-point quantum work probability distribution cannot describe the statistics of energy change from the perspective of the system alone. We here introduce the quantum histories framework as a method to characterise the thermodynamic properties of the unmeasured, closed dynamics. Constructing continuous power operator trajectories allows us to derive an alternative quantum work distribution for closed quantum dynamics that fulfils energy conservation and is time-reversal symmetric. This opens the possibility to compare the measured work with the unmeasured work, contrasting with the classical situation where measurement does not affect the work statistics. We find that the work distribution of the unmeasured dynamics leads to deviations from the classical Jarzynski equality and can have negative values highlighting distinctly non-classical features of quantum work.",0

This expansion is based on approximating the Coulomb gas by a quasi-free Yukawa gas. Further, we prove that the fluctuations of the linear statistics are given by a Gaussian free field at any positive temperature. Our proof of this central limit theorem uses a loop equation for the Coulomb gas, the free energy asymptotics, and rigidity bounds on the local density fluctuations of the Coulomb gas, which we obtained in a previous paper.",0

Under a periodic RF drive, the coherent spin precession is stabilized at a frequency smaller than that of the drive, demonstrating spontaneous breaking of discrete time translation symmetry. The induced precession frequency is incommensurate with the drive, and hence the obtained state a time quasicrystal. When the drive is turned off, the self sustained coherent precession lives a macroscopically-long time, now representing a time crystal with broken symmetry with respect to continuous time translations.

On studying the associated envelopes, such a parameter can be eliminated by solving two nonlinear partial differential equations. The classical differential geometry of curves can be therefore exploited to get a novel perspective on the equations describing the global theory of pseudo-holomorphic functions.",0
40664,1,"Right-side-stretched multifractal spectra indicate small-worldness in networks Complex network formalism allows to explain the behavior of systems composed by interacting units. Several prototypical network models have been proposed thus far. The small-world model has been introduced to mimic two important features observed in real-world systems: i) local clustering and ii) the possibility to move across a network by means of long-range links that significantly reduce the characteristic path length. A natural question would be whether there exist several ""types"" of small-world architectures, giving rise to a continuum of models with properties (partially) shared with other models belonging to different network families. Here, we take advantage of the interplay between network theory and time series analysis and propose to investigate small-world signatures in complex networks by analyzing multifractal characteristics of time series generated from such networks. In particular, we suggest that the degree of right-sided asymmetry of multifractal spectra is linked with the degree of small-worldness present in networks. This claim is supported by numerical simulations performed on several parametric models, including prototypical small-world networks, scale-free, fractal and also real-world networks describing protein molecules. Our results also indicate that right-sided asymmetry emerges with the presence of the following topological properties: low edge density, low average shortest path, and high clustering coefficient.",0
40679,1,"A Realization of Thurstons Geometrization: Discrete Ricci Flow with Surgery Hamilton's Ricci flow (RF) equations were recently expressed in terms of a sparsely-coupled system of autonomous first-order nonlinear differential equations for the edge lengths of a d-dimensional piecewise linear (PL) simplicial geometry. More recently, this system of discrete Ricci flow (DRF) equations was further simplified by explicitly constructing the Forman-Ricci tensor associated to each edge, thereby diagonalizing the first-order differential operator and avoiding the need to invert large sparse matrices at each time step. We recently showed analytically and numerically that these equations converge for axisymmetric 3-geometries to the corresponding continuum RF equations. We demonstrate here that these DRF equations yield an explicit numerical realization of Thurston's geometrization procedure for a discrete 3D axially-symmetric neckpinch geometry by using surgery to explicitly integrate through its Type-1 neck pinch singularity. A cubic-spline-based adaptive mesh was required to complete the evolution. Our numerically efficient simulations yield the expected Thurston decomposition of the sufficiently pinched axially symmetric geometry into its unique geometric structure -- a direct product of two lobes, each collapsing toward a 3-sphere geometry. The structure of our curvature may be used to better inform one of the vertex and edge weighting factors that appear in the Forman's expression of Ricci curvature on graphs.",0

At the level of regularity assumed here, Einstein's formulation of the pseudohermitian condition is not tensorial and so a reformulation of this condition is given here.

41034,1,"Sonic Landau Levels and Synthetic Gauge Fields in Mechanical Metamaterials Mechanical strain can lead to a synthetic gauge field that controls the dynamics of electrons in graphene sheets as well as light in photonic crystals. Here, we show how to engineer an analogous synthetic gauge field for lattice vibrations. Our approach relies on one of two strategies: shearing a honeycomb lattice of masses and springs or patterning its local material stiffness. As a result, vibrational spectra with discrete Landau levels are generated. Upon tuning the strength of the gauge field, we can control the density of states and transverse spatial confinement of sound in the metamaterial. We also show how this gauge field can be used to design waveguides in which sound propagates with robustness against disorder as a consequence of the change in topological polarization that occurs along a domain wall. By introducing dissipation, we can selectively enhance the domain-wall-bound topological sound mode, a feature that may potentially be exploited for the design of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (SASER, the mechanical analogs of lasers).",0

The trembling motion of an electron results from the interference between the positive and the negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation, separated by one MeV, leading to oscillations at extremely high frequencies which are out of reach experimentally. Recently, it was shown theoretically that electrons in III-V semiconductors are governed by similar equations in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The small energy splittings up to meV result in Zitterbewegung at much smaller frequencies which should be experimentally accessible as an AC current. Here, we demonstrate the Zitterbewegung of electrons in a solid. We show that coherent electron Zitterbewegung can be triggered by initializing an ensemble of electrons in the same spin states in strained n-InGaAs and is probed as an AC current at GHz frequencies. Its amplitude is shown to increase linearly with both the spin-orbit coupling strength and the Larmor frequency of the external magnetic field. The latter dependence is the hallmark of the dynamical generation mechanism of the oscillatory motion of the Zitterbewegung. Our results demonstrate that relativistic quantum mechanics can be studied in a rather simple solid state system at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, the large amplitude of the AC current at high precession frequencies enables ultra-fast spin sensitive electric read-out in solids.",0
41296,1,"Local density of states and its mesoscopic fluctuations near the transition to a superconducting state in disordered systems We develop a theory of the local density of states (LDOS) of disordered superconductors, employing the nonlinear sigma-model formalism and the renormalization-group framework. The theory takes into account the interplay of disorder and interaction couplings in all channels, treating the systems with short-range and Coulomb interactions on equal footing. We explore two-dimensional systems that would be Anderson insulators in the absence of interaction and two- or three-dimensional systems that undergo an Anderson transition in the absence of interaction. We evaluate both the average tunneling density of states and its mesoscopic fluctuations which are related to the LDOS multifractality in normal disordered systems. The obtained average LDOS shows a pronounced depletion around the Fermi energy, both in the metallic phase (i.e., above the superconducting critical temperature Tc) and in the insulating phase near the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT). The fluctuations of the LDOS are found to be particularly strong for the case of short-range interactions, especially, in the regime when Tc is enhanced by Anderson localization. On the other hand, the long-range Coulomb repulsion reduces the mesoscopic LDOS fluctuations. However, also in a model with Coulomb interaction, the fluctuations become strong when the systems approach the SIT.",0
41377,1,"Dirac bi-spinor entanglement under local noise and its simulation by Jaynes-Cummings interactions A description of the effects of the local noise on the quantum entanglement constraining the internal degrees of freedom of Dirac bi-spinor structures driven by arbitrary Poincaré invariant potentials is proposed. Given that the Dirac equation dynamics including external potentials can be simulated by a suitable four level trapped ion setup, quantum entanglement of two-qubit ionic states with quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its projection onto the direction of the external magnetic field (used for lift the ions degeneracy), are recovered by means of a suitable ansatz. This formalism allows the inclusion of noise effects, which leads to disentanglement in the four level trapped ion quantum system. Our results indicate the role of interactions in bi-spinor entanglement, as well as the description of disentanglement in ionic states under local noises. For a state prepared initially in one of the ionic levels, local noise induces entanglement sudden death followed by sudden revivals driven by the noiseless dynamics of the state. Residual quantum correlations are observed in the intervals where such state is separable. Schrödinger cat and Werner states partially loose their initial entanglement content due to the interaction with the noisy environment but presenting entanglement oscillations without sudden death. Because Dirac equation describes low energy excitations of mono layer and bi-layer graphene, the formalism can also be applied to compute, for instance, electron-hole or electron/electron entanglement in various circumstances.",0

We start with the celebrated Lindstr\""om-Gessel-Viennot formula, which we derive in the general case of a graph with cycles.

In this work, we show the uniqueness of a harmonic field in knotted tubes, and reduce the construction of a harmonic field to a Neumann boundary value problem. By analyzing the harmonic field in typical knotted tubes, we identify the torsion driven transition from bipolar to vortex patterns.

This hypothesis is confirmed by detailed numerical simulations as well as an analytical approach based on stochastic density functional theory.",0
42209,1,"Assessing plant community composition fails to capture impacts of white-tailed deer on native and invasive plant species Excessive herbivory can have transformative effects on forest understory vegetation, converting diverse communities into depauperate ones, often with increased abundance of non-native plants. White-tailed deer are a problematic herbivore throughout much of eastern North America and alter forest understory community structure. Reducing (by culling) or eliminating (by fencing) deer herbivory is expected to return understory vegetation to a previously diverse condition. We examined this assumption from 1992 to 2006 at Fermilab (Batavia, IL) where a cull reduced white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance in 1998/1999 by 90 % from 24.6 to 2.5/km2, and at West Point, NY, where we assessed interactive effects of deer, earthworms, and invasive plants using 30 × 30 m paired fenced and open plots in 12 different forests from 2009 to 2012. We recorded not only plant community responses (species presence and cover) within 1 m2 quadrats, but also responses of select individual species (growth, reproduction). At Fermilab, introduced Alliaria petiolata abundance initially increased as deer density increased, but then declined after deer reduction. The understory community responded to the deer cull by increased cover, species richness and height, and community composition changed but was dominated by early successional native forbs. At West Point plant community composition was affected by introduced earthworm density but not deer exclusion. Native plant cover increased and non-native plant cover decreased in fenced plots, thus keeping overall plant cover similar. At both sites native forb cover increased in response to deer reduction, but the anticipated response of understory vegetation failed to materialize at the community level. Deer-favoured forbs (Eurybia divaricata, Maianthemum racemosum, Polygonatum pubescens and Trillium recurvatum) grew taller and flowering probability increased in the absence of deer. Plant community monitoring fails to capture initial and subtle effects of reduced or even cessation of deer browse on browse sensitive species. Measuring responses of individual plants (growth, flowering and reproductive success) provides a more sensitive and powerful assessment of forest understory responses to deer management.",0

42277,1,"A Hierarchical Bayesian Model Accounting for Endmember Variability and Abrupt Spectral Changes to Unmix Multitemporal Hyperspectral Images Hyperspectral unmixing is a blind source separation problem which consists in estimating the reference spectral signatures contained in a hyperspectral image, as well as their relative contribution to each pixel according to a given mixture model. In practice, the process is further complexified by the inherent spectral variability of the observed scene and the possible presence of outliers. More specifically, multi-temporal hyperspectral images, i.e., sequences of hyperspectral images acquired over the same area at different time instants, are likely to simultaneously exhibit moderate endmember variability and abrupt spectral changes either due to outliers or to significant time intervals between consecutive acquisitions. Unless properly accounted for, these two perturbations can significantly affect the unmixing process. In this context, we propose a new unmixing model for multitemporal hyperspectral images accounting for smooth temporal variations, construed as spectral variability, and abrupt spectral changes interpreted as outliers. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian model is inferred using a Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method allowing the posterior of interest to be sampled and Bayesian estimators to be approximated. A comparison with unmixing techniques from the literature on synthetic and real data allows the interest of the proposed approach to be appreciated.",0

42422,1,"Tidal origin of spiral arms in galaxies orbiting a cluster One of the scenarios for the formation of grand-design spiral arms in disky galaxies involves their interactions with a satellite or another galaxy. Here we consider another possibility, where the perturbation is instead due to the potential of a galaxy cluster. Using N-body simulations we investigate the formation and evolution of spiral arms in a Milky-Way-like galaxy orbiting a Virgo-like cluster. The galaxy is placed on a few orbits of different size but similar eccentricity and its evolution are followed for 10 Gyr. The tidally induced, two-armed, approximately logarithmic spiral structure forms on each of them during the pericenter passages. The spiral arms dissipate and wind up with time, to be triggered again at the next pericenter passage. We confirm this transient and recurrent nature of the arms by analyzing the time evolution of the pitch angle and the arm strength. We find that the strongest arms are formed on the tightest orbit, however, they wind up rather quickly and are disturbed by another pericenter passage. The arms on the most extended orbit, which we analyze in more detail, wind up slowly and survive for the longest time. Measurements of the pattern speed of the arms indicate that they are kinematic density waves. We attempt a comparison with observations by selecting grand-design spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Among those, we find nine examples bearing no sign of recent interactions or the presence of companions. For three of them we present close structural analogues among our simulated spiral galaxies.",0

42731,1,"Analysis of the non-stationary model of coupled oscillators with inductive coupling The model of coupled oscillators plays an important role in modern physics. It is used for description of various processes: from vibrations atoms in solid states to electromagnetic oscillations in slow-wave structures. The model with short-range coupling is the most widely used, for which a separate oscillator is coupled with two adjacent ones only. There are two main types of oscillators coupling: capacitive (electric, power) and inductive (magnetic, inertial). In the first case, the coupling is proportional to the amplitudes of oscillations in the adjacent cells, in the second one - to the second derivative of these amplitudes. For numerical study of dynamics of a system that can be described by a model of coupled oscillators with an inductive coupling, it is necessary to find explicit expressions for the second derivatives of the amplitudes. To find these expressions, we propose to use the method that is based on the solution of difference equations. The results of the analysis of this method are given in the paper.",0

We use A and F-stars from the extended Hipparocos catalogue to show that a spiral arm passage (or passages), with an amplitude (or randomly combined amplitudes) of at least {\delta}{\rho} / {\rho} > ~0.15 must have taken place in the past (with {\rho} being the total background density).

We use a class of seven-qubit quantum states to demonstrate the method, where we express all coefficients of the quantum states in terms of concurrences of pure states of a region. When a critical point of an upper bound of Bell's inequality occurs in our quantum states, one of the quantum state is a ground state of the toric code model on a disk manifold. Our result also implies that the maximally entangled states does not suggest local maximum quantum entanglement in our quantum states.",0

43073,1,"Unified non-Fermi liquid and superconductivity in a model of strongly-correlated systems We study a model of strongly-correlated systems that incorporates phases such as Fermi liquids, non-Fermi liquids, and superconductivity, in addition to potential intertwined orders. The model describes Fermi surfaces of spinful electron gas or electron liquid coupled to bosons via an intermediate gauge field. Effectively, the coupling imposes constraints and interactions between the fermion spin and the local boson density. This grants the bosons the meaning as the Schwinger boson of the magnetic order and allows us to probe a larger phase space, rather than around the quantum critical point. We design the initial model so that after the boson and gauge fields are integrated out exactly, the resulting fermion-only effective theory only consists of several local interactions, allowing controlled weak-coupling interpretation for certain parameter regions. Consequently, we find a non-Fermi liquid whose degrees of freedom in the effective theory take the form of an \emph{emergent} Fermi surface that has a different Luttinger volume from the original fermions, therefore explicitly violates the Luttinger theorem. Further, this allows a $d$-wave superconducting instability if the effective interacting induced by boson coupling is in the relevant pairing channel. When the emergent Fermi surface undergoes a Lifshitz transition, the carrier type changes. In addition, we attribute the Mott insulating behavior in the strong coupling limit to the loss of emergent Fermi surface and argue the possibility of coexisting magnetic order. Our effective theory also suggests the possibility of charge density waves as a consequence of \emph{effective} strong repulsion and is independent of the Fermi-surface-nesting scenario. We discuss the possible optimal conditions for higher superconducting transition temperature and potential relevances and implications for realistic materials.",0

43734,1,"Disk heating and bending instability in galaxies with counterrotation With the help of high-resolution long-slit and integral-field spectroscopy observations, the number of confirmed cases of galaxies with counterrotation is increasing rapidly. The evolution of such counterrotating galaxies remains far from being well understood. In this paper we study the dynamics of counterrotating collisionless stellar disks by means of N-body simulations. We show that, in the presence of counterrotation, an otherwise gravitationally stable disk can naturally generate bending waves accompanied by strong disk heating across the disk plane, that is in the vertical direction. Such a conclusion is found to hold even for dynamically warm systems with typical values of the initial vertical-to-radial velocity dispersion ratio sigma_z/sigma_R sim 0.5, for which the role of pressure anisotropy should be unimportant. We note that, during evolution, the sigma_z/sigma_R ratio tends to rise up to values close to unity in the case of locally Jeans-stable disks, whereas in disks that are initially Jeans-unstable it may reach even higher values, especially in the innermost regions. This unusual behavior of the sigma_z/sigma_R ratio in galaxies with counterrotation appears not to have been noticed earlier. Our investigations of systems made of two counterrotating components with different mass-ratios suggest that even apparently normal disk galaxies (i.e., with a minor counterrotating component so as to escape detection in current observations) might be subject to significant disk heating especially in the vertical direction.",0

43847,1,"Discrete diffusion Lyman-alpha radiative transfer Due to its accuracy and generality, Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) has emerged as the prevalent method for Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in arbitrary geometries. The standard MCRT encounters a significant efficiency barrier in the high optical depth, diffusion regime. Multiple acceleration schemes have been developed to improve the efficiency of MCRT but the noise from photon packet discretization remains a challenge. The discrete diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC) scheme has been successfully applied in state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations. Still, the established framework is not optimal for resonant line transfer. Inspired by the DDMC paradigm, we present a novel extension to resonant DDMC (rDDMC) in which diffusion in space and frequency are treated on equal footing. We explore the robustness of our new method and demonstrate a level of performance that justifies incorporating the method into existing Ly$\alpha$ codes. We present computational speedups of $\sim 10^2$-$10^6$ relative to contemporary MCRT implementations with schemes that skip scattering in the core of the line profile. This is because the rDDMC runtime scales with the spatial and frequency resolution rather than the number of scatterings - the latter is typically $\propto \tau_0$ for static media, or $\propto (a \tau_0)^{2/3}$ with core-skipping. We anticipate new frontiers in which on-the-fly Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer calculations are feasible in 3D RHD. More generally, rDDMC is transferable to any computationally demanding problem amenable to a Fokker-Planck approximation of frequency redistribution.",0

Coherence From Model-Free Video Data without Trajectories Viewing a data set such as the clouds of Jupiter, coherence is readily apparent to human observers, especially the Great Red Spot, but also other great storms and persistent structures.

We describe an image processing perspective inference of coherent sets from a fluidic system directly from image data, without attempting to first model underlying flow fields, related to a concept in image processing called motion tracking. In contrast to standard spectral methods for image processing which are generally related to a symmetric affinity matrix, leading to standard spectral graph theory, we need a not symmetric affinity which arises naturally from the underlying arrow of time. We develop an anisotropic, directed diffusion operator corresponding to flow on a directed graph, from a directed affinity matrix developed with coherence in mind, and corresponding spectral graph theory from the graph Laplacian. Our methodology is not offered as more accurate than other traditional methods of finding coherent sets, but rather our approach works with alternative kinds of data sets, in the absence of vector field. Our examples will include partitioning the weather and cloud structures of Jupiter, and a local to Potsdam, N.Y. lake-effect snow event on Earth, as well as the benchmark test double-gyre system.",0
45140,1,"Quantum force estimation in arbitrary non-Markovian Gaussian baths The force estimation problem in quantum metrology with an arbitrary non-Markovian Gaussian bath is considered. No assumptions are made on the bath spectrum and coupling strength with the probe. Considering the natural global unitary evolution of both bath and probe and assuming initial global Gaussian states, we are able to solve the main issues of any quantum metrological problem: the best achievable precision determined by the quantum Fisher information, the best initial state, and the best measurement. Studying the short-time behavior and comparing with regular Markovian dynamics we observe an increase in quantum Fisher information. We emphasize that this phenomenon is due to the ability to perform measurements below the correlation time of the bath, activating non-Markovian effects. This brings huge consequences for the sequential preparation-and-measurement scenario because the quantum Fisher information becomes unbounded when the initial probe mean energy goes to infinity, whereas its Markovian counterpart remains bounded by a constant. The long-time behavior shows the complexity and potential variety of non-Markovian effects, somewhere between the exponential decay characteristic of Markovian dynamics and the sinusoidal oscillations characteristic of resonant narrow bands.",0

To further document NPs biological effects, we investigated the impact of TiO2 NPs morphology on biological outcomes. To this end, TiO2 NPs were synthesized as nanoneedles (NNs), titanate scrolled nanosheets (TNs), gel-sol-based isotropic nanoparticles (INPs) and tested for perturbation of cellular homeostasis (cellular ion content, cell proliferation, stress pathways) in three cell types and compared to the P25. We showed that TiO2 NPs were internalized at various degrees and their toxicity depended on both titanium content and NPs shape, which impacted on intracellular calcium homeostasis thereby leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Finally, we showed that a minimal intracellular content of TiO2 NPs was mandatory to induce toxicity enlightening once more the crucial notion of internalized dose threshold beside the well-recognized dose of exposure.",0
45237,1,"Electron mean free path dependence of the vortex surface impedance In the present study the radio-frequency complex response of trapped vortices in superconductors is calculated and compared to experimental data previously published. The motion equation for a magnetic flux line is solved assuming a bi-dimensional and mean-free-path-dependent Lorentzian-shaped pinning potential. The resulting surface resistance shows the unprecedented bell-shaped trend as a function of the mean-free-path observed in our previous experimental work. We demonstrate that such bell-shaped trend of the surface resistance as a function of the mean-free-path may be described as the interplay of the two limiting regimes of the surface resistance, for low and large mean-free-path values: pinning and flux-flow regimes respectively. Since the possibility of defining the pinning potential at different locations from the surface and with different strengths, we discuss how the surface resistance is affected by different configurations of pinning sites. By tackling the frequency dependence of the surface resistance, we also demonstrate that the separation between pinning- and flux-flow-dominated regimes cannot be determined only by the depinning frequency. The dissipation regime can be tuned either by acting on the frequency or on the mean-free-path value.",0

45342,1,"Nano-size metallic oxide particle synthesis in Fe-Cr alloys by ion implantation Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) steels reinforced with metal oxide nanoparticles are advanced structural materials for nuclear and thermonuclear reactors. The understanding of the mechanisms involved in the precipitation of nano-oxides can help in improving mechanical properties of ODS steels, with a strong impact for their commercialization. A perfect tool to study these mechanisms is ion implantation, where various precipitate synthesis parameters are under control. In the framework of this approach, high-purity Fe-10Cr alloy samples were consecutively implanted with Al and O ions at room temperature and demonstrated a number of unexpected features. For example, oxide particles of a few nm in diameter could be identified in the samples already after ion implantation at room temperature. This is very unusual for ion beam synthesis, which commonly requires post-implantation high-temperature annealing to launch precipitation. The observed particles were composed of aluminium and oxygen, but additionally contained one of the matrix elements (chromium). The crystal structure of aluminium oxide compound corresponds to non-equilibrium cubic γ-Al2O3 phase rather than to more common corundum. The obtained experimental results together with the existing literature data give insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the precipitation of nano-oxides in ODS alloys.",0
45358,1,"Ubiquitous Instabilities of Dust Moving in Magnetized Gas Squire & Hopkins (2017) showed that coupled dust-gas mixtures are generically subject to 'resonant drag instabilities' (RDIs), which drive violently-growing fluctuations in both. But the role of magnetic fields and charged dust has not yet been studied. We therefore explore the RDI in gas which obeys ideal MHD and is coupled to dust via both Lorentz forces and drag, with an external acceleration (e.g. gravity, radiation) driving dust drift through gas. We show this is always unstable, at all wavelengths and non-zero values of dust-to-gas ratio, drift velocity, dust charge, 'stopping time' or drag coefficient (for any drag law), or field strength; moreover growth rates depend only weakly (sub-linearly) on these parameters. Dust charge and magnetic fields do not suppress instabilities, but give rise to a large number of new instability 'families,' each with distinct behavior. The 'MHD-wave' (magnetosonic or Alfven) RDIs exhibit maximal growth along 'resonant' angles where the modes have a phase velocity matching the corresponding MHD wave, and growth rates increase without limit with wavenumber. The 'gyro' RDIs are driven by resonances between drift and Larmor frequencies, giving growth rates sharply peaked at specific wavelengths. Other instabilities include 'acoustic' and 'pressure-free' modes (previously studied), and a family akin to cosmic ray instabilities which appear when Lorentz forces are strong and dust streams super-Alfvenically along field lines. We discuss astrophysical applications in the warm ISM, CGM/IGM, HII regions, SNe ejecta/remnants, Solar corona, cool-star winds, GMCs, and AGN.",0
45363,1,"Forbidden Backscattering and Resistance Dip in the Quantum Limit as a Signature for Topological Insulators Identifying topological insulators and semimetals often focuses on their surface states, using spectroscopic methods such as the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy or scanning tunneling microscopy. In contrast, studying the topological properties of topological insulators from their bulk-state transport is more accessible in most labs but seldom addressed. We show that, in the quantum limit of a topological insulator, the backscattering between the only two states on the Fermi surface of the lowest Landau band can be forbidden, at a critical magnetic field. The conductivity is determined solely by the backscattering between the two states, leading to a resistance dip that may serve as a signature for topological insulator phases. More importantly, this forbidden backscattering mechanism for the resistance dip is irrelevant to details of disorder scattering. Our theory can be applied to re-visit the experiments on Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se, ZrTe$_5$, Ag$_2$Te families, and will be particularly useful for controversial small-gap materials at the boundary between topological insulator and normal insulator.",0

We investigate numerically centrosymmetric spin lattices in films of finite thickness with ferromagnetic exchange, magnetic anisotropy, and dipole-dipole interaction. Evolution of labyrinth domains into compact topological structures on application of the magnetic field is found to be governed by the configuration of Bloch lines inside domain walls. Depending on the combination of Bloch lines, the magnetic domains evolve into individual skyrmions, biskyrmions, or more complex topological objects. While the geometry of such objects is sensitive to the parameters, their topological charge is uniquely determined by the topological charge of Bloch lines inside the magnetic domain from which the object emerges.",0

Two global static methods, symbolic transformations of Wessel N. symbolic entropy and base-scale entropy, and two local ones, namely symbolizations of permutation and differential entropy, constitute four double symbolic joint entropies that have accurate complexity detections in chaotic models, logistic and Henon map series. In nonlinear dynamical analysis of different kinds of heart rate variability, heartbeats of healthy young have higher complexity than those of the healthy elderly, and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients are lowest in heartbeats' joint entropy values.

45933,1,"Realizing Fulde-Ferrell Superfluids via a Dark-State Control of Feshbach Resonances We propose that the long-sought Fulde-Ferrell superfluidity with nonzero momentum pairing can be realized in ultracold two-component Fermi gases of K40 or Li6 atoms by optically tuning their magnetic Feshbach resonances via the creation of a closed-channel dark state with a Doppler-shifted Stark effect. In this scheme, two counterpropagating optical fields are applied to couple two molecular states in the closed channel to an excited molecular state, leading to a significant violation of Galilean invariance in the dark-state regime and hence to the possibility of Fulde-Ferrell superfluidity. We develop a field theoretical formulation for both two-body and many-body problems and predict that the Fulde-Ferrell state has remarkable properties, such as anisotropic single-particle dispersion relation, suppressed superfluid density at zero temperature, anisotropic sound velocity, and rotonic collective mode. The latter two features can be experimentally probed using Bragg spectroscopy, providing a smoking-gun proof of Fulde-Ferrell superfluidity.",0
46032,1,"Power Flow Tracing in Complex Networks The increasing share of decentralized renewable power generation represents a challenge to the current and future energy system. Providing a geographical smoothing effect, long-range power transmission plays a key role for the system integration of these fluctuating resources. However, the build-up and operation of the necessary network infrastructure incur costs which have to be allocated to the users of the system. Flow tracing techniques, which attribute the power flow on a transmission line to the geographical location of its generation and consumption, represent a valuable tool set to design fair usage and thus cost allocation schemes for transmission investments. In this article, we introduce a general formulation of the flow tracing method and apply it to a simplified model of a highly renewable European electricity system. We review a statistical usage measure which allows to integrate network usage information for longer time series, and illustrate this measure using an analytical test case.",0
46106,1,Asymptotic behavior of the wave function of three particles in a continuum We study the wave function of a system of three particles in a continuum. The Faddeev equations are used to explicitly identify the singularities of the wave function in the momentum space. We obtain the asymptotic behavior of the wave function in the configuration space by calculating the asymptotic behavior of the Fourier transform of the wave function in the momentum space. Our attention is focused on configurations in which two particles are at a relatively small distance from each other while the third particle is significantly remote from the center of mass of the pair. We show that the coordinate asymptotic form of the wave function for such a configuration contains scattered waves of a new type in addition to the standard terms. We use the obtained exact data concerning the coordinate asymptotic form of the wave function to critically analyze the multiplicative ansatz used in several works to describe systems of three particles in a continuum.,0

46243,1,"Spin- 12 kagome XXZ model in a field: Competition between lattice nematic and solid orders We study numerically the spin-1/2 XXZ model in a field on an infinite kagome lattice. We use different algorithms based on infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPSs) for this, namely, (i) an approach with simplex tensors and a 9-site unit cell, and (ii) an approach based on coarse-graining three spins in the kagome lattice and mapping it to a square-lattice model with local and nearest-neighbor interactions, with the usual PEPS tensors, 6- and 12-site unit cells. Similarly to our previous calculation at the SU(2)-symmetric point (Heisenberg Hamiltonian), for any anisotropy from the Ising limit to the XY limit, we also observe the emergence of magnetization plateaus as a function of the magnetic field, at mz=13 using 6-, 9-, and 12-site PEPS unit cells, and at mz=19,59, and 79 using a 9-site PEPS unit cell, the latter setup being able to accommodate 3×3 solid order. We also find that, at mz=13, (lattice) nematic and 3×3 VBC-order states are degenerate within the accuracy of the nine-site simplex method, for all anisotropy. The 6- and 12-site coarse-grained PEPS methods produce almost-degenerate nematic and 1×2 VBC-solid orders. We also find that, within our accuracy, the six-site coarse-grained PEPS method gives slightly lower energies, which can be explained by the larger amount of entanglement this approach can handle, even in cases where the PEPS unit cell is not commensurate with the expected ground-state unit cell. Furthermore, we do not observe chiral spin liquid behaviors at and close to the XY point, as has been recently proposed. Our results are the first tensor network investigations of the XXZ model in a field and reveal the subtle competition between nearby magnetic orders in numerical simulations of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets, as well as the delicate interplay between energy optimization and symmetry in tensor network numerical simulations.",0
46262,1,"Properties of Healthcare Teaming Networks as a Function of Network Construction Algorithms Network models of healthcare systems can be used to examine how providers collaborate, communicate, refer patients to each other. Most healthcare service network models have been constructed from patient claims data, using billing claims to link patients with providers. The data sets can be quite large, making standard methods for network construction computationally challenging and thus requiring the use of alternate construction algorithms. While these alternate methods have seen increasing use in generating healthcare networks, there is little to no literature comparing the differences in the structural properties of the generated networks. To address this issue, we compared the properties of healthcare networks constructed using different algorithms and the 2013 Medicare Part B outpatient claims data. Three different algorithms were compared: binning, sliding frame, and trace-route. Unipartite networks linking either providers or healthcare organizations by shared patients were built using each method. We found that each algorithm produced networks with substantially different topological properties. Provider networks adhered to a power law, and organization networks to a power law with exponential cutoff. Censoring networks to exclude edges with less than 11 shared patients, a common de-identification practice for healthcare network data, markedly reduced edge numbers and greatly altered measures of vertex prominence such as the betweenness centrality. We identified patterns in the distance patients travel between network providers, and most strikingly between providers in the Northeast United States and Florida. We conclude that the choice of network construction algorithm is critical for healthcare network analysis, and discuss the implications for selecting the algorithm best suited to the type of analysis to be performed.",0

A possible realization with a needle-shaped obstacle is proposed to produce and detect this instability by measuring the electric potential difference between contact points located before and after the obstacle. We also show that, for our setup, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability leads to the formation of whirlpools similar to the ones reported in Bandurin et al.

46474,1,"Transducer finite aperture effects in sound transmission near leaky Lamb modes in elastic plates at normal incidence The interaction of ultrasonic waves with fluid-embedded viscoelastic plates, pipes, and shells, have been subject to extensive theoretical and experimental studies over several decades. In normal-incidence through-transmission measurements of a water-embedded solid plate using ultrasonic piezoelectric transducer sound fields, significant deviations from plane wave theory have recently been observed. To quantitatively describe such measured phenomena, finite element modeling (FEM), also combined with an angular spectrum method (ASM), have been used for three-dimensional (3D) simulation of the voltage-to-sound-pressure signal propagation through the electro-acoustic measurement system consisting of the piezoelectric transducer, the water-embedded steel plate, and the fluid regions at both sides of the plate. The observed phenomena of frequency downshift of the plate resonance, increased sound pressure level through the plate, and beam narrowing / widening, are ascribed to the finite angular spectrum of the beam, that excites a region of negative and zero group velocity for the leaky Lamb mode in question.",0

46659,1,"Quantifying Acoustophoretic Separation of Microparticle Populations by Mean-and-Covariance Dynamics for Gaussians in Mixture Models A method for the quantification of acoustophoretic separation and dispersion for microparticle populations featuring continuously distributed physical parameters is presented. The derivation of the method starts by (i)~considering the equation of motion for a particle ensemble in the coordinate+parameter space, (ii)~performing moment analysis on the transport equation for the probability density function (PDF), and (iii)~expanding up to the first-order the drift (and the diffusion coefficient) around the mean of the PDF. Following these steps, a system of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the mean and the covariance in the coordinate+parameter space is derived. These differential equations enable for the approximation of the acoustophoretic separation dynamics of particle ensembles by using a gaussian mixture for which the mean and the covariance of each gaussian evolve according to the mean-and-covariance dynamics. The approximation property of this method is shown by comparison with direct numerical simulations of particle ensembles in the cases of prototypical models of acoustophoretic and free-flow acoustophoretic separations for which the particle populations are distributed according to the radius. Furthermore, the indicators for quantifying free-flow acoustophoretic separation performance are introduced, and a method for the inference of particle-histogram parameters is illustrated.",0

46785,1,"Cosmological evolution of the Nitrogen abundance The abundance of nitrogen in the interstellar medium is a powerful probe of star for- mation processes over cosmological timescales. Since nitrogen can be produced both in massive and intermediate-mass stars with metallicity-dependent yields, its evolution is challenging to model, as evidenced by the differences between theoretical predictions and observations. In this work we attempt to identify the sources of these discrepancies using a cosmic evolution model. To further complicate matters, there is considerable dispersion in the abundances from observations of DLAs at redshift 2 - 3. We study the evolution of nitrogen with a detailed chemical evolution model and find good agreement with observations, including the relative abundances of N/O and N/Si ratios. We find that the principal contribution of nitrogen comes from intermediate mass stars, with the exception of systems with the lowest N/H, where nitrogen production might possibly be dominated by massive stars. This last result could be strengthened if stellar rotation which is important at low metallicity can produce significant amounts of nitrogen. Moreover, these systems likely reside in host galaxies with stellar masses below 10**8.5 solar mass. We also study the origin of the observed dispersion in nitrogen abundances using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations Horizon-AGN. We conclude that this dispersion can originate from two effects: differ- ence in the masses of the DLA host galaxies, and difference in the their position inside the galaxy.",0

In this paper, we determine the relative signs of the automorphisms of these moduli spaces induced by interchanges of boundary components of the domain and by the anti-symplectic involution on the target manifold, without any global assumptions on the latter. As immediate applications, we describe sufficient conditions for the moduli spaces of real genus $1$ maps and for real maps with separating fixed locus to be orientable; we treat the general genus $2+$ case in a separate paper.

46897,1,"Image mosaicing of tunnel wall images using high level features This paper proposes a novel approach for position offset correction of images taken from a moving robotic platform in tunnel environments using image mosaicing. An image mosaic is formed by combining multiple images which capture overlapping components of a scene into a larger image. Unlike current image mosaicing methods, which use low-level features such as corners, our method uses binary edges as high-level features for image registration via template matching. This is necessary since such low-level features are absent or rare in tunnel environments. A shading correction algorithm is applied as a pre-processing step to adjust the uneven illumination present in this environment. This technique is simple and efficient while being robust to small camera rotations and small variations in camera distance from the wall. Experimental results show that our method contributes to good image mosaicing results with a low computational complexity, which is attractive for real-time image-based inspection applications.",0

47008,1,"The technique of probing acceptance as a tool for teachers' professional development: A PCK study This article presents a study that examined an innovative short-term program (two sessions of 3 hr each) for the professional development of teachers. The program design is based on the technique of probing acceptance, which is aimed at investigating student learning processes. It relies on students' evaluation, paraphrasing, and adaptation of information presented during a one-on-one interview with defined student-centered interview phases. During the professional development program, teachers were introduced to a novel learning unit that focuses on the subatomic structure of matter. In addition, the teachers were instructed in how to use the technique of probing acceptance during one-on-one interviews to evaluate the concepts of the unit. The rationale of the professional development program is that the preparation and execution of, and reflection on the one-on-one interviews based on the technique of probing acceptance should have an impact on dimensions of teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Four teachers from one Austrian high school participated in this exploratory study, and each teacher conducted two one-on-one interviews with two different grade-6 students. Postintervention interviews were conducted with all the teachers to document the potential influences on the teachers' PCK. The interviews were transcribed word for word, and a category-based content analysis was applied to the transcripts. Our results indicate that during the professional development program, all the teachers revisited their existing knowledge about the subatomic structure of matter and left with an enhanced PCK, especially regarding their knowledge of learners and of instructional strategies. Overall, we show the technique of probing acceptance to be a promising tool for short-term professional development programs, and we suggest that our findings have implications for both professional development designers and educators.",0

We present a chemical abundance analysis of the brightest star in the newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidate Tucana III. Because it is particularly bright for a star in an ultra-faint Milky Way satellite, we are able to measure the abundance of 28 elements, including 13 neutron-capture species. This star, DES J235532.66$-$593114.9 (DES J235532), shows a mild enhancement in neutron-capture elements associated with the $r$-process and can be classified as an $r$-I star. DES J235532 is the first $r$-I star to be discovered in an ultra-faint satellite, and Tuc III is the second extremely low-luminosity system found to contain $r$-process enriched material, after Reticulum II. Comparison of the abundance pattern of DES J235532 with $r$-I and $r$-II stars found in other dwarf galaxies and in the Milky Way halo suggests a common astrophysical origin for the neutron-capture elements seen in all $r$-process enhanced stars.

The tools developed allow for ultracold chemical reactions to be managed using magnetic fields, light fields and spin-state manipulation of the colliding particles among other methods. The control of chemical reactions in ultracold atom-ion collisions is a young and growing field of research. Recently, the collision energy and the ion electronic state were used to control atom-ion interactions. Here, we demonstrate spin-controlled atom-ion inelastic processes. In our experiment, both spin-exchange and charge-exchange reactions are controlled in an ultracold Rb-Sr$^+$ mixture by the atomic spin state. We prepare a cloud of atoms in a single hyperfine spin-state. Spin-exchange collisions between atoms and ion subsequently polarize the ion spin. Electron transfer is only allowed for (RbSr)$^+$ colliding in the singlet manifold.

This calls for the development of new algorithms that can deal with the size, complexity, and the special structure of such datasets. In this paper, we consider the problem of classifying p>>n data and propose a classification method based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Traditional LDA depends on the covariance estimate of the data, but when p>>n the sample covariance estimate is singular. The proposed method estimates the covariance by using a sparse version of noisy principal component analysis (nPCA). The use of sparsity in this setting aims at automatically selecting variables that are relevant for classification. In experiments, the new method is compared to state-of-the art methods for big data problems using both simulated datasets and imaging genetics datasets.",0
47541,1,"Floer homologies, with applications Floer invented his theory in the mid eighties in order to prove the Arnol'd conjectures on the number of fixed point of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and Lagrangian intersections. Over the last thirty years, many versions of Floer homology have been constructed. In symplectic and contact dynamics and geometry they have become a principal tool, with applications that go far beyond the Arnol'd conjectures: The proof of the Conley conjecture and of many instances of the Weinstein conjecture, rigidity results on Lagrangian submanifolds and on the group of symplectomorphisms, lower bounds for the topological entropy of Reeb flows and obstructions to symplectic embeddings are just some of the applications of Floer's seminal ideas. Other Floer homologies are of topological nature. Among their applications are Property P for knots and the construction of compact topological manifolds of dimension greater than five that are not triangulisable. This is by no means a comprehensive survey on the presently known Floer homologies and their applications. Such a survey would take several hundred pages. We just describe some of the most classical versions and applications, together with the results that we know or like best. The text is written for non-specialists, and the focus is on ideas rather than generality. Two intermediate sections recall basic notions and concepts from symplectic dynamics and geometry.",0
47547,1,"Meson formation in mixed-dimensional t-J models Surprising properties of doped Mott insulators are at the heart of many quantum materials, including transition metal oxides and organic materials. The key to unraveling complex phenomena observed in these systems lies in understanding the interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom. One of the most debated questions concerns the nature of charge carriers in a background of fluctuating spins. To shed new light on this problem, we suggest a simplified model with mixed dimensionality, where holes move through a Mott insulator unidirectionally while spin exchange interactions are two dimensional. By studying individual holes in this system, we find direct evidence for the formation of mesonic bound states of holons and spinons, connected by a string of displaced spins -- a precursor of the spin-charge separation obtained in the 1D limit of the model. Our predictions can be tested using ultracold atoms in a quantum gas microscope, allowing to directly image spinons and holons, and reveal the short-range hidden string order which we predict in this model.",0

Carbon nanotubes are the most typical example of nano-channels that can confine a large amount of channeled particles and confined plasmon in a coupling condition. This paper presents theoretical and numerical study on the concept of the laser-driven surface-plasmon (SP) acceleration in a carbon nanotube (CNT) channel. Analytic description of the SP-assisted laser acceleration is detailed with practical acceleration parameters, in particular with specifications of a typical tabletop femto-second laser system.

47724,1,"On the role of precursor powder composition in controlling microstructure, flux pinning, and the critical current density of Ag/Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_x$ conductors Precursor powder composition is known to strongly affect the critical current density (J c) of Ag/Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (Bi-2212) wires. However, reasons for such J c dependence have not yet been fully understood, compromising our ability to achieve further optimization. We systematically examined superconducting properties, microstructural evolution and phase transformation, and grain boundaries of Bi-2212 conductors fabricated from precursor powders with a range of compositions using a combination of transport-current measurements, a quench technique to freeze microstructures at high temperatures during heat treatment, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Samples include both dip-coated tapes and round wires, among which a commercial round wire carries a high J c of 7600 A mm−2 at 4.2 K, self-field and 2600 A mm−2 at 4.2 K, 20 T, respectively. In the melt, this high-J c conductor, made using a composition of Bi2.17Sr1.94Ca0.89Cu2Ox, contains a uniform dispersion of fine alkaline-earth cuprate (AEC) and copper-free solid phases, whereas several low-J c conductors contain large AEC particles. Such significant differences in the phase morphologies in the melt are accompanied by a drastic difference in the formation kinetics of Bi-2212 during recrystallization cooling. STEM studies show that Bi-2212 grain colonies in the high-J c conductors have a high density of Bi2Sr2CuO y (Bi-2201) intergrowths, whereas a low-J c conductor, made using Bi2.14Sr1.66Ca1.24Cu1.96O x , is nearly free of them. STEM investigation shows grain boundaries in low-J c conductors are often insulated with a Bi-rich amorphous phase. High-J c conductors also show higher flux-pinning strength, which we ascribe to their higher Bi-2201 intergrowth density.",0

Sufficient conditions for the occurrence of a host of possible phase transitions both in and out of equilibrium are derived. These transitions manifest themselves as singularities in the large deviation function, resulting in enhanced current fluctuations. Microscopic models which implement each of the scenarios are presented, with possible experimental realizations. Depending on the model, the singularity is associated either with a particle-hole symmetry breaking, which leads to a continuous transition, or in the absence of the symmetry with a first-order phase transition. An exact Landau theory which captures the different singular behaviors is derived.",0

In this paper, we study a system that has both features, but with weak (repulsive) interactions and a weakly coupled spin. We show that for a strongly anisotropic exchange interaction, at low temperatures the system enters a strong coupling limit in which it hosts two Z4 parafermions, characterizing a fourfold degeneracy of the ground state. We construct the parafermion operators explicitly and show that they facilitate fractional e/2 charge tunneling across the junction. The dependence of the effective low-energy spectrum on the superconducting phase difference reveals an 8π periodicity of the supercurrent.",0

48588,1,"An Analysis of ALMA Deep Fields and the Perceived Dearth of High-z Galaxies Deep, pencil-beam surveys from ALMA at 1.1-1.3mm have uncovered an apparent absence of high-redshift dusty galaxies, with existing redshift distributions peaking around $z\sim1.5-2.5$. This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty systems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early Universe was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward evolution galaxy model described by Casey et al. (2018) to the ALMA regime (in depth and area) and determine that the measured number counts and redshift distributions from ALMA deep field surveys are fully consistent with constraints of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) at $z<2.5$ determined by single-dish submillimeter and millimeter surveys conducted on much larger angular scales ($\sim1-10$deg$^{2}$). We find that measured 1.1-1.3mm number counts are most constraining for the measurement of the faint-end slope of the IRLF at $z<2.5$ instead of the prevalence of dusty galaxies at $z>4$. Recent studies have suggested that UV-selected galaxies at $z>4$ may be particularly dust-poor, but we find their millimeter-wave emission cannot rule out consistency with the Calzetti dust attenuation law even by assuming relatively typical, cold-dust ($T_{\rm dust}\approx30\,$K) SEDs. Our models suggest that the design of ALMA deep fields requires substantial revision to constrain the prevalence of $z>4$ early Universe obscured starbursts. The most promising avenue for detection and characterization of such early dusty galaxies will come from future ALMA 2mm blank field surveys covering a few hundred arcmin$^{2}$ and the combination of existing and future dual-purpose 3mm datasets.",0
48619,1,"Radiative cooling of swept up gas in AGN-driven galactic winds and its implications for molecular outflows We recently used hydro-chemical simulations to demonstrate that molecular outflows observed in luminous quasars can be explained by molecule formation within the AGN wind. However, these simulations cover a limited parameter space, due to their computational cost. We have therefore developed an analytic model to follow cooling in the shocked ISM layer of an AGN wind. We explore different ambient densities ($1-10^{4} \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$), density profile slopes ($0-1.5$), AGN luminosities ($10^{44}-10^{47} \, \rm{erg} \, \rm{s}^{-1}$), and metallicities ($0.1-3 \rm{Z}_{\odot}$). The swept up gas mostly cools within ~1 Myr. Based on our previous simulations, we predict that this gas would produce observable molecular outflows. The instantaneous momentum boost initially increases as the outflow decelerates. However, it reaches a maximum of $\approx$20, due to work done against the gravitational potential. The predicted time-averaged observational estimate of the molecular outflow momentum boost reaches a maximum of $\approx1-2$, partly due to our assumed molecular fraction, 0.2, but also because the instantaneous and observational, time-averaged definitions are not equivalent. Thus recent observational estimates of order unity momentum boosts do not necessarily rule out energy-driven outflows. Finally, we find that dust grains are likely to re-form by accretion of metals after the shocked ISM layer has cooled, assuming that a small fraction of dust grains swept up after this layer has cooled are able to mix into the cool phase, and assuming that grain growth remains efficient in the presence of the strong AGN radiation field. This would enable rapid molecule formation, as assumed in our models.",0
48634,1,"The algebra of entanglement and the geometry of composition String diagrams turn algebraic equations into topological moves that have recurring shapes, involving the sliding of one diagram past another. We individuate, at the root of this fact, the dual nature of polygraphs as presentations of higher algebraic theories, and as combinatorial descriptions of ""directed spaces"". Operations of polygraphs modelled on operations of topological spaces are used as the foundation of a compositional universal algebra, where sliding moves arise from tensor products of polygraphs. We reconstruct several higher algebraic theories in this framework. In this regard, the standard formalism of polygraphs has some technical problems. We propose a notion of regular polygraph, barring cell boundaries that are not homeomorphic to a disk of the appropriate dimension. We define a category of non-degenerate shapes, and show how to calculate their tensor products. Then, we introduce a notion of weak unit to recover weakly degenerate boundaries in low dimensions, and prove that the existence of weak units is equivalent to a representability property. We then turn to applications of diagrammatic algebra to quantum theory. We re-evaluate the category of Hilbert spaces from the perspective of categorical universal algebra, which leads to a bicategorical refinement. Then, we focus on the axiomatics of fragments of quantum theory, and present the ZW calculus, the first complete diagrammatic axiomatisation of the theory of qubits. The ZW calculus has several advantages over ZX calculi, including a computationally meaningful normal form, and a fragment whose diagrams can be read as setups of fermionic oscillators. Moreover, its generators reflect an operational classification of entangled states of 3 qubits. We conclude with generalisations of the ZW calculus to higher-dimensional systems, including the definition of a universal set of generators in each dimension.",0
48645,1,"Classification of Hamiltonians in neighborhoods of band crossings in terms of the theory of singularities We classify two-by-two traceless Hamiltonians depending smoothly on a three-dimensional Bloch wavenumber and having a band crossing at the origin of the wavenumber space. Recently these Hamiltonians attract much interest among researchers in the condensed matter field since they are found to be effective Hamiltonians describing the band structure of the exotic materials such as Weyl semimetals. In this classification, we regard two such Hamiltonians as equivalent if there are appropriate special unitary transformation of degree 2 and diffeomorphism in the wavenumber space fixing the origin such that one of the Hamiltonians transforms to the other. Based on the equivalence relation, we obtain a complete list of classes up to codimension 7. For each Hamiltonian in the list, we calculate multiplicity and Chern number [D. J. Thouless et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 405 (1982); M. V. Berry, Proc. R. Soc. A 392, 45 (1983); and B. Simon, Phys. Rev. Lett. 51, 2167 (1983)], which are invariant under an arbitrary smooth deformation of the Hamiltonian.

48686,1,"Fitting a function to time-dependent ensemble averaged data Time-dependent ensemble averages, i.e., trajectory-based averages of some observable, are of importance in many fields of science. A crucial objective when interpreting such data is to fit these averages (for instance, squared displacements) with a function and extract parameters (such as diffusion constants). A commonly overlooked challenge in such function fitting procedures is that fluctuations around mean values, by construction, exhibit temporal correlations. We show that the only available general purpose function fitting methods, correlated chi-square method and the weighted least squares method (which neglects correlation), fail at either robust parameter estimation or accurate error estimation. We remedy this by deriving a new closed-form error estimation formula for weighted least square fitting. The new formula uses the full covariance matrix, i.e., rigorously includes temporal correlations, but is free of the robustness issues, inherent to the correlated chi-square method. We demonstrate its accuracy in four examples of importance in many fields: Brownian motion, damped harmonic oscillation, fractional Brownian motion and continuous time random walks. We also successfully apply our method, weighted least squares including correlation in error estimation (WLS-ICE), to particle tracking data. The WLS-ICE method is applicable to arbitrary fit functions, and we provide a publically available WLS-ICE software.",0

Similarly to earlier findings for the other wide-gap alkaline-earth oxide, MgO, hydrogen in BeO is also predicted to be an amphoteric defect with the pinning level, E(), positioned in the mid-gap region. Both donor and acceptor levels were found too deep in the gap to allow for hydrogen to act as a source of free carriers.

On the contrary, a magnetic field parallel to the wire adds linearly dispersed zeroth Landau levels to the traveling modes and increases the conductance.",0
48996,1,"Dirac states in armchair- and zigzag-edged graphene M\""obius strips Edge structure plays an essential role in the nature of electronic states in graphene nanoribbons. By focusing on the interplay between this feature and non-trivial topology in the domain of the Dirac confinement problem, this paper proposes to examine how effects associated with edge shape manifest themselves in conjunction with the topological signature typical of M\""{o}bius strips within a low-energy regime. Aiming to provide an alternative to prevailing tight-binding approaches, zigzag and armchair M\""{o}bius strips are modeled by proposing compatible sets of boundary conditions, prescribing profiles of terminations in both transverse and longitudinal directions which are demonstrated to be coherent in describing consistently transverse edge patterns in combination with a proper M\""{o}bius periodicity. Of particular importance is the absence of constraints on the solution, in contrast with infinite mass analogues, as well as an energy spectrum with a characteristic dual structure responding exclusively to the parity associated with the transverse quantum number. Zigzag ribbons are predicted to possess an intrinsic mechanism for parity inversion, while the armchair ones carry the possibility of a coexistent gapless and gapped band structure. We also inspect the influence of the edge structure on persistent currents. In zigzag-edged configurations they are found to be sensitive to a length-dependent term which behaves as an effective flux. Armchair rings show a quite distinctive property: alternation of constant and flux-dependent currents according to the width of the ring, for a fixed transverse quantum number. In the flux-free case the effects of topology are found to be entirely suppressed, and conventional odd and even currents become undistinguishable.",0
49094,1,"Classical from Quantum We consider the quantum-to-classical transition for macroscopic systems coupled to their environments. By applying Born's Rule, we are led to a particular set of quantum trajectories, or an unravelling, that describes the state of the system from the frame of reference of the subsystem. The unravelling involves a branch dependent Schmidt decomposition of the total state vector. The state in the subsystem frame, the conditioned state, is described by a Poisson process that involves a non-linear deterministic effective Schrodinger equation interspersed with quantum jumps into orthogonal states. We then consider a system whose classical analogue is a generic chaotic system. Although the state spreads out exponentially over phase space, the state in the frame of the subsystem localizes onto a narrow wave packet that follows the classical trajectory due to Ehrenfest's Theorem. Quantum jumps occur with a rate that is the order of the effective Lyapunov exponent of the classical chaotic system and imply that the wave packet undergoes random kicks described by the classical Langevin equation of Brownian motion. The implication of the analysis is that this theory can explain in detail how classical mechanics arises from quantum mechanics by using only unitary evolution and Born's Rule applied to a subsystem.",0

The number of spins that simultaneously reach the critical point is controlled by the length scale in which the magnetic field is modulated, introducing an effective size that favors adiabatic dynamics. The dependence of the residual energy on this length scale and the velocity at which the magnetic field sweeps out the chain is shown to be nonmonotonic.

49734,1,"Molecular gas in two companion cluster galaxies at $z=1.2$ We study the molecular gas properties of two star-forming galaxies separated by 6 kpc in the projected space and belonging to a galaxy cluster selected from the Irac Shallow Cluster Survey, at a redshift $z=1.2$, i.e., $\sim2$ Gyr after the cosmic star formation density peak. This work describes the first CO detection from $1<z<1.4$ star forming cluster galaxies with no reported clear evidence of AGN. We exploit observations taken with the NOEMA interferometer at $\sim3$ mm to detect CO(2-1) line emission from the two selected galaxies, unresolved by our observations. Based on the CO(2-1) spectrum we estimate a total molecular gas mass $M({\rm H_2})=(2.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4})\times10^{10}$ $M_\odot$ and dust mass $M_{\rm dust}<4.2\times10^8~M_\odot$ for the two blended sources. The two galaxies have similar stellar masses and a large relative velocity of $\sim$400 km/s estimated from the CO(2-1) line width. These findings tend to privilege a scenario where both sources contribute to the observed CO(2-1). By using the archival Spitzer MIPS flux at 24$\mu$m we estimate an ${\rm SFR(24\mu m)}=(28^{+12}_{-8})~M_\odot$/yr for each of the two galaxies. Assuming that the two sources equally contribute to the observe CO(2-1) our analysis yields a depletion time scale $\tau_{\rm dep}=(3.9^{+1.4}_{-1.8})\times10^8$ yr, and a molecular gas to stellar mass ratio $0.17\pm0.13$ for each of two sources, separately. Our results are in overall agreement with those of other distant cluster galaxies. The two target galaxies have molecular gas mass and depletion time that are marginally compatible with, but smaller than those of main sequence field galaxies, suggesting that the molecular gas has not been refueled enough. Higher resolution and higher frequency observations will enable us to spatially resolve the two sources and possibly distinguish between different gas processing mechanisms.",0
49774,1,"Reconstruction of Ordinary Differential Equations From Time Series Data We develop a numerical method to reconstruct systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from time series data without {\it a priori} knowledge of the underlying ODEs using sparse basis learning and sparse function reconstruction. We show that employing sparse representations provides more accurate ODE reconstruction compared to least-squares reconstruction techniques for a given amount of time series data. We test and validate the ODE reconstruction method on known 1D, 2D, and 3D systems of ODEs. The 1D system possesses two stable fixed points; the 2D system possesses an oscillatory fixed point with closed orbits; and the 3D system displays chaotic dynamics on a strange attractor. We determine the amount of data required to achieve an error in the reconstructed functions to less than $0.1\%$. For the reconstructed 1D and 2D systems, we are able to match the trajectories from the original ODEs even at long times. For the 3D system with chaotic dynamics, as expected, the trajectories from the original and reconstructed systems do not match at long times, but the reconstructed and original models possess similar Lyapunov exponents. Now that we have validated this ODE reconstruction method on known models, it can be employed in future studies to identify new systems of ODEs using time series data from deterministic systems for which there is no currently known ODE model.",0
49822,1,"Short term fluctuations of wind and solar power systems Wind and solar power are known to be highly influenced by weather events and may ramp up or down abruptly. Such events in the power production influence not only the availability of energy, but also the stability of the entire power grid. By analysing significant amounts of data from several regions around the world with resolutions of seconds to minutes, we provide strong evidence that renewable wind and solar sources exhibit multiple types of variability and nonlinearity in the time scale of seconds and characterise their stochastic properties. In contrast to previous findings, we show that only the jumpy characteristic of renewable sources decreases when increasing the spatial size over which the renewable energies are harvested. Otherwise, the strong non-Gaussian, intermittent behaviour in the cumulative power of the total field survives even for a country-wide distribution of the systems. The strong fluctuating behaviour of renewable wind and solar sources can be well characterised by Kolmogorov-like power spectra and q-exponential probability density functions. Using the estimated potential shape of power time series, we quantify the jumpy or diffusive dynamic of the power. Finally we propose a time delayed feedback technique as a control algorithm to suppress the observed short term non-Gaussian statistics in spatially strong correlated and intermittent renewable sources.",0
49858,1,"Long-Term Cyclicities in Phanerozoic Sea-Level Sedimentary Record and their Potential Drivers Cyclic sedimentation has varied at several timescales and this variability has been geologically well documented at Milankovitch timescales, controlled in part by climatically (insolation) driven sea-level changes. At the longer (tens of Myr) timescales connection between astronomical parameters and sedimentation via cyclic solar-system motions within the Milky Way has also been proposed, but this hypothesis remains controversial because of the lack of long geological records. The absence of a physical mechanism that could explain the connection between climate and astronomy at these longer timescales led to the explanation of plate motions as the main driver of climate on Earth. Here we statistically show a prominent and persistent ~36 Myr sedimentary cyclicity superimposed on two megacycles (~250 Myr) in a relatively well-constrained sea-level (SL) record of the past 542 Myr (Phanerozoic eon). Given the possible link between amplitudes of the ~36 and ~250 Myr cyclicities in SL record and the potential that these periodicities fall into the frequency band of solar system motions, we suggest an astronomical origin, and model these periodicities as originating from the path of the solar system in the Milky Way as vertical and radial periods that modulate the flux of cosmic rays on Earth. Our finding of the ~36 Myr SL cyclicity lends credibility to the existing hypothesis about the imprint of solar-system vertical period on the geological record. The ~250 Myr megacycles are tentatively attributed to a radial period. However, the tectonic drivers also remain potentially plausible. The potential existence of a correlation between the modeled astronomical signal and the geological record may offer an indirect proxy to understand the structure and history of the Milky Way by providing a 542 Myr long record of the path of the Sun in our Galaxy.",0

49965,1,"VIPER - Student research on extraterrestrial ice penetration technology Recent analysis of scientific data from Cassini and earth-based observations gave evidence for a global ocean under a surrounding solid ice shell on Saturn's moon Enceladus. Images of Enceladus' South Pole showed several fissures in the ice shell with plumes constantly exhausting frozen water particles, building up the E-Ring, one of the outer rings of Saturn. In this southern region of Enceladus, the ice shell is considered to be as thin as 2 km, about an order of magnitude thinner than on the rest of the moon. Under the ice shell, there is a global ocean consisting of liquid water. Scientists are discussing different approaches the possibilities of taking samples of water, i.e. by melting through the ice using a melting probe. FH Aachen UAS developed a prototype of maneuverable melting probe which can navigate through the ice that has already been tested successfully in a terrestrial environment. This means no atmosphere and or ambient pressure, low ice temperatures of around 100 to 150 K (near the South Pole) and a very low gravity of 0.114 m/s$^2$ or 1100 {\mu}g. Two of these influencing measures are about to be investigated at FH Aachen UAS in 2017, low ice temperature and low ambient pressure below the triple point of water. Low gravity cannot be easily simulated inside a large experiment chamber, though. Numerical simulations of the melting process at RWTH Aachen however are showing a gravity dependence of melting behavior. Considering this aspect, VIPER provides a link between large-scale experimental simulations at FH Aachen UAS and numerical simulations at RWTH Aachen. To analyze the melting process, about 90 seconds of experiment time in reduced gravity and low ambient pressure is provided by the REXUS rocket.",0
50035,1,"Quantum Simulation of the Quantum Rabi Model in a Trapped Ion The quantum Rabi model, involving a two-level system and a bosonic field mode, is arguably the simplest and most fundamental model describing quantum light-matter interactions. Historically, due to the restricted parameter regimes of natural light-matter processes, the richness of this model has been elusive in the lab. Here, we experimentally realize a quantum simulation of the quantum Rabi model in a single trapped ion, where the coupling strength between the simulated light mode and atom can be tuned at will. The versatility of the demonstrated quantum simulator enables us to experimentally explore the quantum Rabi model in detail, including a wide range of otherwise unaccessible phenomena, as those happening in the ultrastrong and deep strong-coupling regimes. In this sense, we are able to adiabatically generate the ground state of the quantum Rabi model in the deep strong-coupling regime, where we are able to detect the nontrivial entanglement between the bosonic field mode and the two-level system. Moreover, we observe the breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation when the coupling strength is increased, and the generation of phonon wave packets that bounce back and forth when the coupling reaches the deep strong-coupling regime. Finally, we also measure the energy spectrum of the quantum Rabi model in the ultrastrong-coupling regime.",0

50360,1,"Entanglement entropy scaling in solid-state spin arrays via capacitance measurements Solid-state spin arrays are being engineered in varied systems, including gated coupled quantum dots and interacting dopants in semiconductor structures. Beyond quantum computation, these arrays are useful integrated analog simulators for many-body models. As entanglement between individual spins is extremely short ranged in these models, one has to measure the entanglement entropy of a block in order to truly verify their many-body entangled nature. Remarkably, the characteristic scaling of entanglement entropy, predicted by conformal field theory, has yet to be measured. Here, we show that with as few as two replicas of a spin array, and capacitive double-dot singlet-triplet measurements on neighboring spin pairs, the above scaling of the entanglement entropy can be verified. This opens up the controlled simulation of quantum field theories, as we exemplify with uniform chains and Kondo-type impurity models, in engineered solid-state systems. Our procedure remains effective even in the presence of typical imperfections of realistic quantum devices and can be used for thermometry, and to bound entanglement and discord in mixed many-body states.",0

The proposed test could be generalized for statistical testing of any centered non-degenerate Gaussian process. Finally, we examine the test via Monte Carlo simulations for two exemplary scenarios of subdiffusive and superdiffusive dynamics.",0

50595,1,"A reciprocal formulation of non-exponential radiative transfer. 1: Sketch and motivation Previous proposals to permit non-exponential free-path statistics in radiative transfer have not included support for volume and boundary sources that are spatially uncorrelated from the scattering events in the medium. Birth-collision free paths are treated identically to collision-collision free paths and application of this to general, bounded scenes with inclusions leads to non-reciprocal transport. Beginning with reciprocity as a desired property, we propose a new way to integrate non-exponential transport theory into general scenes. We distinguish between the free-path-length statistics between correlated medium particles and the free-path-length statistics beginning at locations not correlated to medium particles, such as boundary surfaces, inclusions and uncorrelated sources. Reciprocity requires that the uncorrelated free-path distributions are simply the normalized transmittance of the correlated free-path distributions. The combination leads to an equilibrium imbedding of a previously derived generalized transport equation into bounded domains. We compare predictions of this approach to Monte Carlo simulation of multiple scattering from negatively-correlated suspensions of monodispersive hard spheres in bounded two-dimensional domains and demonstrate improved performance relative to previous work. We also derive new, exact, reciprocal, single-scattering solutions for plane-parallel half-spaces over a variety of non-exponential media types.",0

We prove that the asymptotic rate of convergence for gauged tangent vectors to the moduli space has a precise polynomial expansion, and hence that the the difference between the two sets of metric coefficients in a certain natural coordinate system also has polynomial decay. Very recent work by Dumas and Neitzke indicates that the convergence rate for the metric is exponential, at least in certain directions.",0

Such radially symmetric linear phase ramps are equivalent to ideal light optical axicons.

Concerning the decimation, we also analyze the worst case scenario in which there is no sharp peak in the tilded-pseudolikelihood function, firstly defined as a criterion to stop the decimation. Techniques are applied to noisy systems with non-linear dynamics, mapped onto multi-variable interacting Hamiltonian effective models for waves and phasors. Results are analyzed varying the number of available samples and the externally tunable temperature-like parameter mimicing real data noise.

Our analysis shows that, looking at the behavior of the inverse graphical problem as data size increases, the methods exposed allow to rule out a wrong hypothesis.",0
51191,1,"Pomelo, a tool for computing Generic Set Voronoi Diagrams of Aspherical Particles of Arbitrary Shape We describe the development of a new software tool, called ""Pomelo"", for the calculation of Set Voronoi diagrams. Voronoi diagrams are a spatial partition of the space around the particles into separate Voronoi cells, e.g. applicable to granular materials. A generalization of the conventional Voronoi diagram for points or monodisperse spheres is the Set Voronoi diagram, also known as navigational map or tessellation by zone of influence. In this construction, a Set Voronoi cell contains the volume that is closer to the surface of one particle than to the surface of any other particle. This is required for aspherical or polydisperse systems. Pomelo is designed to be easy to use and as generic as possible. It directly supports common particle shapes and offers a generic mode, which allows to deal with any type of particles that can be described mathematically. Pomelo can create output in different standard formats, which allows direct visualization and further processing. Finally, we describe three applications of the Set Voronoi code in granular and soft matter physics, namely the problem of packings of ellipsoidal particles with varying degrees of particle-particle friction, mechanical stable packings of tetrahedra and a model for liquid crystal systems of particles with shapes reminiscent of pears",0
51368,1,"Fano fluctuations in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors Because of their universal nature, Fano fluctuations are expected to influence the response of superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). We predict that photon counting rate (PCR) as a function of bias current (IB) in SNSPDs is described by an integral over a transverse coordinate-dependent complementary error function. Fano fluctuations in the amount of energy deposited into the electronic system contribute to the finite width of this error function ΔIB. The local response of an SNSPD can also affect this width: the location of the initial photon absorption site across the width of the wire can impact the probability of vortex-antivortex unbinding and vortex entry from the edges. In narrow-nanowire SNSPDs, the local responses are uniform, and Fano fluctuations dominate ΔIB. We demonstrate good agreement between theory and experiments for a series of bath temperatures and photon energies in narrow-wire WSi SNSPDs. In a wide-nanowire device, the strong local dependence will introduce a finite width to the PCR curve, but with sharp cusps. We show how Fano fluctuations can smooth these features to produce theoretical curves that better match experimental data. We also show that the time-resolved hotspot relaxation curves predicted by Fano fluctuations match the previously measured Lorentzian shapes (except for their tails) over the entire range of bias currents investigated experimentally.",0
51397,1,"Scale-Free Crystallization of two-dimensional Complex Plasmas: Domain Analysis using Minkowski Tensors Experiments of the recrystallization processes in two-dimensional complex plasmas are analyzed in order to rigorously test a recently developed scale-free phase transition theory. The ""Fractal-Domain-Structure"" (FDS) theory is based on the kinetic theory of Frenkel. It assumes the formation of homogeneous domains, separated by defect lines, during crystallization and a fractal relationship between domain area and boundary length. For the defect number fraction and system energy a scale free power-law relation is predicted. The long range scaling behavior of the bond order correlation function shows clearly that the complex plasma phase transitions are not of KTHNY type. Previous preliminary results obtained by counting the number of dislocations and applying a bond order metric for structural analysis are reproduced. These findings are supplemented by extending the use of the bond order metric to measure the defect number fraction and furthermore applying state-of-the-art analysis methods, allowing a systematic testing of the FDS theory with unprecedented scrutiny: A morphological analysis of lattice structure is performed via Minkowski tensor methods. Minkowski tensors form a complete family of additive, motion covariant and continuous morphological measures that are sensitive to non-linear properties. The FDS theory is rigorously confirmed and predictions of the theory are reproduced extremely well. The predicted scale-free power law relation between defect fraction number and system energy is verified for one more order of magnitude at high energies compared to the inherently discontinuous bond order metric. Minkowski Tensor analysis turns out to be a powerful tool for investigations of crystallization processes. It is capable to reveal non-linear local topological properties, however, still provides easily interpretable results founded on a solid mathematical framework.",0

51619,1,"Quantum Gibbs Samplers: The Commuting Case We analyze the problem of preparing quantum Gibbs states of lattice spin Hamiltonians with local and commuting terms on a quantum computer and in nature. Our central result is an equivalence between the behavior of correlations in the Gibbs state and the mixing time of the semigroup which drives the system to thermal equilibrium (the Gibbs sampler). We introduce a framework for analyzing the correlation and mixing properties of quantum Gibbs states and quantum Gibbs samplers, which is rooted in the theory of non-commutative ${\mathbb{L}_p}$ spaces. We consider two distinct classes of Gibbs samplers, one of them being the well-studied Davies generator modelling the dynamics of a system due to weak-coupling with a large Markovian environment. We show that their spectral gap is independent of system size if, and only if, a certain strong form of clustering of correlations holds in the Gibbs state. Therefore every Gibbs state of a commuting Hamiltonian that satisfies clustering of correlations in this strong sense can be prepared efficiently on a quantum computer. As concrete applications of our formalism, we show that for every one-dimensional lattice system, or for systems in lattices of any dimension at temperatures above a certain threshold, the Gibbs samplers of commuting Hamiltonians are always gapped, giving an efficient way of preparing the associated Gibbs states on a quantum computer.",0

The initial state of the system is drawn from a known Gaussian distribution, and the final state distribution is required to reach a given target Gaussian distribution, while minimizing the expected value of the control effort. We derive the linear optimal control policy by first presenting an efficient solution for the diffusion-less case, and we then solve the case with diffusion by reformulating the system as a superposition of diffusion-less systems. This reformulation leads to a simple condition for the solution, which can be effectively solved using numerical methods. We show that the resulting solution coincides with a LQG problem with particular terminal cost weight matrix. This fact provides an additional justification for using a linear in state controller. In addition, it allows an efficient iterative implementation of the controller.",0
51729,1,"Geometric structures, fractal self-similarity, squeezed coherent states and electrodynamics The formalism describing fractal self-similar structures has been shown in recent works to be isomorphic to the one of a system of damped/amplified oscillators, which is a prototype of a dissipative system and of the environment in which it is embedded, and to squeezed coherent states. Fractal-like structures appear to be generated by coherent quantum condensation processes, and thus they appear as macroscopic quantum systems, as it happens with crystals, ferromagnets, superconductors and like systems characterized by ordered patterns. In this report, by resorting to such results it is shown that in space-time regions where the magnetic field may be approximated to be constant and the electric field is derivable from a harmonic potential, the isomorphism also exists between electrodynamics and fractal-like structures. A link is thus established between self-similarity, dissipation, coherent states and electrodynamics. The relation between quantum dissipation and non-commutative geometry in the plane is also commented upon. The macroscopic appearances (forms) of the fractals seem to emerge out of a process of morphogenesis as the macroscopic manifestation of the underlying dissipative, coherent quantum dynamics.",0

In this paper, we investigate the joint subcarrier (SC) assignment and power allocation problem for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) amplify-and-forward two-way relay wireless networks, in the presence of eavesdroppers. By exploiting cooperative jamming (CJ) to enhance the security of the communication link, we aim to maximize the achievable secrecy energy efficiency by jointly designing the SC assignment, user pair scheduling and power allocation. Assuming the perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at the relay station, we propose a low-complexity subcarrier assignment scheme (SCAS-1), which is equivalent to many-to-many matching games, and then SCAS-2 is formulated as a secrecy energy efficiency maximization problem.

51834,1,"Adjusting the fairshare policy to prevent computing power loss On a typical WLCG site providing batch access to computing resources according to a fairshare policy, the idle time lapse after a job ends and before a new one begins on a given slot is negligible if compared to the duration of typical jobs. The overall amount of these intervals over a time window increases with the size of the cluster and the inverse of job duration and can be considered equivalent to an average number of unavailable slots over that time window. This value has been investigated for the Tier-1 at CNAF, and observed to occasionally grow and reach up to more than the 10% of the about 20,000 available computing slots. Analysis reveals that this happens when a sustained rate of short jobs is submitted to the cluster and dispatched by the batch system. Because of how the default fairshare policy works, it increases the dynamic priority of those users mostly submitting short jobs, since they are not accumulating runtime, and will dispatch more of their jobs at the next round, thus worsening the situation until the submission flow ends. To address this problem the default behaviour of the fairshare have been altered by adding a correcting term to the default formula for the dynamic priority. The LSF batch system, currently adopted at CNAF, provides a way to define its value by invoking a C function, which returns it for each user in the cluster. The correcting term works by rounding up to a minimum defined runtime the most recently done jobs. Doing so, each short job looks almost like a regular one and the dynamic priority value settles to a proper value. The net effect is a reduction of the dispatching rate of short jobs and, consequently, the average number of available slots greatly improves. Furthermore, a potential starvation problem, actually observed at least once is also prevented. After describing short jobs and reporting about their impact on the cluster, possible workarounds are discussed and the selected solution is motivated. Details on the most critical aspects of the implementation are explained and the observed results are presented.",0

51981,1,"Energy transfer in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence Magnetic fields, compressibility, and turbulence are important factors in many terrestrial and astrophysical processes. While energy dynamics, i.e., how energy is transferred within and between kinetic and magnetic reservoirs, has been previously studied in the context of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we extend shell-to-shell energy transfer analysis to the compressible regime. We derive four new transfer functions specifically capturing compressibility effects in the kinetic and magnetic cascade, and capturing energy exchange via magnetic pressure. To illustrate their viability, we perform and analyze four simulations of driven isothermal MHD turbulence in the sub- and supersonic regime with two different codes. On the one hand, our analysis reveals robust characteristics across regime and numerical method. For example, energy transfer between individual scales is local and forward for both cascades with the magnetic cascade being stronger than the kinetic one. Magnetic tension and magnetic pressure related transfers are less local and weaker than the cascades. We find no evidence for significant nonlocal transfer. On the other hand, we show that certain functions, e.g., the compressive component of the magnetic energy cascade, exhibit a more complex behavior that varies both with regime and numerical method. Having established a basis for the analysis in the compressible regime, the method can now be applied to study a broader parameter space.",0

This Laurent polynomial is invariant under $q \leftrightarrow q^{-1}$ (after replacing $c_1 \leftrightarrow -c_1$). For some choices of $c_1,c_2$ these open subsets equal the entire moduli space.

Here we perform an analysis on the topology and stability of equilibrium magnetization states for a thin spherical shell with easy-axis anisotropy in normal directions. Skyrmion solutions are found for a range of parameters. These magnetic skyrmions on a spherical shell have two distinct differences compared to their planar counterpart: (i) they are topologically trivial and (ii) can be stabilized by curvature effects, even when Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions are absent. Due to its specific topological nature a skyrmion on a spherical shell can be simply induced by a uniform external magnetic field.",0
52656,1,"Degeneracy loci, virtual cycles and nested Hilbert schemes Given a map of vector bundles on a smooth variety, consider the deepest degeneracy locus where its rank is smallest. We show it carries a natural perfect obstruction theory whose virtual cycle can be calculated by the Thom-Porteous formula. We apply this to nested Hilbert schemes of points and curves on surfaces, by showing they can be expressed both as degeneracy loci and as ""reduced"" degeneracy loci. The resulting virtual cycles agree with the ones coming from DT and VW theories respectively. This enables us to compute some DT and VW invariants in terms of Carlsson-Okounkov operators, proving and extending a conjecture of Gholampour-Sheshmani-Yau. We also generalise a vanishing result of Carlsson-Okounkov.",0
52736,1,"Nanoscale interfacial defect shedding in a growing nematic droplet Interfacial defect shedding is the most recent known mechanism for defect formation in a thermally driven isotropic-to-nematic phase transition. It manifests in nematic-isotropic interfaces going through an anchoring switch. Numerical computations in planar geometry established that a growing nematic droplet can undergo interfacial defect shedding, nucleating interfacial defect structures that shed into the bulk as +12 point defects. By extending the study of interfacial defect shedding in a growing nematic droplet to larger length and time scales, and to three dimensions, we unveil an oscillatory growth mode involving shape and anchoring transitions that results in a controllable regular distributions of point defects in planar geometry, and complex structures of disclination lines in three dimensions.",0

52891,1,"Causality Testing: A Data Compression Framework Causality testing, the act of determining cause and effect from measurements, is widely used in physics, climatology, neuroscience, econometrics and other disciplines. As a result, a large number of causality testing methods based on various principles have been developed. Causal relationships in complex systems are typically accompanied by entropic exchanges which are encoded in patterns of dynamical measurements. A data compression algorithm which can extract these encoded patterns could be used for inferring these relations. This motivates us to propose, for the first time, a generic causality testing framework based on data compression. The framework unifies existing causality testing methods and enables us to innovate a novel Compression-Complexity Causality measure. This measure is rigorously tested on simulated and real-world time series and is found to overcome the limitations of Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, especially for noisy and non-synchronous measurements. Additionally, it gives insight on the `kind' of causal influence between input time series by the notions of positive and negative causality.",0

53022,1,"Cross section alignment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by anisotropic radiation We study the effect of anisotropic radiation illumination on the alignment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and report that cross-sectional mechanism of alignment earlier considered in terms of gas-grain interactions can also be efficient for the photon-grain interaction. We demonstrate this by first calculating the angle-dependence rotational damping and excitation coefficients by photon absorption followed by infrared emission. We then calculate the degree of PAH alignment for the different environments and physical parameters, including the illumination direction, ionization fraction, and magnetic field strength. For the reflection nebula (RN) conditions with unidirectional radiation field, we find that the degree of alignment tends to increase with increasing the angle $\psi$ between the illumination direction and the magnetic field, as a result of the decrease of the cross-section of photon absorption with $\psi$. We calculate the polarization of spinning PAH emission using the obtained degree of alignment for the different physical parameters, assuming constant grain temperatures. We find that the polarization of spinning PAH emission from RN can be large, between $5-20~\%$ at frequencies $\nu > 20$ GHz, whereas the polarization is less than $3~\%$ for photodissociation regions (PDRs). In realistic conditions, the polarization is expected to be lower due to grain temperature fluctuations and magnetic field geometry. The polarization for the diffuse cold neutral medium (CNM) is rather low, below $1~\%$ at $\nu>20$ GHz, consistent with observations by WMAP and Planck. Our results demonstrate that the RNe are the favored environment to observe the polarization of spinning dust emission as well as polarized mid-IR emission from PAHs.",0

In this research, we developed a stereo vision system providing qualified point cloud data of the object. A modified and improved iterative closest point algorithm is applied to recognize the targeted object greatly avoiding the local minimum in template matching. Moreover, a stereo vision guided teleoperation control algorithm using virtual fixtures technology is adopted to enhance robot teaching ability. Combining these two functions, the mobile manipulator is able to learn semi-autonomously and work autonomously.

Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7 are dipolar spin ices, now often described as hosts of emergent magnetic monopole excitations; the low-temperature state of Tb2Ti2O7 has features of both spin liquids and spin glasses, and strong magnetoelastic coupling. We measured the crystal-field excitations of all three compounds and obtained a unified set of crystal-field parameters.

53090,1,"Adaptive inversion algorithm for 1.5 um visibility lidar incorporating in situ Angstrom wavelength exponent As one of the most popular applications of lidar systems, the atmospheric visibility is defined to be inversely proportional to the atmospheric extinction coefficient at 0.55 um. Since the laser at 1.5 um shows the highest maximum permissible exposure in the wavelength ranging from 0.3 um to 10 um, the eye-safe 1.5 um lidar can be deployed in urban areas. In such a case, the measured extinction coefficient at 1.5 um should be converted to that at 0.55 um for visibility retrieval. Although several models have been established since 1962, the accurate wavelength conversion remains a challenge. An adaptive inversion algorithm for 1.5 um visibility lidar is proposed and demonstrated by using the in situ Angstrom wavelength exponent, which is derived from either a sun photometer or an aerosol spectrometer. The impact of the particle size distribution of atmospheric aerosols and the Rayleigh backscattering of atmospheric molecules are taken into account. In comparison, the Angstrom wavelength exponent derived from the sun photometer is 7.7% higher than that derived from the aerosol spectrometer. Then, using 1.5 um visibility lidar, the visibility with a temporal resolution of 5 min is detected over 48 hours in Hefei (31.83 N, 117.25 E). The average visibility error between the new method and a visibility sensor (Vaisala, PWD52) is 5.2% with the R-square value of 0.96, while the relative error between another reference visibility lidar at 532 nm and the visibility sensor is 6.7% with the R-square value of 0.91.

53214,1,"Anomaly Detection in Clutter using Spectrally Enhanced Ladar Discrete return (DR) Laser Detection and Ranging (Ladar) systems provide a series of echoes that reflect from objects in a scene. These can be first, last or multi-echo returns. In contrast, Full-Waveform (FW)-Ladar systems measure the intensity of light reflected from objects continuously over a period of time. In a camouflaged scenario, e.g., objects hidden behind dense foliage, a FW-Ladar penetrates such foliage and returns a sequence of echoes including buried faint echoes. The aim of this paper is to learn local-patterns of co-occurring echoes characterised by their measured spectra. A deviation from such patterns defines an abnormal event in a forest/tree depth profile. As far as the authors know, neither DR or FW-Ladar, along with several spectral measurements, has not been applied to anomaly detection. This work presents an algorithm that allows detection of spectral and temporal anomalies in FW-Multi Spectral Ladar (FW-MSL) data samples. An anomaly is defined as a full waveform temporal and spectral signature that does not conform to a prior expectation, represented using a learnt subspace (dictionary) and set of coefficients that capture co-occurring local-patterns using an overlapping temporal window. A modified optimization scheme is proposed for subspace learning based on stochastic approximations. The objective function is augmented with a discriminative term that represents the subspace's separability properties and supports anomaly characterisation. The algorithm detects several man-made objects and anomalous spectra hidden in a dense clutter of vegetation and also allows tree species classification.",0
53378,1,Accelerated Parameter Estimation with DALE$\chi$ We consider methods for improving the estimation of constraints on a high-dimensional parameter space with a computationally expensive likelihood function. In such cases Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can take a long time to converge and concentrates on finding the maxima rather than the often-desired confidence contours for accurate error estimation. We employ DALE$\chi$ (Direct Analysis of Limits via the Exterior of $\chi^2$) for determining confidence contours by minimizing a cost function parametrized to incentivize points in parameter space which are both on the confidence limit and far from previously sampled points. We compare DALE$\chi$ to the nested sampling algorithm implemented in MultiNest on a toy likelihood function that is highly non-Gaussian and non-linear in the mapping between parameter values and $\chi^2$. We find that in high-dimensional cases DALE$\chi$ finds the same confidence limit as MultiNest using roughly an order of magnitude fewer evaluations of the likelihood function. DALE$\chi$ is open-source and available at https://github.com/danielsf/Dalex.git.,0
53477,1,"Analyzing a stochastic process driven by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise A scalar Langevin-type process X(t) that is driven by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise η(t) is non-Markovian. However, the joint dynamics of X and η is described by a Markov process in two dimensions. But even though there exists a variety of techniques for the analysis of Markov processes, it is still a challenge to estimate the process parameters solely based on a given time series of X. Such a partially observed 2D process could, e.g., be analyzed in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Alternatively, an embedding strategy can be applied, where first the joint dynamics of X and its temporal derivative Ẋ is analyzed. Subsequently, the results can be used to determine the process parameters of X and η. In this paper, we propose a more direct approach that is purely based on the moments of the increments of X, which can be estimated for different time-increments τ from a given time series. From a stochastic Taylor expansion of X, analytic expressions for these moments can be derived, which can be used to estimate the process parameters by a regression strategy.",0

Based on the method of multiple scales, a system comprising a vector nonlinear Schrodinger equation for the transverse envelopes of the self-consistent plasma wakefield, coupled to a scalar nonlinear Schrodinger equation for the electron current velocity envelope, has been derived. Using the method of formal series of Dubois-Violette, a traveling wave solution of the derived set of coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations in the case of circular wave polarization has been obtained. This solution is represented as a ratio of two formal Volterra series. The terms of these series can be calculated explicitly to every desired order.",0

Consider the space $T(M)$ of all simplicial isomorphism classes of triangulations of $M$ endowed with the metric defined as the minimal number of bistellar transformations required to transform one of two considered triangulations into the other. Our main result is the existence of an absolute constant $C>1$ such that for every $m$ and all sufficiently large $N$ there exist more than $C^N$ triangulations of $M$ with at most $N$ simplices such that pairwise distances between them are greater than $2^{2^{\ldots^{2^N}}}$ ($m$ times). This result follows from a similar result for the space of all balanced presentations of the trivial group. (""Balanced"" means that the number of generators equals to the number of relations). This space is endowed with the metric defined as the minimal number of Tietze transformations between finite presentations. We prove a similar exponential lower bound for the number of balanced presentations of length $\leq N$ with four generators that are pairwise $2^{2^{\ldots^{2^N}}}$-far from each other. If one does not fix the number of generators, then we establish a super-exponential lower bound $N^{const\ N}$ for the number of balanced presentations of length $\leq N$ that are $2^{2^{\ldots^{2^N}}}$-far from each other.",0

Thereby, a refinement of the parameters of the RC catalog sources (RATAN Cold) for this interval is complete. To date, the RCR catalog (RATAN Cold Refined) covers the right-ascension interval $2^h$< RA <$17^h$ and includes 830 sources.

We found that at 150 MHz in most sources the spectral index $\alpha_{0.5}$ gets steeper with increasing flux density. In general, the sources with flat spectra are weaker in terms of flux density than the sources with steep spectra, which especially differs at 150 MHz. We believe that this is due to the brightness of their extended components, which can be determined by the type of accretion and the neighborhood of the source.",0

The temperature dependence for shape-resonances is well established; however, no experimental information is available yet on the second mechanism. Here, we show that the dissociation cross section for VFRs mediated by the formation of a dipole bound anion decreases as a function of a temperature. The change remains, however, relatively small in the temperature range of 370-440 K but it might be more pronounced at the extended temperature range.",0

54607,1,"Deactivation of lowest excited state of uranyl in the presence of acetate: A DFT exploration Interaction of uranyl with acetate is studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Particular attention is given to the interaction of excited uranyl with acetate to explain the quenching in aqueous solution and the photodecomposition of acetate in the presence of uranyl. The structures of uranyl with the acetate ion in monodentate and bidentante coordinations are calculated in the ground and in the lowest lying excited triplet state. Uranyl-acetate is found to be stable in both coordinations in the lowest lying triplet state. Uranyl can also form a number of stable structures with acetate involving apical oxygen in the triplet state. The photoreduction of U(VI) associated with hydrogen abstraction from ligand is observed in the case of uranyl coordinated by two molecules of acetic acid in monodentate and apical modes. The stability of the [UO(OH)(H2O)4]2+ species is also examined in the ground state. It is found that this structure is stable. These species may play a key role in the dynamic quenching of uranyl. The structures of [UO(OH)(H2O)4]2+ coordinated with acetate in monodentate and bidentate modes are also investigated.

In the mean field approximation of the Son's formalism, there is a common pairing structure that underlines the possibilities for paired ground states in both systems. We argue that the particle-hole (PH) Pfaffian state in the (particle-hole symmetric) half-filled LL of a monolayer, and analogous state in the PH symmetric bilayer (in which each layer is half-filled LL) can be considered as critical states, i.e., states that cannot describe a phase under PH symmetry. We point out that the inclusion of a PH symmetry breaking (like LL mixing) may stabilize the PH Pfaffian in a monolayer. In the bilayer case, in numerical experiments on a sphere, by choosing the PH symmetric shift, we can stabilize the interlayer correlated (111) excitonic state or critical state, for any distance between the layers, but in general, with no bias, the evolution of the bilayer includes other phases.",0

55072,1,"Numerical Problems in Coupling Photon Momentum (Radiation Pressure) to Gas Radiation pressure (RP; or photon momentum absorbed by gas) is important in a tremendous range of astrophysical systems. But we show the usual method for assigning absorbed photon momentum to gas in numerical radiation-hydrodynamics simulations (simply integrating over cell volumes or evaluating at cell/particle centers) can severely under-estimate the correct RP force around sources, unless photon mean-free-paths are highly-resolved in the fluid grid. The existence of this error is independent of the numerical radiation transfer (RT) method (even in exact ray-tracing/Monte-Carlo methods), because it depends on how the RT solution is interpolated back onto fluid elements. Brute-force convergence (resolving mean-free paths) is impossible in many cases (especially where high-opacity UV/ionizing photons are involved). Instead, we show a 'face-integrated' method -- integrating and applying the momentum fluxes at interfaces between fluid elements -- reproduces the correct solution at all resolution levels. The 'fix' is simple and we provide example implementations for ray-tracing, Monte-Carlo, and moments RT methods in both grid and mesh-free fluid schemes. We consider an example problem of star formation in a molecular cloud with single-scattering UV/ionizing RP. At state-of-the-art resolution, cell-integrated methods under-estimate the effects of RP by an order of magnitude, leading (incorrectly) to the conclusion that RP is unimportant, while face-integrated methods predict strong self-regulation of star formation and rapid cloud destruction via RP.",0

Also, such topology presents an obstruction to representing bands in terms of symmetric, exponentially localized Wannier functions. Here, we address the converse question: Do obstructions to Wannier representations imply stable band topology? We answer this in the negative, pointing out that some bands can also display a distinct type of ""fragile topology."" Bands with fragile topology admit a Wannier representation if and only if additional trivial degrees of freedom are supplied. We apply this notion to solve a puzzle in diagnosing band topology: A recent work [Nature 547, 298-305 (2017)] made the intriguing suggestion that whenever a so-called ""elementary band representation"" splits, the two sets of bands, separated by a band gap, are individually topological. Here, we construct a counterexample, defined on the honeycomb lattice, which features a split elementary band. We show that one of the two disconnected bands is completely trivial with exponentially localized, symmetric Wannier functions. This presents a conundrum regarding the nature of the second band, which is resolved by recognizing that it is topological, but in the fragile sense. Our model thus provides a physical example of fragile topology.",0

55571,1,"Segmentation of nearly isotropic overlapped tracks in photomicrographs using successive erosions as watershed markers The major challenges of automatic track counting are distinguishing tracks and material defects, identifying small tracks and defects of similar size, and detecting overlapping tracks. Here we address the latter issue using WUSEM, an algorithm which combines the watershed transform, morphological erosions and labeling to separate regions in photomicrographs. WUSEM shows reliable results when used in photomicrographs presenting almost isotropic objects. We tested this method in two datasets of diallyl phthalate (DAP) photomicrographs and compared the results when counting manually and using the classic watershed. The mean automatic/manual efficiency ratio when using WUSEM in the test datasets is 0.97 +/- 0.11.",0
55620,1,"Magnetic Force Microscopy Imaging Using Geometrically Constrained Nano-Domain Walls Domain wall probes (DW-probes) were custom-made by modifying standard commercial magnetic force microscopy (MFM) probes using focused ion beam lithography. Excess of magnetic coating from the probes was milled out, leaving a V-shaped nanostructure on one face of the probe apex. Owing to the nanostructure's shape anisotropy, such probe has four possible magnetic states depending on the direction of the magnetization along each arm of the V-shape. Two states of opposite polarity are characterised by the presence of a geometrically constrained DW, pinned at the corner of the V-shape nanostructure. In the other two states, the magnetization curls around the corner with opposite chirality. Electron holography studies, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrate that a strong stray field emanates from the pinned DW, whilst a much weaker stray field is generated by the curling configurations. Using in situ MFM, we show that the magnetization states of the DW-probe can be easily controlled by applying an external magnetic field, thereby demonstrating that this type of probe can be used as a switchable tool with a low or high stray field intensity. We demonstrate that DW-probes enable acquiring magnetic images with a negligible interference with the sample magnetization, similar to that of commercial low moment probes, but with a higher magnetic contrast. In addition, the DW-probe in the curl state provides complementary information about the in-plane component of the sample's magnetization, which is not achievable by standard methods and provides additional information about the stray fields, e.g. as when imaging DWs.",0
55808,1,"Equation-free analysis of a dynamically evolving multigraph In order to illustrate the adaptation of traditional continuum numerical techniques to the study of complex network systems, we use the equation-free framework to analyze a dynamically evolving multigraph. This approach is based on coupling short intervals of direct dynamic network simulation with appropriately-defined lifting and restriction operators, mapping the detailed network description to suitable macroscopic (coarse-grained) variables and back. This enables the acceleration of direct simulations through Coarse Projective Integration (CPI), as well as the identification of coarse stationary states via a Newton-GMRES method. We also demonstrate the use of data-mining, both linear (principal component analysis, PCA) and nonlinear (diffusion maps, DMAPS) to determine good macroscopic variables (observables) through which one can coarse-grain the model. These results suggest methods for decreasing simulation times of dynamic real-world systems such as epidemiological network models. Additionally, the data-mining techniques could be applied to a diverse class of problems to search for a succint, low-dimensional description of the system in a small number of variables.",0
55844,1,"The nature of luminous Lyman-alpha emitters at z~2-3: maximal dust-poor starbursts and highly ionising AGN Deep narrow-band surveys have revealed a large population of faint Lyman-alpha (Lya) emitters (LAEs) in the distant Universe, but relatively little is known about the most luminous sources ($L_{Ly\alpha}>10^{42.7}$ erg/s; $L_{Ly\alpha}>L^*_{Ly\alpha}$). Here we present the spectroscopic follow-up of 21 luminous LAEs at z~2-3 found with panoramic narrow-band surveys over five independent extragalactic fields (~4x10$^6$ Mpc$^{3}$ surveyed at z~2.2 and z~3.1). We use WHT/ISIS, Keck/DEIMOS and VLT/X-SHOOTER to study these sources using high ionisation UV lines. Luminous LAEs at z~2-3 have blue UV slopes ($\beta=-2.0^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$), high Lya escape fractions ($50^{+20}_{-15}$%) and span five orders of magnitude in UV luminosity ($M_{UV}\approx-19$ to -24). Many (70%) show at least one high ionisation rest-frame UV line such as CIV, NV, CIII], HeII or OIII], typically blue-shifted by ~100-200 km/s relative to Lya. Their Lya profiles reveal a wide variety of shapes, including significant blue-shifted components and widths from 200 to 4000 km/s. Overall, 60+-11% appear to be AGN dominated, and at $L_{Ly\alpha}>10^{43.3}$ erg/s and/or $M_{UV}<-21.5$ virtually all LAEs are AGN with high ionisation parameters (log U=0.6+-0.5) and with metallicities of ~0.5-1 Zsun. Those lacking signatures of AGN (40+-11%) have lower ionisation parameters ($\log U=-3.0^{+1.6}_{-0.9}$ and $\log\xi_{\rm ion}=25.4\pm0.2$) and are apparently metal-poor sources likely powered by young, dust-poor ""maximal"" starbursts. Our results show that luminous LAEs at z~2-3 are a diverse population and that 2xL$^*_{Ly\alpha}$ and 2xM$_{UV}^*$ mark a sharp transition in the nature of LAEs, from star formation dominated to AGN dominated.",0

The wave function for this parton state is $\mathcal{P}_{\rm LLL} \Phi_{1}^3[\Phi_{2}^{*}]^{2}\sim\Psi^{2}_{2/3}/\Phi_{1}$ and in the spherical geometry it occurs at the anti-Pfaffian flux. It has a good overlap with the anti-Pfaffian state and with the second Landau level Coulomb state of ordinary semi-conductors such as GaAs. By calculating the entanglement spectrum we show that this state lies in the same phase as the anti-Pfaffian state. A major advantage of this parton state is that its wave function can be evaluated for large systems, which makes it amenable to variational calculations.",0

Gauge modules are generalizations of modules of tensor densities whose construction was inspired by non-abelian gauge theory.

56202,1,"Generation and amplification of a high-order sideband induced by two-level atoms in a hybrid optomechanical system It is quite important to enhance and control the optomechanically induced high-order sideband generation to achieve low-power optical comb and high-sensitivity sensing with an integrable structure. Here we present and analyze a proposal for enhancement and manipulation of optical nonlinearity and high-order sideband generation in a hybrid atom-cavity optomechanical system that is coherently driven by a bichromatic input field consisting of a control field and a probe field and that works beyond the perturbative regime. Our numerical analysis with experimentally achievable parameters confirms that robust high-order sideband generation and typical spectral structures with nonperturbative features can be created even under weak driven fields. The dependence of the high-order sideband generation on the atomic parameters are also discussed in detail, including the decay rate of the atoms and the coupling parameter between the atoms and the cavity field. We show that the cutoff order as well as the amplitude of the higher-order sidebands can be well tuned by the atomic coupling strength and the atomic decay rate. The proposed mechanism of enhancing optical nonlinearity is quite general and can be adopted to optomechanical systems with different types of cavity.",0

56501,1,"Causes and importance of new particle formation in the present-day and preindustrial atmospheres New particle formation has been estimated to produce around half of cloud-forming particlesin the present-day atmosphere, via gas-to-particle conversion. Here we assess the importance of newparticle formation (NPF) for both the present-day and the preindustrial atmospheres. We use a globalaerosol model with parametrizations of NPF from previously published CLOUD chamber experimentsinvolving sulfuric acid, ammonia, organic molecules, and ions. We find that NPF produces around 67% ofcloud condensation nuclei at 0.2% supersaturation (CCN0.2%) at the level of low clouds in the preindustrialatmosphere (estimated uncertainty range 45–84%)and 54% in the present day (estimated uncertaintyrange 38–66%). Concerning causes, we find that the importance of biogenic volatile organic compounds(BVOCs) in NPF and CCN formation is greater than previously thought. Removing BVOCs and hence allsecondary organic aerosol from our model reduces low-cloud-level CCN concentrations at 0.2%supersaturation by 26% in the present-day atmosphere and 41% in the preindustrial. Around three quartersof this reduction is due to the tiny fraction of the oxidation products of BVOCs that have sufficiently lowvolatility to be involved in NPF and early growth. Furthermore, we estimate that 40% of preindustrialCCN0.2% are formed via ion-induced NPF, compared with 27% in the present day, although we caution thatthe ion-induced fraction of NPF involving BVOCs is poorly measured at present. Our model suggests that theeffect of changes in cosmic ray intensity on CCN is small and unlikely to be comparable to the effect of largevariations in natural primary aerosol emissions",0
56558,1,"Information-reality complementarity in photonic weak measurements The emergence of realistic properties is a key problem in understanding the quantum-to-classical transition. In this respect, measurements represent a way to interface quantum systems with the macroscopic world: these can be driven in the weak regime, where a reduced back-action can be imparted by choosing meter states able to extract different amounts of information. Here we explore the implications of such weak measurement for the variation of realistic properties of two-level quantum systems pre- and postmeasurement, and extend our investigations to the case of open systems implementing the measurements.",0
56567,1,"Phase-space curvature in spin-orbit-coupled ultracold atomic systems We consider a system with spin-orbit coupling and derive equations of motion which include the effects of Berry curvatures. We apply these equations to investigate the dynamics of particles with equal Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling in one dimension. In our derivation, the adiabatic transformation is performed first and leads to quantum Heisenberg equations of motion for momentum and position operators. These equations explicitly contain position-space, momentum-space, and phase-space Berry curvature terms. Subsequently, we perform the semiclassical approximation and obtain the semiclassical equations of motion. Taking the low-Berry-curvature limit results in equations that can be directly compared to previous results for the motion of wave packets. Finally, we show that in the semiclassical regime, the effective mass of the equal Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit-coupled system can be viewed as a direct effect of the phase-space Berry curvature.",0

56825,1,"Size growth of red-sequence early-type galaxies in clusters in the last 10 Gyr We carried out a photometric and structural analysis in the rest-frame V band of a mass-selected (logM/M_&#8857;> 10.7) sample of red-sequence galaxies in 14 galaxy clusters, 6 of which are at z> 1.45, namely JKCS041, IDCS J1426.5+3508, SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, SpARCSJ021524-034331, XDCPJ0044.0-2033, and SPT-CLJ2040-4451. To this end, we reduced/analyzed about 300 orbits of multicolor images taken with the Advanced Camera for Survey and the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope. We uniformly morphologically classified galaxies from z = 0.023 to z = 1.803, and we homogeneously derived sizes (effective radii) for the entire sample. Furthermore, our size derivation allows, and therefore is not biased by, the presence of the usual variety of morphological structures seen in early-type galaxies, such as bulges, bars, disks, isophote twists, and ellipiticy gradients. By using such a mass-selected sample, composed of 244 red-sequence early-type galaxies, we find that the log of the galaxy size at a fixed stellar mass, logM/M_&#8857; = 11, has increased with time at a rate of 0.023 +- 0.002 dex perGyr over the last 10 Gyr, in marked contrast with the threefold increase found in the literature for galaxies in the general field over the same period. This suggests, at face value, that secular processes should be excluded as the primary drivers of size evolution because we observed an environmental dependent size growth. Using spectroscopic ages of Coma early-type galaxies we also find that recently quenched early-type galaxies are a numerically minor population not different enough in size to alter the mean size at a given mass, which implies that the progenitor bias is minor, i.e., that the size evolution measured by selecting galaxies at the redshift of observation is indistinguishable from the one that compares ancestors and descendents.",0

56866,1,"Gold-Patched Graphene Nanoribbons for High-Responsivity and Ultrafast Photodetection from Visible to Infrared Regimes Graphene is a very attractive material for broadband photodetection in hyperspectral imaging and sensing systems. However, its potential use has been hindered by tradeoffs between the responsivity, bandwidth, and operation speed of existing graphene photodetectors. Here, we present engineered photoconductive nanostructures based on gold-patched graphene nanoribbons, which enable simultaneous broadband and ultrafast photodetection with high responsivity. These nanostructures merge the advantages of broadband optical absorption, ultrafast photocarrier transport, and carrier multiplication in graphene nanoribbons with the ultrafast transport of photocarriers to the gold patches before recombination. Through this approach, high-responsivity operation is achieved without the use of bandwidth- and speed-limiting quantum dots, defect states, or tunneling barriers. We demonstrate high-responsivity photodetection from the visible to the infrared regime (0.6 A/W at 0.8 {\mu}m and 11.5 A/W at 20 {\mu}m) with operation speeds exceeding 50 GHz. Our results demonstrate an improvement of the response times by more than seven orders of magnitude and an increase in bandwidths of one order of magnitude compared to those of higher-responsivity graphene photodetectors based on quantum dots and tunneling barriers.",0

This yields regularity for fixed point vertex operator subalgebras under the action of any finite solvable group. As an application, we obtain an $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-compatibility between twisted twining characters for commuting finite order automorphisms of holomorphic vertex operator algebras. This resolves one of the principal claims in the Generalized Moonshine conjecture.",0
56946,1,"Determination of the edge of criticality in echo state networks through Fisher information maximization It is a widely accepted fact that the computational capability of recurrent neural networks is maximized on the so-called ""edge of criticality"". Once the network operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific application both in terms of (i) low prediction error and (ii) high short-term memory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly influenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal, application-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still missing. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by proposing a theoretically motivated, unsupervised method based on Fisher information for determining the edge of criticality in recurrent neural networks. It is proven that Fisher information is maximized for (finite-size) systems operating in such critical regions. However, Fisher information is notoriously difficult to compute and either requires the probability density function or the conditional dependence of the system states with respect to the model parameters. The paper takes advantage of a recently-developed non-parametric estimator of the Fisher information matrix and provides a method to determine the critical region of echo state networks, a particular class of recurrent networks. The considered control parameters, which indirectly affect the echo state network performance, are explored to identify those configurations lying on the edge of criticality and, as such, maximizing Fisher information and computational performance. Experimental results on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0
56947,1,"Formation of the Andromeda Giant Stream: Asymmetric Structure and Disc Progenitor We focus on the evidence of a past minor merger discovered in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). Previous N-body studies have enjoyed moderate success in producing the observed giant stellar stream (GSS) and stellar shells in M31's halo. The observed distribution of stars in the halo of M31 shows an asymmetric surface brightness profile across the GSS; however, the effect of the morphology of the progenitor galaxy on the internal structure of the GSS requires further investigation in theoretical studies. To investigate the physical connection between the characteristic surface brightness in the GSS and the morphology of the progenitor dwarf galaxy, we systematically vary the thickness, rotation velocity and initial inclination of the disc dwarf galaxy in N-body simulations. The formation of the observed structures appears to be dominated by the progenitor's rotation. Besides reproducing the observed GSS and two shells in detail, we predict additional structures for further observations. We predict the detectability of the progenitor's stellar core in the phase-space density distribution, azimuthal metallicity gradient of the western shell-like structure and an additional extended shell in the north-western direction that may constrain the properties of the progenitor galaxy.",0
56973,1,"Cosmologists in Search of Planet Nine: the Case for CMB Experiments Cosmology experiments at millimeter wavelengths can detect Planet Nine if it is the size of Neptune, has an effective temperature of 40 K, and is 700 au from the Sun. It would appear as a ∼30 mJy source at 1 mm with an annual parallax of ∼5 arcmin. The challenge is to distinguish it from the approximately 4000 foreground asteroids brighter than 30 mJy. Fortunately, these asteroids are known to the Minor Planet Center and can be identified because they move across a resolution element in a matter of hours, orders of magnitude faster than Planet Nine. If Planet Nine is smaller, colder, and/or more distant than expected, then it could be as faint as 1 mJy at 1 mm. There are roughly 10(6) asteroids this bright and many are unknown, making current cosmology experiments confusion limited for moving sources. Nonetheless, it may still be possible to find the proverbial needle in the haystack using a matched filter. This would require millimeter telescopes with high angular resolution and high sensitivity in order to alleviate confusion and to enable the identification of moving sources with relatively short time baselines. Regardless of its millimeter flux density, searching for Planet Nine would require frequent radio measurements for large swaths of the sky, including the ecliptic and Galactic plane. Even if Planet Nine had already been detected by other means, measuring its millimeter flux would constrain its internal energy budget, and therefore help resolve the mystery of Uranus and Neptune, which have vastly different internal heat.",0

Destabilizing nature of transient trajectories is discussed and its connection with the eigenvalue-based linearization procedure.

We calculate exact abundances of typical and extreme transient trajectories finding both Gaussian and Tracy-Widom distributions known in extreme value statistics. We identify degrees of freedom driving transient behavior as connected to the eigenvectors and encoded in a nonorthogonality matrix T0. We accordingly extend the May-Wigner model to contain a phase with typical transient trajectories present. An exact norm of the trajectory is obtained in the vanishing T0 limit where it describes a normal matrix.",0
57430,1,"Cumulants, Spreadability and the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff Series We define spreadability systems as a generalization of exchangeability systems in order to unify various notions of independence and cumulants known in noncommutative probability. In particular, our theory covers monotone independence and monotone cumulants which do not satisfy exchangeability. To this end we study generalized zeta and M\""obius functions in the context of the incidence algebra of the semilattice of ordered set partitions and prove an appropriate variant of Faa di Bruno's theorem. With the aid of this machinery we show that our cumulants cover most of the previously known cumulants. Due to noncommutativity of independence the behaviour of these cumulants with respect to independent random variables is more complicated than in the exchangeable case and the appearance of Goldberg coefficients exhibits the role of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff series in this context. In a final section we exhibit an interpretation of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff series as a sum of cumulants in a particular spreadability system, thus providing a new derivation of the Goldberg coefficients.",0
57437,1,"Forming disk galaxies in wet major mergers. I. Three fiducial examples Using three fiducial N-body+SPH simulations, we follow the merging of two disk galaxies that each have a hot gaseous halo component, and examine whether the merger remnant can be a spiral galaxy. The stellar progenitor disks are destroyed by violent relaxation during the merging and most of their stars form a classical bulge, while the remaining stars, as well as stars born during the merging times, form a thick disk and its bar. A new stellar disk forms subsequently and gradually in the remnant from the gas accreted mainly from the halo. It is vertically thin and well extended in its equatorial plane. A bar starts forming before the disk is fully in place, which is contrary to what is assumed in idealized simulations of isolated bar-forming galaxies, and has morphological features such as ansae and boxy/peanut bulges. Stars of different ages populate different parts of the box/peanut. A disky pseudobulge also forms, so that by the end of the simulation all three types of bulges coexist. The oldest stars are found in the classical bulge, followed by those of the thick disk, then by those in the thin disk. The youngest stars are in the spiral arms and the disky pseudobulge. The disk surface density profiles are of type II (exponential with downbending), the circular velocity curves are flat and show that the disks are submaximum in these examples: two clearly so and one near-borderline between maximum and submaximum. On average, only roughly between 10% and 20% of the stellar mass is in the classical bulge of the final models, i.e., much less than in previous simulations.",0
57445,1,"Thermal stability of interface voids in Cu grain boundaries with molecular dynamic simulations By means of molecular dynamic simulations, the stability of cylindrical voids is examined with respect to the diffusion bonding procedure. To do this, the effect of grain boundaries between the grains of different crystallographic orientations on the void closing time was studied at high temperatures from 0.7 up to 0.94 of the bulk melting temperature $(T_m)$. The diameter of the voids varied from 3.5 to 6.5 nm. A thermal instability occurring at high temperatures at the surface of the void placed in a grain boundary triggered the eventual closure of the void at all examined temperatures. The closing time has an exponential dependence on the examined temperature values. A model based on the defect diffusion theory is developed to predict the closing time for voids of macroscopic size. The diffusion coefficient within the grain boundaries is found to be overall higher than the diffusion coefficient in the region around the void surface. The activation energy for the diffusion in the grain boundary is calculated based on molecular dynamic simulations. This value agrees well with the experimental given in the Ashby maps for the creep in copper via Coble GB diffusion.",0

57675,1,"Star cluster formation in cosmological simulations. I. Properties of young clusters We present a new implementation of star formation in cosmological simulations, by considering star clusters as a unit of star formation. Cluster particles grow in mass over several million years at the rate determined by local gas properties, with high time resolution. The particle growth is terminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on the interstellar medium. We test this implementation for Milky Way-sized galaxies at high redshift, by comparing the properties of model clusters with observations of young star clusters. We find that the cluster initial mass function is best described by a Schechter function rather than a single power law. In agreement with observations, at low masses the logarithmic slope is $\alpha\approx 1.8-2$, while the cutoff at high mass scales with the star formation rate. A related trend is a positive correlation between the surface density of star formation rate and fraction of stars contained in massive clusters. Both trends indicate that the formation of massive star clusters is preferred during bursts of star formation. These bursts are often associated with major merger events. We also find that the median timescale for cluster formation ranges from 0.5 to 4 Myr and decreases systematically with increasing star formation efficiency. Local variations in the gas density and cluster accretion rate naturally lead to the scatter of the overall formation efficiency by an order of magnitude, even when the instantaneous efficiency is kept constant. Comparison of the formation timescale with the observed age spread of young star clusters provides an additional important constraint on the modeling of star formation and feedback schemes.",0

Most potential physical realizations of such membranes have a bending stiffness well in excess of experimentally achievable temperatures and are therefore unlikely ever to access the crumpling regime. We propose a mechanism to tune the onset of the crumpling transition by altering the geometry and topology of the sheet itself. We carry out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of perforated sheets with a dense periodic array of holes and observe that the critical temperature is controlled by the total fraction of removed area, independent of the precise arrangement and size of the individual holes. The critical exponents for the perforated membrane are compatible with those of the standard crumpling transition.",0
58097,1,"Adaptive prior probabilities via optimization of risk and entropy An agent choosing between various actions tends to take the one with the lowest loss. But this choice is arguably too rigid (not adaptive) to be useful in complex situations, e.g. where exploration-exploitation trade-off is relevant, or in creative task solving. Here we study an agent that -- given a certain average utility invested into adaptation -- chooses his actions via probabilities obtained through optimizing the entropy. As we argue, entropy minimization corresponds to a risk-averse agent, whereas a risk-seeking agent will maximize the entropy. The entropy minimization can (under certain conditions) recover the epsilon-greedy probabilities known in reinforced learning. We show that the entropy minimization -- in contrast to its maximization -- leads to rudimentary forms of intelligent behavior: (i) the agent accounts for extreme events, especially when he did not invest much into adaptation. (ii) He chooses the action related to lesser loss (lesser of two evils) when confronted with two actions with comparable losses. (iii) The agent is subject to effects similar to cognitive dissonance and frustration. Neither of these features are shown by the risk-seeking agent whose probabilities are given by the maximum entropy. Mathematically, the difference between entropy maximization versus its minimization corresponds with maximizing a convex function (in a convex domain, i.e.convex programming) versus minimizing it (concave programming).",0
58255,1,"Label-free optical detection of single enzyme-reactant reactions and associated conformational changes Monitoring the kinetics and conformational dynamics of single enzymes is crucial in order to better understand their biological functions as these motions and structural dynamics are usually unsynchronized among the molecules. Detecting the enzyme-reactant interactions and associated conformational changes of the enzyme on a single molecule basis, however, remain as a challenge with established optical techniques due to the commonly required labeling of the reactants or the enzyme itself. The labeling process is usually non-trivial and the labels themselves might skew the physical properties of the enzyme. Here we demonstrate an optical, label-free method capable of observing enzymatic interactions and the associated conformational changes on the single molecule level. We monitor polymerase/DNA interactions via the strong near-field enhancement provided by plasmonic nanorods resonantly coupled to whispering gallery modes in microcavities. Specifically, we employ two different recognition schemes: one in which the kinetics of polymerase/DNA interactions are probed in the vicinity of DNA-functionalized nanorods, and the other in which these interactions are probed via the magnitude of conformational changes in the polymerase molecules immobilized on nanorods. In both approaches we find that low and high polymerase activities can be clearly discerned via their characteristic signal amplitude and signal length distributions. Furthermore, the thermodynamic study of the monitored interactions suggests the occurrence of DNA polymerization. This work constitutes a proof-of-concept study of enzymatic activities via plasmonically enhanced microcavities and establishes an alternative and label-free method capable of investigating structural changes in single molecules.",0

58282,1,"Ionisation and discharge in cloud-forming atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets Brown dwarfs and giant gas extrasolar planets have cold atmospheres with a rich chemical compositions from which mineral cloud particles form. Their properties, like particle sizes and material composition, vary with height, and the mineral cloud particles are charged due to triboelectric processes in such dynamic atmospheres. The dynamics of the atmospheric gas is driven by the irradiating host star and/or by the rotation of the objects that changes during its lifetime. Thermal gas ionisation in these ultra-cool but dense atmospheres allows electrostatic interactions and magnetic coupling of a substantial atmosphere volume. Combined with a strong magnetic field $\gg B_{\rm Earth}$, a chromosphere and aurorae might form as suggested by radio and X-ray observations of brown dwarfs. Non-equilibrium processes like cosmic ray ionisation and discharge processes in clouds will increase the local pool of free electrons in the gas. Cosmic rays and lighting discharges also alter the composition of the local atmospheric gas such that tracer molecules might be identified. Cosmic rays affect the atmosphere through air showers which was modelled with a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to be able to visualise their spacial extent. Given a certain degree of thermal ionisation of the atmospheric gas, we suggest that electron attachment to charge mineral cloud particles is too inefficient to cause an electrostatic disruption of the cloud particles. Cloud particles will therefore not be destroyed by Coulomb explosion for the local temperature in the collisional dominated brown dwarf and giant gas planet atmospheres. However, the cloud particles are destroyed electrostatically in regions with strong gas ionisation. The potential size of such cloud holes would, however, be too small and might occur too far inside the cloud to mimic the effect of, e.g., magnetic field induced star spots.",0
58360,1,"A Versatile Setup for Ultrafast Broadband Optical Spectroscopy of Coherent Collective Modes in Strongly Correlated Quantum Systems A femtosecond pump-probe setup is described that is optimised for broadband transient reflectivity experiments on solid samples over a wide range of temperatures. By combining a temporal resolution of 45 fs and a broad detection range between 1.75 and 2.85 eV, this apparatus can provide insightful information on the interplay between coherent collective modes and high-energy electronic excitations, which is one of the distinctive characteristics of strongly interacting and correlated quantum systems. The use of a single-shot readout CMOS array detector at frame rates up to 10 kHz allows to resolve coherent oscillations with amplitudes below 10$^{-4}$ in $\Delta$R/R.

58548,1,"Magnetic Skyrmions and Skyrmion Clusters in the Helical Phase of Cu2OSeO3 Skyrmions are nanometric spin whirls that can be stabilized in magnets lacking inversion symmetry. The properties of isolated Skyrmions embedded in a ferromagnetic background have been intensively studied. We show that single Skyrmions and clusters of Skyrmions can also form in the helical phase and investigate theoretically their energetics and dynamics. The helical background provides natural one-dimensional channels along which a Skyrmion can move rapidly. In contrast to Skyrmions in ferromagnets, the Skyrmion-Skyrmion interaction has a strong attractive component and thus Skyrmions tend to form clusters with characteristic shapes. These clusters are directly observed in transmission electron microscopy measurements in thin films of Cu2OSeO3. Topological quantization, high mobility, and the confinement of Skyrmions in channels provided by the helical background may be useful for future spintronics devices.",0
58663,1,"Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and vortex-antivortex lattice melting in two-dimensional Fermi gases with $p$- or $d$-wave pairing We present a theoretical study of the finite-temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) and vortex-antivortex lattice (VAL) melting transitions in two-dimensional Fermi gases with p- or d-wave pairing. For both pairings, when the interaction is tuned from weak to strong attractions, we observe a quantum phase transition from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity to the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of difermions. The KT and VAL transition temperatures increase during this BCS-BEC transition and approach constant values in the deep BEC region. The BCS-BEC transition is characterized by the nonanalyticities of the chemical potential, the superfluid order parameter, and the sound velocities as functions of the interaction strength at both zero and finite temperatures; however, the temperature effect tends to weaken the nonanalyticities compared to the zero-temperature case. The effect of mismatched Fermi surfaces on the d-wave pairing is also studied.",0

However, in TaAs it has proven challenging to study the rich transport phenomena arising from emergent Weyl fermions. The series Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ are inversion-breaking, layered, tunable semimetals already under study as a promising platform for new electronics and recently proposed to host Type II, or strongly Lorentz-violating, Weyl fermions. Here we report the discovery of a Weyl semimetal in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ at $x = 25\%$. We use pump-probe angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (pump-probe ARPES) to directly observe a topological Fermi arc above the Fermi level, demonstrating a Weyl semimetal. The excellent agreement with calculation suggests that Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ is the first Type II Weyl semimetal.

59057,1,"Mapping and discrimination of networks in the complexity-entropy plane Complex networks are usually characterized in terms of their topological, spatial, or information-theoretic properties and combinations of the associated metrics are used to discriminate networks into different classes or categories. However, even with the present variety of characteristics at hand it still remains a subject of current research to appropriately quantify a network's complexity and correspondingly discriminate between different types of complex networks, like infrastructure or social networks, on such a basis. Here we explore the possibility to classify complex networks by means of a statistical complexity measure that has formerly been successfully applied to distinguish different types of chaotic and stochastic time series. It is composed of a network's averaged per-node entropic measure characterizing the network's information content and the associated Jenson-Shannon divergence as a measure of disequilibrium. We study 29 real-world networks and show that networks of the same category tend to cluster in distinct areas of the resulting complexity-entropy plane. We demonstrate that within our framework, connectome networks exhibit among the highest complexity while, e.g., transportation and infrastructure networks display significantly lower values. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to families of random scale-free and Watts-Strogatz model networks. We then show in a second application that the proposed framework is useful to objectively construct threshold-based networks, such as functional climate networks or recurrence networks, by choosing the threshold such that the statistical network complexity is maximized.",0

59129,1,"Could the physical world be emergent instead of fundamental, and why should we ask? (short version) In physics, there is the prevailing intuition that we are part of a unique external world, and that the goal of physics is to understand and describe this world. This assumption of the fundamentality of objective reality is often seen as a major prerequisite of any kind of scientific reasoning. However, here I argue that we should consider relaxing this assumption in a specific way in some contexts. Namely, there is a collection of open questions in and around physics that can arguably be addressed in a substantially more consistent and rigorous way if we consider the possibility that the first-person perspective is ultimately more fundamental than our usual notion of external world. These are questions like: which probabilities should an observer assign to future experiences if she is told that she will be simulated on a computer? How should we think of cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, and what can we learn from the fact that measurements in quantum theory seem to do more than just reveal preexisting properties? Why are there simple computable laws of physics in the first place? This note summarizes a longer companion paper which constructs a mathematically rigorous theory along those lines, suggesting a simple and unified framework (rooted in algorithmic information theory) to address questions like those above. It is not meant as a ""theory of everything"" (in fact, it predicts its own limitations), but it shows how a notion of objective external world, looking very much like our own, can provably emerge from a starting point in which the first-person perspective is primary, without apriori assumptions on the existence of ""laws"" or a ""physical world"". While the ideas here are perfectly compatible with physics as we know it, they imply some quite surprising predictions and suggest that we may want to substantially revise the way we think about some foundational questions.",0

59324,1,"Building an Inclusive AAS - The Critical Role of Diversity and Inclusion Training for AAS Council and Astronomy Leadership Diversity, equity and inclusion are the science leadership issues of our time. As our nation and the field of astronomy grow more diverse, we find ourselves in a position of enormous potential and opportunity: a multitude of studies show how groups of diverse individuals with differing viewpoints outperform homogenous groups to find solutions that are more innovative, creative, and responsive to complex problems, and promote higher-order thinking amongst the group. Research specifically into publications also shows that diverse author groups publish in higher quality journals and receive higher citation rates. As we welcome more diverse individuals into astronomy, we therefore find ourselves in a position of potential never before seen in the history of science, with the best minds and most diverse perspectives our field has ever seen. Despite this enormous growing potential, and the proven power of diversity, the demographics of our field are not keeping pace with the changing demographics of the nation, and astronomers of colour, women, LGBT individuals, people with disabilities, and those with more than one of these identities still face ""chilly"" or ""hostile"" work environments in the sciences. If we are to fully support all astronomers and students in reaching their full scientific potential, we must recognize that most of us tend to overestimate our ability to support our minoritized students and colleagues, that our formal education system fails to prepare us for working in a multicultural environment, and that most of us need some kind of training to help us know what we don't know and fill those gaps in our education.

59387,1,Relaxation Process of Interacting Two-mode System Influenced by Markovian Thermal Reservoirs Two different models of a relaxation process are considered for a linearly interacting two-mode system under the influence of independent Markovian thermal reservoirs. One is to describe the relaxation process of bare particles and the other is to describe the one of quasi particles which are derived from bare particles by the Bogoliubov transformation. The difference is that the former does not includes the effect of the inter-mode interaction on the damping operator while the latter does. The equations of motion are solved algebraically by making use of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics. The relaxation processes in the two models are investigated in detail. The results are applied for investigating a non-ideal beam splitter with photon loss and noise addition.,0
59710,1,"A Classification of Clifford Algebras as Images of Group Algebras of Salingaros Vee Groups The main objective of this work is to prove that every Clifford algebra $C \ell _{p,q}$ is $\mathbb {R}$ -isomorphic to a quotient of a group algebra $\mathbb {R}[G_{p,q}]$ modulo an ideal $\mathcal {J}=(1+\tau )$ where $\tau $ is a central element of order 2.

Thus, Clifford algebras $C \ell _{p,q}$ can be classified by Salingaros classes. Since the group algebras $\mathbb {R}[G_{p,q}]$ are $\mathbb {Z}_2$ -graded and the ideal $\mathcal {J}$ is homogeneous, the quotient algebras $\mathbb {R}[G]/\mathcal {J}$ are $\mathbb {Z}_2$ -graded. In some instances, the isomorphism $\mathbb {R}[G]/\mathcal {J}\cong C \ell _{p,q}$ is also $\mathbb {Z}_2$ -graded. By Salingaros’ Theorem, the groups $G_{p,q}$ in the class $N_{2k-1}$ are iterative central products of k copies of the dihedral group $D_8$ while the groups in the class $N_{2k}$ are iterative central products of $k-1$ copies of the dihedral group $D_8$ and one copy of the quaternion group $Q_8$ , and so they are extra-special.

However, it is a formidable task (not yet solved, except possibly for the ground and a few lowest-lying energetic states) even for the small bunch of elementary quantum potentials which are used to approximate the mean-field potential of the physical systems. Recently, the dominant term of the Heisenberg and R\'enyi measures of the multidimensional harmonic system (i.e., a particle moving under the action of a $D$-dimensional quadratic potential, $D &gt; 1$) has been analytically calculated in the high-energy (i.e., Rydberg) and the high-dimensional (i.e., pseudoclassical) limits.

59858,1,"A doubly stochastic advection-diffusion-decay model for testing data assimilation methodologies A doubly stochastic advection-diffusion-decay model defined on the 1D spatial domain (the circle) is proposed. The model is intended to be used in testing and developing data assimilation methodologies as well as in a broader context of non-stationary spatio-temporal random field modeling. The model is hierarchical: it is a stochastic (forced by the white noise) partial differential equation whose coefficients are spatio-temporal random fields by themselves satisfying their own stochastic partial differential equations with constant coefficients. The solution to the model is a random field that has complex spatio-temporal covariances with the tunable degree of non-stationarity. Another important feature of the model is that it allows the estimation of ""true"" space and time specific spatio-temporal covariances: both signal covariances and error covariances for any filter in question. This provides the researcher not only with the true state, as in the Observing Systems Simulation Experiments (OSSE) methodology, but also with the true error ""covariances of the day"". The capabilities of the doubly stochastic model are illustrated in numerical experiments with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). It is shown that the accuracy of the forecast-ensemble sample covariance matrix can be substantially improved by its temporal smoothing.",0

On complex quaternionic manifolds, which are essentially the complexification of real analytic quaternionic K\""ahler manifolds, the existence of these complexes was established by Baston by using twistor transformations and spectral sequences. Unimodular quaternionic manifolds constitute a nice and large class of quaternionic manifolds: the conformal change of a unimodular quaternionic structure is still unimodular quaternionic and the complexes over such manifolds are conformally invariant. This class of manifolds, including quaternionic K\""ahler manifolds, are the real version of torsion-free QCFs introduced by Bailey and Eastwood.

We also obtain a Weitzenb\""ock formula to establish vanishing of the cohomology groups of these complexes for quaternionic K\""ahler manifolds with negative scalar curvatures.",0
59881,1,"New class of flat-band models on tetragonal and hexagonal lattices: Gapped versus crossing flat bands We propose a new class of tight-binding models where a flat band exists either gapped from or crossing right through a dispersive band on two-band (i.e., two sites/unit cell) tetragonal and honeycomb lattices. By imposing a condition on the hopping parameters for generic models with up to third-neighbor hoppings, we first obtain models having a rigorously flat band isolated from a dispersive band with a gap, which accommodate both rank reducing and non-rank reducing of the Hamiltonian. The models include Tasaki's flat-band models, but the present model generally has a nonzero flat-band energy whose gap from the dispersive band is controllable as well. We then modify the models by appropriately changing the second- or third-neighbor hoppings, leading to a new class of two-dimensional lattices where a (slightly warped) flat band pierces a dispersive one. As with the known flat-band models, the connectivity condition is satisfied in the present models, so that we have unusual, unorthogonalizable Wannier orbitals. We have also shown that the present flat-band model can be extended to three (or higher) dimensions. Implications on possible high-TC superconductivity are discussed when a repulsive electron-electron interaction is introduced, where the flat band is envisaged to be utilized as intermediate states in pair scattering processes.",0
59966,1,"Discovering Extrasolar Planets with Microlensing Surveys An astronomical survey is commonly understood as a mapping of a large region of the sky, either photometrically (possibly in various filters/wavelength ranges) or spectroscopically. Often, catalogs of objects are produced/provided as the main product or a by-product. However, with the advent of large CCD cameras and dedicated telescopes with wide-field imaging capabilities, it became possible in the early 1990s, to map the same region of the sky over and over again. In principle, such data sets could be combined to get very deep stacked images of the regions of interest. However, I will report on a completely different use of such repeated maps: Exploring the time domain for particular kinds of stellar variability, namely microlens-induced magnifications in search of exoplanets. Such a time-domain microlensing survey was originally proposed by Bohdan Paczynski in 1986 in order to search for dark matterobjects in the Galactic halo. Only a few years later three teams started this endeavour. I will report on the history and current state of gravitational microlensing surveys. By now, routinely 100 million stars in the Galactic Bulge are monitored a few times per week by so-called survey teams. All stars with constant apparent brightness and those following known variability patterns are filtered out in order to detect the roughly 2000 microlensing events per year which are produced by stellar lenses. These microlensing events are identified &ldquo;online&rdquo; while still in their early phases and then monitored with much higher cadence by so-called follow-up teams. The most interesting of such events are those produced by a star-plus-planet lens. By now of order 30 exoplanets have been discovered by these combined microlensing surveys. Microlensing searches for extrasolar planets are complementary to other exoplanet search techniques. There are two particular advantages: The microlensing method is sensitive down to Earth-mass planets even with ground-based telecopes, and it can be easily used to determine the global abundance of planets in the Milky Way. Recent results of these microlensing surveys are presented and discussed, e. g. the discovery that on average every Milky Way star has at least one planet of Neptune mass or higher.",0

60703,1,"Assessment of Systematic Chromatic Errors that Impact Sub-1% Photometric Precision in Large-Area Sky Surveys Meeting the science goals for many current and future ground-based optical large-area sky surveys requires that the calibrated broadband photometry is stable in time and uniform over the sky to 1% precision or better. Past surveys have achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar photometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in multiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only consider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal plane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the source color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the atmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source color-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be considered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper, we examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES and calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric transmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system. We conclude that the systematic chromatic errors caused by the change of airmass in each exposure, the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the atmosphere over time, and the non-uniformity of instrumental throughput over the focal plane, can be up to 2% in some bandpasses. We compare the calculated systematic chromatic errors with the observed DES data. For the test sample data, we correct these errors using measurements of the atmospheric transmission and instrumental throughput. The residual after correction is less than 0.3%. We also find that the errors for non-stellar objects are redshift-dependent and can be larger than those for stars at certain redshifts.",0
60809,1,"Transverse noncommutative geometry of foliations We define an $L^2$-signature for proper actions on spaces of leaves of transversely oriented foliations with bounded geometry.

The Connes-Moscovici hypoelliptic signature operator yields an example of such a triple and gives the differential definition of our ""$L^2$-signature"". For Galois coverings of bounded geometry foliations, we also define an Atiyah-Connes semi-finite spectral triple which generalizes to Riemannian bifoliations the Atiyah approach to the $L^2$-index theorem.

61242,1,"On 2-representation infinite algebras arising from dimer models The Jacobian algebra arising from a consistent dimer model gives a non-commutative crepant resolution of a $3$-dimensional Gorenstein toric singularity, which is a non-commutative analogue of the usual crepant resolution.

It is known that if the degree zero part of such an algebra is finite dimensional, then it is a $2$-representation infinite algebra which is a generalization of a representation infinite hereditary algebra. In this paper, we show that internal perfect matchings which correspond to toric exceptional divisors on a crepant resolution of a $3$-dimensional Gorenstein toric singularity characterize the property that the degree zero part of the Jacobian algebra is finite dimensional. Moreover, combining this result with the theorems due to Amiot-Iyama-Reiten, we show that the stable category of graded maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules admits a tilting object for any $3$-dimensional Gorenstein toric isolated singularity.

Although the amount of data available to us is constantly increasing, our ability to process it becomes more and more difficult. Efficient discovery of useful knowledge from these datasets is therefore becoming a challenge and a massive economic need. This led to the need of developing large-scale data mining (DM) techniques to deal with these huge datasets either from science or economic applications. In this chapter, we present a new DDM system combining dataset-driven and architecture-driven strategies. Data-driven strategies will consider the size and heterogeneity of the data, while architecture driven will focus on the distribution of the datasets. This system is based on a Grid middleware tools that integrate appropriate large data manipulation operations. Therefore, this allows more dynamicity and autonomicity during the mining, integrating and processing phases",0

61308,1,"Upsets in Erased Floating Gate Cells With High-Energy Protons We discuss upsets in erased floating gate cells, due to large threshold voltage shifts, using statistical distributions collected on a large number of memory cells. The spread in the neutral threshold voltage appears to be too low to quantitatively explain the experimental observations in terms of simple charge loss, at least in SLC devices. The possibility that memories exposed to high energy protons and heavy ions exhibit negative charge transfer between programmed and erased cells is investigated, although the analysis does not provide conclusive support to this hypothesis.",0
61309,1,"Diminish Electrostatic in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy through longer ultra-stiff tips Piezoresponse Force Microscopy is a powerful but delicate nanoscale technique that measures the mechanical response resulting from the application of a highly localized electric field. Though mechanical response is normally due to piezoelectricity, other physical phenomena, especially electrostatic interaction, can contribute to the signal read. We address this problematic through the use of longer ultra-stiff probes providing state of the art sensitivity, with the lowest electrostatic interaction and avoiding working in high frequency regime. In order to find this solution we develop a theoretical description addressing the effects of electrostatic contributions in the total cantilever vibration and its quantification for different setups. The theory is subsequently tested in a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystal, a sample with well-defined 0deg and 180deg domains, using different commercial available conductive tips. We employ the theoretical description to compare the electrostatic contribution effects into the total phase recorded. Through experimental data our description is corroborated for each of the tested commercially available probes. We propose that a larger probe length can be a solution to avoid electrostatic forces, so the cantilever-sample electrostatic interaction is reduced. For hard oxide samples we propose an ultra-stiff cantilever which avoids the use of high frequency voltage but still diminishing electrostatic forces. Our proposed commercially available solution have great implications into avoiding artifacts while studying soft biological samples, multiferroic oxides, and thin film ferroelectric materials and it opens a new window into tip engineering.",0

The stars of one young cluster (Ruprecht 7) demonstrate significant barium overabundance(~0.55 dex) that can not be due to the determination error. We have considered the Ba abundance determination errors due to LTE approach, saturation of the lines, synthetic and observed barium line fitting, and the causes of the Ba overabundance associated with the Galactic disc enrichment or the origin of open clusters. Possible explanation for this overabundance can be the origin of n-capture elements enrichment of the clusters (galactic or extragalactic) or additional sources of the Ba production.",0
61511,1,"Locality Bound for Dissipative Quantum Transport We prove an upper bound on the diffusivity of a general local and translation invariant quantum Markovian spin system: $D \leq D_0 + \left(\alpha \, v_\text{LR} \tau + \beta \, \xi \right) v_\text{C}$. Here $v_\text{LR}$ is the Lieb-Robinson velocity, $ v_\text{C}$ is a velocity defined by the current operator, $\tau$ is the decoherence time, $\xi$ is the range of interactions, $D_0$ is a microscopically determined diffusivity and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are precisely defined dimensionless coefficients. The bound constrains quantum transport by quantities that can either be obtained from the microscopic interactions ($D_0, v_\text{LR}, v_\text{C},\xi$) or else determined from independent local non-transport measurements ($\tau,\alpha,\beta$). We illustrate the general result with the case of a spin half XXZ chain with on-site dephasing. Our result generalizes the Lieb-Robinson bound to constrain the sub-ballistic diffusion of conserved densities in a dissipative setting.",0

In this paper, using entropy-based measures, we investigate the relationships between quantum correlated coherence, which is the coherence between subsystems, and two main kinds of quantum correlations as defined by quantum discord as well as quantum entanglement. In particular, we show that quantum discord and quantum entanglement can be well characterized by quantum correlated coherence. Moreover, we prove that the entanglement measure formulated by quantum correlated coherence is lower and upper bounded by the relative entropy of entanglement and the entanglement of formation, respectively, and equal to the relative entropy of entanglement for all the maximally correlated states.",0
61614,1,"Unidirectional, dual-comb lasing under multiple pulse formation mechanisms in a passively mode-locked fiber ring laser Dual-comb lasers from which asynchronous ultrashort pulses can be simultaneously generated have recently become an interesting research subject. They could be an intriguing alternative to the current dual-laser optical-frequency-comb source with highly sophisticated electronic control systems. If generated through a common light path traveled by all pulses, the common-mode noises between the spectral lines of different pulse trains could be significantly reduced. Therefore, coherent dual-comb generation from a completely common-path, unidirectional lasing cavity would be an interesting territory to explore. In this paper, we demonstrate such a dual-comb lasing scheme based on a nanomaterial saturable absorber with additional pulse narrowing and broadening mechanisms concurrently introduced into a mode-locked fiber laser. The interactions between multiple soliton formation mechanisms result in unusual bifurcation into two-pulse states with quite different characteristics. Simultaneous oscillation of pulses with four-fold difference in pulsewidths and tens of Hz repetition rate difference is observed. The coherence between these spectral-overlapped, picosecond and femtosecond pulses is further verified by the corresponding asynchronous cross-sampling and dual-comb spectroscopy measurements.",0
61616,1,"Room temperature 9 $\mu$m photodetectors and GHz heterodyne receivers Room temperature operation is mandatory for any optoelectronics technology which aims to provide low-cost compact systems for widespread applications. In recent years, an important technological effort in this direction has been made in bolometric detection for thermal imaging$^1$, which has delivered relatively high sensitivity and video rate performance ($\sim$ 60 Hz). However, room temperature operation is still beyond reach for semiconductor photodetectors in the 8-12 $\mu$m wavelength band$^2$, and all developments for applications such as imaging, environmental remote sensing and laser-based free-space communication$^{3-5}$ have therefore had to be realised at low temperatures. For these devices, high sensitivity and high speed have never been compatible with high temperature operation$^{6, 7}$. Here, we show that a 9 $\mu$m quantum well infrared photodetector$^8$, implemented in a metamaterial made of subwavelength metallic resonators$^{9-12}$, has strongly enhanced performances up to room temperature. This occurs because the photonic collection area is increased with respect to the electrical area for each resonator, thus significantly reducing the dark current of the device$^{13}$. Furthermore, we show that our photonic architecture overcomes intrinsic limitations of the material, such as the drop of the electronic drift velocity with temperature$^{14, 15}$, which constrains conventional geometries at cryogenic operation$^6$. Finally, the reduced physical area of the device and its increased responsivity allows us, for the first time, to take advantage of the intrinsic high frequency response of the quantum detector$^7$ at room temperature. By beating two quantum cascade lasers$^{16}$ we have measured the heterodyne signal at high frequencies up to 4 GHz.",0
61838,1,"Improved method for phase wraps reduction in profilometry In order to completely eliminate, or greatly reduce the number of phase wraps in 2D wrapped phase map, Gdeisat et al. proposed an algorithm, which uses shifting the spectrum towards the origin. But the spectrum can be shifted only by an integer number, meaning that the phase wraps reduction is often not optimal. In addition, Gdeisat's method will take much time to make the Fourier transform, inverse Fourier transform, select and shift the spectral components. In view of the above problems, we proposed an improved method for phase wraps elimination or reduction. First, the wrapped phase map is padded with zeros, the carrier frequency of the projected fringe is determined by high resolution, which can be used as the moving distance of the spectrum. And then realize frequency shift in spatial domain. So it not only can enable the spectrum to be shifted by a rational number when the carrier frequency is not an integer number, but also reduce the execution time. Finally, the experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is feasible.",0
61958,1,Canonical Universality Isolated quantum system in a pure state may be perceived as thermal if only substantially small fraction of all degrees of freedom is probed. We propose that in a chaotic quantum many-body system all states with sufficiently small energy fluctuations are approximately thermal. We refer to this hypothesis as Canonical Universality (CU). The CU hypothesis complements the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) which proposes that for chaotic systems individual energy eigenstates are thermal. Integrable and MBL systems do not satisfy CU. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence supporting the CU hypothesis.,0
61970,1,"Classical Limit and Quantum Logic The analysis of the classical limit of quantum mechanics usually focuses on the state of the system. The general idea is to explain the disappearance of the interference terms of quantum states appealing to the decoherence process induced by the environment. However, in these approaches it is not explained how the structure of quantum properties becomes classical. In this paper, we consider the classical limit from a different perspective. We consider the set of properties of a quantum system and we study the quantum-to-classical transition of its logical structure. The aim is to open the door to a new study based on dynamical logics, that is, logics that change over time. In particular, we appeal to the notion of hybrid logics to describe semiclassical systems. Moreover, we consider systems with many characteristic decoherence times, whose sublattices of properties become distributive at different times.",0

We utilize designer anvils with lithographically-deposited metallic microchannels on the diamond culet as a microwave antenna. We detected the spin resonance of an ensemble of microdiamonds under pressure, and measure the pressure dependence of the zero field splitting parameters.

In this article we determine all solutions to this ansatz that lead to a non-degenerate braiding. Particularly interesting are cases where the order of $q$ has common divisors with root lengths. In this way we produce familiar and unfamiliar series of (non-semisimple) modular tensor categories.

62399,1,"Predicting Solar Flares Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Data Product and Random Forest Algorithm Adverse space-weather effects can often be traced to solar flares, the prediction of which has drawn significant research interests. The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) produces full-disk vector magnetograms with continuous high cadence, while flare prediction efforts utilizing this unprecedented data source are still limited. Here we report results of flare prediction using physical parameters provided by the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and related data products. We survey X-ray flares that occurred from 2010 May to 2016 December and categorize their source regions into four classes (B, C, M, and X) according to the maximum GOES magnitude of flares they generated. We then retrieve SHARP-related parameters for each selected region at the beginning of its flare date to build a database. Finally, we train a machine-learning algorithm, called random forest (RF), to predict the occurrence of a certain class of flares in a given active region within 24 hr, evaluate the classifier performance using the 10-fold cross-validation scheme, and characterize the results using standard performance metrics. Compared to previous works, our experiments indicate that using the HMI parameters and RF is a valid method for flare forecasting with fairly reasonable prediction performance. To our knowledge, this is the first time that RF has been used to make multiclass predictions of solar flares. We also find that the total unsigned quantities of vertical current, current helicity, and flux near the polarity inversion line are among the most important parameters for classifying flaring regions into different classes.",0
62414,1,"Nonequilibrium thermodynamics with binary quantum correlations The balance equations for thermodynamic quantities are derived from the nonlocal quantum kinetic equation. The nonlocal collisions lead to molecular contributions to the observables and currents. The corresponding correlated parts of the observables are found to be given by the rate to form a molecule multiplied with its lifetime which can be considered as collision duration. Explicit expressions of these molecular contributions are given in terms of the scattering phase shifts. The two-particle form of the entropy is derived extending the Landau quasiparticle picture by two-particle molecular contributions. There is a continuous exchange of correlation and kinetic energies condensing into the rate of correlated variables for energy and momentum. For the entropy, an explicit gain remains and Boltzmann's H theorem is proved including the molecular parts of the entropy.",0
62520,1,"Rubber Relationalism: Smallest Graph-Theoretically Nontrivial Leibniz Spaces Kendall's Similarity Shape Theory for constellations of N points in the carrier space $\mathbb{R}^d$ as quotiented by the similarity group was developed for use in Probability and Statistics. It was subsequently shown to reside within Mechanics' Shape-and-Scale Theory, in which points are interpreted as particles, carrier space plays the role of absolute space, and the Euclidean group is quotiented out. Let us jointly refer to Shape(-and-Scale) Theory as Relational Theory, and to its reduced configuration spaces as relational spaces. We now consider a less structured version: the Topological Relational Theory of `rubber configurations'. This already encodes some features of the much more diverse Geometrical Relational Theories. In contrast with the latter's (stratified) manifold relational spaces, the former's are graphs: much simpler to treat; their edges encode topological adjacency. We concentrate on Leibniz spaces, corresponding to indistinguishable points and mirror-image identification. These are moreover the building blocks of the distinguishable and (where possible) mirror-image distinct cases' relational spaces. For connected manifold without boundary carrier spaces, there are just 3 'rubber relationalisms: $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{S}^1$, and a joint one for all carrier spaces with $d \geq 2$. For $d \geq 2$, rubber configurations are in 1:1 correspondence with partitions, with $\mathbb{S}^1$ and $\mathbb{R}$ giving successive refinements. We find that generic and maximal configurations are universally present as cone points, as are binaries in the first 2 cases. Deconing leaves us with residue graphs containing the N-specific information.

62665,1,"Helioseismic holography of simulated sunspots: magnetic and thermal contributions to travel times Wave propagation through sunspots involves conversion between waves of acoustic and magnetic character. In addition, the thermal structure of sunspots is very different than that of the quiet Sun. As a consequence, the interpretation of local helioseismic measurements of sunspots has long been a challenge. With the aim of understanding these measurements, we carry out numerical simulations of wave propagation through sunspots. Helioseismic holography measurements made from the resulting simulated wavefields show qualitative agreement with observations of real sunspots. We use additional numerical experiments to determine, separately, the influence of the thermal structure of the sunspot and the direct effect of the sunspot magnetic field. We use the ray approximation to show that the travel-time shifts in the thermal (non-magnetic) sunspot model are primarily produced by changes in the wave path due to the Wilson depression rather than variations in the wave speed. This shows that inversions for the subsurface structure of sunspots must account for local changes in the density. In some ranges of horizontal phase speed and frequency there is agreement (within the noise level in the simulations) between the travel times measured in the full magnetic sunspot model and the thermal model. If this conclusion proves to be robust for a wide range of models, it would suggest a path toward inversions for sunspot structure.",0

Interestingly, this model captures several essential properties of the metallic pseudogap phase in high-Tc cuprate superconductors. We identify a line in parameter space where the exact ground state wave functions can be constructed at an arbitrary density of fermionic dimers. At this exactly solvable line the ground state has a huge degeneracy, which can be interpreted as a flat band of fermionic excitations.

63753,1,"Scattering of gravity waves in subcritical flows over an obstacle We numerically study the scattering coefficients of linear water waves on stationary flows above a localized obstacle. We compare the scattering on trans- and subcritical flows, and then focus on the latter which have been used in recent analog gravity experiments. The main difference concerns the magnitude of the mode amplification: whereas transcritical flows display a large amplification (which is generally in good agreement with the Hawking prediction), this effect is heavily suppressed in subcritical flows. This is due to the transmission across the obstacle for frequencies less than some critical value. As a result, subcritical flows display high- and low-frequency behaviors separated by a narrow band around the critical frequency. In the low-frequency regime, transmission of long wavelengths is accompanied by nonadiabatic scattering into short wavelengths, whose spectrum is approximately linear in frequency. By contrast, in the high-frequency regime, no simple description seems to exist. In particular, for obstacles similar to those recently used, we observe that the upstream slope still affects the scattering on the downstream side because of some residual transmission.",0

HIMs combine the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling, thereby defining models via simulators of data with rich hidden structure. Next, we develop likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI), a scalable variational inference algorithm for HIMs. Key to LFVI is specifying a variational family that is also implicit.

Students reach beyond classroom walls to explore data with other students and experts and share results, publishing original work to a worldwide audience. Students can discover and extend the research of other students, modeling the processes of modern, large-scale research projects. From start to finish e-Labs are student-led, teacher-guided projects. Students need only a Web browser to access computing techniques employed by professional researchers. A Project Map with milestones allows students to set the research plan rather than follow a step-by-step process common in other online projects. Most importantly, e-Labs build the learning experience around the students' own questions and let them use the very tools that scientists use. Students contribute to and access shared data, most derived from professional research databases. They use common analysis tools, store their work and use metadata to discover, replicate and confirm the research of others. This is where real scientific collaboration begins. Using online tools, students correspond with other research groups, post comments and questions, prepare summary reports, and in general participate in the part of scientific research that is often left out of classroom experiments. Teaching tools such as student and teacher logbooks, pre- and post-tests and an assessment rubric aligned with learner outcomes help teachers guide student work.

64403,1,"$PT$ -symmetry-induced evolution of sharp asymmetric line shapes and high-sensitivity refractive index sensors in a three-cavity array It is important to control and tune the Fano-resonance spectra to achieve a large slope with, in addition, a relatively high extinction ratio for low-power optical switching and high-sensitivity sensing. Here, we explore the evolution of sharp asymmetric Fano-like line shapes in a three-cavity array with local parity-time (PT) symmetry. In this three-cavity configuration, a single cavity is coupled to a PT-symmetric combination of two cavities via a common waveguide. The influences of local PT symmetry on the asymmetric Fano-like line shapes are investigated by monitoring the output transmission spectra at various system parameters. It is found that both the slope and the extinction ratio within the sharp asymmetric line shapes can be significantly enhanced by introducing the PT-symmetric unit, compared with the configuration of two indirectly coupled cavities. Subsequently we discuss the application of such a PT-assisted configuration as a family of high-sensitivity refractive index sensors by numerical analysis. For practical parameters based on microring resonators, the best sensitivity of refractive index sensors is more than five orders of magnitude larger than two indirectly coupled lossy cavities. The proposed scheme can be implemented in current state-of-the-art experiments. This investigation can help us to understand the interplay between the Fano resonance and PT symmetry.",0
64453,1,"A model driven approach for assessing survivability requirements of critical infrastructures Critical infrastructures are complex networked systems. They must be able to provide essential services, even when they are compromised by intentional or accidental threats. Guaranteeing essential services means to ensure survivability with an adequate Quality of Service (QoS). This paper proposes a model-driven approach for the assessment of survivability requirements. In particular, we propose a graphical Survivability Assessment Model (SAM), based on UML. It is automatically derived from a UML specification that encompasses essential services, service modes, threats and survivability strategies. Furthermore, model-driven techniques are used to assess the SAM. Then, we propose some preliminary property verifications to discover flaws in the specification. The model driven paradigm is used to ensure high level of usability and abstraction of the artifacts that are key issues in communication among stakeholders. The approach has been applied to a scaled-down model of a smart grid, an evolution of traditional power grids based on high performance and dependable computer networks.",0

The dual Cohen forcing allows interpreting the real numbers in a model $M$ and its Cohen extension $M[G]$ as absolute subtrees of the binary tree (Cantor space). The trees are spanning non-trivial Casson handles of smooth exotic 4-manifolds, like $\mathbb{R}^4$. We formulate the consequences for the cosmological model with random forcing where dual smooth non-standard and non-flat Riemannian geometries have to appear.",0
64706,1,"Effect of texture on the structural and transport properties of Sb-doped Mg2Si thin films With the ever increasing energy demand, the need for miniaturized thermoelectric (TE) devices that minimize energy waste is becoming urgent. In this context, the use of thin film-based devices is a promising strategy provided that suitable materials with appropriate properties are developed. Here, for applications at temperatures ranging from 500 K to 850 K, the TE properties of the Mg2Si compound are investigated after its deposition as thin film by microwave plasma-assisted co-sputtering method. The effects of doping the Mg2Si films with different Sb contents and of the deposition temperature are assessed. Structural characterization shows that the films grown at room temperature exhibit a larger degree of texture and strains compared to those deposited at 463 K. Furthermore, the TE properties (electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity) are affected in a different way by the deposition temperature, resulting eventually in a higher power factor (based on in-plane characteristics) and higher thermal conductivity (measured out-of-plane) for RT depositions",0
64753,1,"Correlations in thermal vibrations of crystal atoms. Effect on dechanneling and bremsstrahlung In a crystal, thermal vibrations of neighboring atoms are correlated: long wavelength phonons make them displace in the same direction. These correlations can speed up the dechanneling of axially channeled particles, as shown by a simulation with binary collisions and a Markov chain model of atom vibrations. In the case of e+ or e- at small angle with a crystal axis, the correlated vibrations should give rise to a semi-coherent bremsstrahlung on several consecutive atoms of a row.",0
64767,1,"Ubiquity of Benford's law and emergence of the reciprocal distribution We apply the Law of Total Probability to the construction of scale-invariant probability distribution functions (pdf's), and require that probability measures be dimensionless and unitless under a continuous change of scales. If the scale-change distribution function is scale invariant then the constructed distribution will also be scale invariant. Repeated application of this construction on an arbitrary set of (normalizable) pdf's results again in scale-invariant distributions. The invariant function of this procedure is given uniquely by the reciprocal distribution, suggesting a kind of universality. We separately demonstrate that the reciprocal distribution results uniquely from requiring maximum entropy for size-class distributions with uniform bin sizes.",0
64784,1,"Abrupt disappearance and re-emergence of the SU(4) and SU(2) Kondo effects due to population inversion The interplay of almost degenerate levels in quantum dots and molecular junctions with possibly different couplings to the reservoirs has lead to many observable phenomena, such as the Fano effect, transmission phase slips, and the SU(4) Kondo effect. Here we predict a dramatic repeated disappearance and re-emergence of the SU(4) and anomalous SU(2) Kondo effects with increasing gate voltage. This phenomenon is attributed to the level occupation switching which has been previously invoked to explain the universal transmission phase slips in the conductance through a quantum dot. We use analytical arguments and numerical renormalization group calculations to explain the observations and discuss their experimental relevance and dependence on the physical parameters.",0
64901,1,"Dust-depletion sequences in damped Lyman-α absorbers - A unified picture from low-metallicity systems to the Galaxy We study metal depletion due to dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) to infer the properties of dust grains and characterize the metal and dust content of galaxies down to low metallicity and intermediate redshift z. We provide metal column densities and abundances of a sample of 70 damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) towards quasars, observed at high spectral resolution with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES). This is the largest sample of phosphorus abundances measured in DLAs so far. We use literature measurements for Galactic clouds to cover the high-metallicity end. We discover tight (scatter &#8818; 0.2 dex) correlations between [Zn/Fe] and the observed relative abundances from dust depletion. This implies that grain growth in the ISM is an important process of dust production. These sequences are continuous in [Zn/Fe] from dust-free to dusty DLAs, and to Galactic clouds, suggesting that the availability of refractory metals in the ISM is crucial for dust production, regardless of the star formation history. We observe [S/Zn] up to ~0.25 dex in DLAs, which is broadly consistent with Galactic stellar abundances. Furthermore, we find a good agreement between the nucleosynthetic pattern of Galactic halo stars and our observations of the least dusty DLAs. This supports recent star formation in low-metallicity DLAs. The derived depletions of Zn, O, P, S, Si, Mg, Mn, Cr, and Fe correlate with [Zn/Fe], with steeper slopes for more refractory elements. P is mostly not affected by dust depletion. We present canonical depletion patterns to be used as reference in future studies of relative abundances and depletion. We derive the total (dust-corrected) metallicity, typically -2 &#8818; [M/H] _tot &#8818; 0 for DLAs, and scattered around solar metallicity for the Galactic ISM. The dust-to-metal ratio ( [??] ) increases with metallicity, again supporting the importance of grain growth for dust production. The dust extinction A_V derived from the depletion is typically mag in DLAs. Finally, we derive elemental abundances in dust, which is key to understanding the dust composition and its evolution. We observe similar abundances of Mg, Si, and Fe in dust; this suggests that grain species such as pyroxenes and iron oxides are more important than olivine, but this needs to be confirmed by more detailed analysis. Overall, we characterize dust depletion, nucleosynthesis, and dust-corrected metallicity in DLAs, providing a unified picture from low-metallicity systems to the Galactic ISM.",0
65045,1,"Influence of water on the surface of graphene We have studied how water modifies the surface of graphene and in particular how the surface conductivity of graphene is affected. According to the literature, two types of interactions should be distinguished: physical, where a water molecule remains intact and is located at some distance from the mesh, and chemical, where a water molecule is imbricated in the graphene bond structure. We have developed theoretical models for both types of interactions using the density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP hybrid functional combined with the 6-31G(d) basis set. Our calculations show that the surface conductivity of graphene is reduced in the presence of water.",0

In this article, we define the doubling of these two spaces. We construct two bialgebra structures on these spaces which are in interaction, as well as two related associative products obtained by dualization.

65226,1,"How Logic Interacts with Geometry: Infinitesimal Curvature of Categorical Spaces In category theory, logic and geometry cooperate with each other producing what is known under the name Synthetic Differential Geometry (SDG). The main difference between SDG and standard differential geometry is that the intuitionistic logic of SDG enforces the existence of infinitesimal objects which essentially modify the local structure of spaces considered in SDG. We focus on an ""infinitesimal version"" of SDG, an infinitesimal $n$-dimensional formal manifold, and develop differential geometry on it. In particular, we show that the Riemann curvature tensor on infinitesimal level is itself infinitesimal. We construct a heuristic model $S^3 \times \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ and study it from two perspectives: the perspective of the category SET and that of the so-called topos $\mathcal{G}$ of germ-determined ideals. We show that the fact that in this model the curvature tensor is infinitesimal (in $\mathcal{G}$-perspective) eliminates the existing singularity. A surprising effect is that the hybrid geometry based on the existence of the infinitesimal and the SET levels generates an exotic smooth structure on $\mathbb{R}^4$. We briefly discuss the obtained results and indicate their possible applications.",0

To this end we have been investigating migrating services at the RAL Tier-1 to an Apache Mesos cluster. In this model the concept of individual machines is abstracted away and services are run in containers on a cluster of machines, managed by schedulers, enabling a high degree of automation.

65306,1,"The MASSIVE Survey - X. Stellar Velocity Features and Misalignment between Kinematic and Photometric Axes in Massive Early-Type Galaxies We use spatially resolved two-dimensional stellar velocity maps over a $107''\times 107''$ field of view to investigate the kinematic features of 90 early-type galaxies above stellar mass $10^{11.5}M_\odot$ in the MASSIVE survey. We measure the misalignment angle $\Psi$ between the kinematic and photometric axes and identify local features such as velocity twists and kinematically distinct components. We find 46% of the sample to be well aligned ($\Psi < 15^{\circ}$), 33% misaligned, and 21% without detectable rotation (non-rotators). Only 24% of the sample are fast rotators, the majority of which (91%) are aligned, whereas 57% of the slow rotators are misaligned with a nearly flat distribution of $\Psi$ from $15^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$. We find that 11 galaxies have $\Psi \gtrsim 60^{\circ}$ and thus exhibit minor-axis rotation (or ""prolate"" rotation) in which the rotation is preferentially around the photometric major axis. We find kinematic misalignment to occur more frequently for higher stellar mass, lower galaxy spin, lower ellipticity, or denser galaxy environments. In terms of local kinematic features, 51% of the sample exhibit kinematic twists of larger than $20^{\circ}$, and 2 galaxies have kinematically distinct components. The frequency of misalignment and the broad distribution of $\Psi$ reported here suggest that the most massive early-type galaxies are likely to be at least mildly triaxial, and the formation processes resulting in kinematically misaligned slow rotators such as gas-poor mergers occur frequently in this mass range.",0
65325,1,"Sensitive singular-phase optical detection without phase measurements with Tamm plasmons Spectrally-tailored interactions of light with material interfaces offer many exciting applications in sensing, photo-detection, and optical energy conversion. In particular, complete suppression of light reflectance at select frequencies accompanied by sharp phase variations in the reflected signal forms the basis for the development of ultra-sensitive singular-phase optical detection schemes such as Brewster and surface plasmon interferometry. However, both the Brewster effect and surface-plasmon-mediated absorption on planar interfaces are limited to one polarization of the incident light and oblique excitation angles, and may have limited bandwidth dictated by the material dielectric index and plasma frequency. To alleviate these limitations, we design narrow-band super-absorbers composed of plasmonic materials embedded into dielectric photonic nanostructures with topologically-protected interfacial Tamm plasmon states. These structures have planar geometry and do not require nanopatterning to achieve perfect absorption of both polarizations of the incident light in a wide range of incident angles, including the normal incidence. Their absorption lines are tunable across a very broad spectral range via engineering of the photon bandstructure of the dielectric photonic nanostructures to achieve reversal of the geometrical phase across the interface with the plasmonic absorber. We outline the design strategy to achieve perfect absorptance in Tamm structures with dissipative losses via conjugate impedance matching. We further demonstrate via modeling how these structures can be engineered to support sharp asymmetric amplitude resonances, which can be used to improve the sensitivity of optical sensors in the amplitude-only detection scheme that does not require use of bulky and expensive ellipsometry equipment.",0

Triangles in 2- and 3-d This is an innovative treatise on triangles, resting upon 1) 3-body problem techniques including mass-weighted relative Jacobi coordinates. 2) Part I's detailed layer-by-layer topological and geometrical study of Kendall-type shape spaces - configuration spaces of all possible shapes - which, for triangles, are (pieces of) spheres. 3) Hopf mathematics. Triangles are moreover prototypical through being the smallest models which carry relative-angle as well as length-ratio information. Both 1) and 3) produce insightful new versions of Heron's formula, 3)'s simultaneously providing new foundations for 2). Medians, and regular triangles bounding between tall and flat triangles, also play prominent roles. Right triangles form three kissing cap-circles on the shape sphere, from which a shape-theoretic answer to the well-known conundrum of what is the probability that a triangle is obtuse very readily follows: 3/4. The differential-geometric aspects of this answer moreover generalize to numerous variant problems. Hopf mathematics additionally gives a general bundle section interpretation to Kendall's iconic spherical blackboard of vertex-unlablelled mirror-image-identified triangles, and of its two variants where one of these two conditions are dropped. We attribute a monopole to each of these spaces and to the full shape sphere, one due to Dirac, one to Iwai and the other two are new to this paper. We finally make insightful comparison of triangles in 2-$d$ with a) Part II's 4 points on the line. b) Triangles in 3-$d$, which are particularly significant as the smallest model exhibiting stratification.

65765,1,"PAFit: an R Package for the Non-parametric Estimation of Preferential Attachment and Node Fitness in Temporal Complex Networks Many real-world systems are profitably described as complex networks that grow over time. Preferential attachment and node fitness are two simple growth mechanisms that not only explain certain structural properties commonly observed in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications in modeling and inference. While there are statistical packages for estimating various parametric forms of the preferential attachment function, there is no existing package for a non-parametric estimation, which would allow finer inspections on the famous `rich-get-richer' phenomenon as well as provide clues to explain non-standard structural properties observed in real-world networks. This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements statistical methods for estimating the preferential attachment function and node fitness non-parametrically, as well as a number of functions for generating complex networks from these two mechanisms. The main computational part of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure scalability to large-scale networks. In this paper, we first introduce the main functionalities of PAFit through simulated examples, and then use the package to analyze a collaboration network between scientists in the field of complex networks. The results indicate the joint existence of `rich-get-richer' and `fit-get-richer' phenomena in the collaboration network. The estimated attachment function is almost linear, which means that the probability an author develops a new collaboration is proportional to their current number of collaborators. Furthermore, the estimated fitnesses reveal many familiar names of the complex network field as top fittest scientists.",0
66054,1,"Spin analogs of superconductivity and integer quantum Hall effect in an array of spin chains Motivated by the successful idea of using weakly coupled quantum electronic wires to realize the quantum Hall effects and the quantum spin Hall effects, we theoretically study two systems composed of weakly coupled quantum spin chains within the mean-field approximations, which can exhibit spin analogs of superconductivity and the integer quantum Hall effect. First, a certain bilayer of two arrays of interacting spin chains is mapped, via the Jordan-Wigner transformation, to an attractive Hubbard model that exhibits fermionic superconductivity, which corresponds to spin superconductivity in the original spin Hamiltonian. Secondly, an array of spin-orbit-coupled spin chains in the presence of a suitable external magnetic field is transformed to an array of quantum wires that exhibits the integer quantum Hall effect, which translates into its spin analog in the spin Hamiltonian. The resultant spin superconductivity and spin integer quantum Hall effect can be characterized by their ability to transport spin without any resistance.",0

66398,1,"Instability analysis of cosmic viscoelastic gyro-gravitating clouds in the presence of dark matter A classical formalism for the weakly nonlinear instability analysis of a gravitating rotating viscoelastic gaseous cloud in the presence of gyratory dark matter is presented on the cosmic Jeans flat scales of space and time. The constituent neutral gaseous fluid (NGF) and dark matter fluid (DMF) are inter-coupled frictionally via mutual gravity alone. Application of standard nonlinear perturbation techniques over the complex gyro-gravitating clouds results in a unique conjugated pair of viscoelastic forced Burgers (VFB) equations. The VFB pair is conjointly twinned by correlational viscoelastic effects. There is no regular damping term here, unlike, in the conventional Burgers equation for the luminous (bright) matter solely. Instead, an interesting linear self-consistent derivative force-term naturalistically appears. A numerical illustrative platform is provided to reveal the micro-physical insights behind the weakly non-linear natural diffusive eigen-modes. It is fantastically seen that the perturbed NGF evolves as extended compressive solitons and compressive shock-like structures. In contrast, the perturbed DMF grows as rarefactive extended solitons and hybrid shocks. The latter is micro-physically composed of rarefactive solitons and compressive shocks. The consistency and reliability of the results are validated in the panoptic light of the existing reports based on the preeminent nonlinear advection-diffusion-based Burgers fabric.

66466,1,"Complete analysis of ensemble inequivalence in the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model We study inequivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles in the mean-field Blume-Emery-Griffiths model. This generalizes previous results obtained for the Blume-Capel model. The phase diagram strongly depends on the value of the biquadratic exchange interaction K, the additional feature present in the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model. At small values of K, as for the Blume-Capel model, lines of first- and second-order phase transitions between a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase are present, separated by a tricritical point whose location is different in the two ensembles. At higher values of K the phase diagram changes substantially, with the appearance of a triple point in the canonical ensemble, which does not find any correspondence in the microcanonical ensemble. Moreover, one of the first-order lines that starts from the triple point ends in a critical point, whose position in the phase diagram is different in the two ensembles. This line separates two paramagnetic phases characterized by a different value of the quadrupole moment. These features were not previously studied for other models and substantially enrich the landscape of ensemble inequivalence, identifying new aspects that had been discussed in a classification of phase transitions based on singularity theory. Finally, we discuss ergodicity breaking, which is highlighted by the presence of gaps in the accessible values of magnetization at low energies: it also displays new interesting patterns that are not present in the Blume-Capel model.",0
66588,1,"Topological monopoles and currents in electromagnetic waves Singularities, i.e. places of discontinuities of parameters are extremely general objects appearing in electromagnetic waves and thus are the key to understanding of fundamental wave processes. These structures commonly occur in purely coherent, highly directional waves, such as laser beams, determining additional spatial or topological properties of the wave fields independently of their propagational dynamics. For instance, topologies of wave fronts, called phase singularities, add orbital degrees of freedom to electromagnetic waves. These singularities are common to all types of scalar waves described only by their intensity and phase distributions. As the electromagnetic wave is a vector wave, its topological properties generally depend on all field components leading to complex field patterns in space and time. Some instantaneous field distributions may carry paradoxical vector topology when the originally source-free wave exhibits spatial structure associated with the ""virtual"" sources of electromagnetic fields localised in the vicinity of singular points. While the Maxwell equations involve only electric charges, an electromagnetic wave in free space is highly symmetrical with respect to the electric and magnetic fields as all real sources of the fields are absent. This places the topology of electric and magnetic fields on equal footing in the wave and gives rise to ""virtual"" sources of the both fields, named by us as wave monopoles. Here we present systematic description of topological singularities in both electric and magnetic field of the electromagnetic waves in a paraxial approximation. We also consider the important types of singular electromagnetic waves with field structure akin to that originating from sources of electric and magnetic fields.",0

The completion of a manifold with respect to a pseudo-Riemannian metric can be defined intrinsically, [SS94].

Our main purpose is to investigate the behavior of the overshoot and the small-scale dynamo with parameters as close as possible to those of the Sun. Our calculations show that the bottom part of the convection zone (CZ) becomes subadiabatic, which efficiently suppresses downflows. As a result, we see a steep transition from the CZ to the radiative zone, whose width is estimated to be 0.4% of the local pressure scale height. This result is consistent with a semianalytic convection/overshoot model. We also find that the small-scale dynamo becomes efficient with a smaller energy flux. The sudden suppression of the downflows around the base of the CZ increases the efficiency of the small-scale dynamo.",0
66934,1,"Unsupervised single-particle deep clustering via statistical manifold learning Motivation: Structural heterogeneity in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data represents a major challenge for high-resolution structure determination. Unsupervised classification may serve as the first step in the assessment of structural heterogeneity. Traditional algorithms for unsupervised classification, such as K-means clustering and maximum likelihood optimization, may classify images into wrong classes with decreasing signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the image data, yet demand increased cost in computation. Overcoming these limitations requires further development on clustering algorithms for high-performance cryo-EM data analysis. Results: Here we introduce a statistical manifold learning algorithm for unsupervised single-particle deep clustering. We show that statistical manifold learning improves classification accuracy by about 40% in the absence of input references for lower SNR data. Applications to several experimental datasets suggest that our deep clustering approach can detect subtle structural difference among classes. Through code optimization over the Intel high-performance computing (HPC) processors, our software implementation can generate thousands of reference-free class averages within several hours from hundreds of thousands of single-particle cryo-EM images, which allows significant improvement in ab initio 3D reconstruction resolution and quality. Our approach has been successfully applied in several structural determination projects. We expect that it provides a powerful computational tool in analyzing highly heterogeneous structural data and assisting in computational purification of single-particle datasets for high-resolution reconstruction.",0

The recently discovered first interstellar object 1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua) has brightness that varies by a factor of 10, a range greater than that of any Solar System asteroid, a spectrum characteristic of Type D asteroids, and no evidence of evaporating volatiles, contrary to expectation for exo-Oort clouds. This object was the first example of the proposed ""Jurads"", objects depleted in volatiles and ejected from planetary systems during the post-main sequence evolution of their parent star. I suggest that heating by the star's giant stage fluidized a precursor cometary object as volatiles escaped, causing it to assume the Jacobi ellipsoidal shape of a self-gravitating incompressible liquid. The collision that produced the inferred tumbling motion must have occurred thousands of years after the formation of 1I/2017 U1 `Oumuamua. Jacobi ellipsoids have a unique relation among rotation rate, density and axial ratio.

67476,1,"Nonclassical Particle Transport in 1-D Random Periodic Media We investigate the accuracy of the recently proposed nonclassical transport equation. This equation contains an extra independent variable compared to the classical transport equation (the path-length $s$), and models particle transport taking place in homogenized random media in which a particle's distance-to-collision is not exponentially distributed. To solve the nonclassical equation one needs to know the $s$-dependent ensemble-averaged total cross section, $\Sigma_t(\mu,s)$, or its corresponding path-length distribution function, $p(\mu,s)$. We consider a 1-D spatially periodic system consisting of alternating solid and void layers, randomly placed in the $x$-axis. We obtain an analytical expression for $p(\mu,s)$ and use this result to compute the corresponding $\Sigma_t(\mu,s)$. Then, we proceed to numerically solve the nonclassical equation for different test problems in rod geometry; that is, particles can move only in the directions $\mu=\pm 1$. To assess the accuracy of these solutions, we produce ""benchmark"" results obtained by (i) generating a large number of physical realizations of the system, (ii) numerically solving the transport equation in each realization, and (iii) ensemble-averaging the solutions over all physical realizations. We show that the numerical results validate the nonclassical model; the solutions obtained with the nonclassical equation accurately estimate the ensemble-averaged scalar flux in this 1-D random periodic system, greatly outperforming the widely-used atomic mix model in most problems.",0

67733,1,"Nonparametric Maximum Entropy Estimation on Information Diagrams Maximum entropy estimation is of broad interest for inferring properties of systems across many different disciplines. In this work, we significantly extend a technique we previously introduced for estimating the maximum entropy of a set of random discrete variables when conditioning on bivariate mutual informations and univariate entropies. Specifically, we show how to apply the concept to continuous random variables and vastly expand the types of information-theoretic quantities one can condition on. This allows us to establish a number of significant advantages of our approach over existing ones. Not only does our method perform favorably in the undersampled regime, where existing methods fail, but it also can be dramatically less computationally expensive as the cardinality of the variables increases. In addition, we propose a nonparametric formulation of connected informations and give an illustrative example showing how this agrees with the existing parametric formulation in cases of interest. We further demonstrate the applicability and advantages of our method to real world systems for the case of resting-state human brain networks. Finally, we show how our method can be used to estimate the structural network connectivity between interacting units from observed activity and establish the advantages over other approaches for the case of phase oscillator networks as a generic example.",0
67863,1,"Temperature dependence of the probability of ""small heating"" and spectrum of UCNs up-scattered on the surface of Fomblin oil Y-HVAC 18/8 We performed precision measurements of the probability of small heating and spectrum of UCNs up-scattered on the surface of hydrogen-free oil Fomblin Y-HVAC 18/8 as a function of temperature. The probability is well reproducible, does not depend on sample thickness and does not evolve in time. It is equal (9.8+-0.2)10^(-6) at the ambient temperature. The spectrum coincides with those measured with solid-surface and nanoparticle samples. Indirect arguments indicate that spectrum shape weakly depends on temperature. Measured experimental data can be satisfactory described both within the model of near-surface nanodroplets and the model of capillary waves.",0

Implementation of numerical simulations by the use of AMPS-1D program of one-dimensional analysis of microelectronic and photonic structures for the analysis of hydrogenated silicon solar cells allowed us to formulate the optimal design of new kind of multi-junction tandem solar cells, providing its most efficient operation.

67904,1,"Vacuum spin squeezing We investigate the generation of entanglement (spin squeezing) in an optical-transition atomic clock through the coupling to a vacuum electromagnetic field that is enhanced by an optical cavity. We show that if each atom is prepared in a superposition of the ground state and a long-lived electronic excited state, and viewed as a spin-1/2 system, then the collective vacuum light shift entangles the atoms, resulting in a squeezed distribution of the ensemble collective spin. This scheme reveals that even a vacuum field can be a useful resource for entanglement and quantum manipulation. The method is simple and robust since it requires neither the application of light nor precise frequency control of the ultra-high-finesse cavity. Furthermore, the scheme can be used to implement two-axis twisting by rotating the spin direction while coupling to the vacuum, resulting in stronger squeezing.",0

67940,1,"Conservation in two-particle self-consistent extensions of dynamical-mean-field-theory Extensions of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) make use of quantum impurity models as nonperturbative and exactly solvable reference systems which are essential to treat the strong electronic correlations. Through the introduction of retarded interactions on the impurity, these approximations can be made two-particle self-consistent. This is of interest for the Hubbard model because it allows to suppress the antiferromagnetic phase transition in two dimensions in accordance with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and to include the effects of bosonic fluctuations. For a physically sound description of the latter, the approximation should be conserving. In this paper, we show that the mutual requirements of two-particle self-consistency and conservation lead to fundamental problems. For an approximation that is two-particle self-consistent in the charge and longitudinal spin channels, the double occupancy of the lattice and the impurity is no longer consistent when computed from single-particle properties. For the case of self-consistency in the charge and longitudinal as well as transversal spin channels, these requirements are even mutually exclusive so that no conserving approximation can exist. We illustrate these findings for a two-particle self-consistent and conserving DMFT approximation.",0
67946,1,"AP-Cloud: Adaptive Particle-in-Cloud Method for Optimal Solutions to Vlasov-Poisson Equation We propose a new adaptive Particle-in-Cloud (AP-Cloud) method for obtaining optimal numerical solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson equation. Unlike the traditional particle-in-cell (PIC) method, which is commonly used for solving this problem, the AP-Cloud adaptively selects computational nodes or particles to deliver higher accuracy and efficiency when the particle distribution is highly non-uniform. Unlike other adaptive techniques for PIC, our method balances the errors in PDE discretization and Monte Carlo integration, and discretizes the differential operators using a generalized finite difference (GFD) method based on a weighted least square formulation. As a result, AP-Cloud is independent of the geometric shapes of computational domains and is free of artificial parameters. Efficient and robust implementation is achieved through an octree data structure with 2:1 balance. We analyze the accuracy and convergence order of AP-Cloud theoretically, and verify the method using an electrostatic problem of a particle beam with halo. Simulation results show that the AP-Cloud method is substantially more accurate and faster than the traditional PIC, and it is free of artificial forces that are typical for some adaptive PIC techniques.",0
68015,1,"Effective Hamiltonian theory for nonreciprocal light propagation in magnetic Rashba conductor Rashba spin-orbit interaction leads to a number of electromagnetic cross-correlation effects by inducing a mixing of electric and magnetic degrees of freedom. In this study, we investigate the optical properties of a magnetic Rashba conductor by deriving an effective Hamiltonian based on an imaginary-time path-integral formalism. We show that the effective Hamiltonian can be described in terms of toroidal and quadrupole moments, as has been argued in the case of insulator multiferroics. The toroidal moment turns out to coincide with the spin gauge field induced by the Rashba field. It causes Doppler shift by inducing intrinsic spin current, resulting in anisotropic light propagation (directional dichroism) irrespective of the polarization. The quadrupole moment on the other hand results in a magneto-optical phenomenon such as a Faraday effect for circularly polarized waves.",0
68115,1,"Statistical parity-time-symmetric lasing in an optical fibre network Parity-time (PT)-symmetry in optics is a condition whereby the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index across a photonic structure are deliberately balanced. This balance can lead to interesting optical phenomena, such as unidirectional invisibility, loss-induced lasing, single-mode lasing from multimode resonators, and non-reciprocal effects in conjunction with nonlinearities. Because PT-symmetry has been thought of as fragile, experimental realisations to date have been usually restricted to on-chip micro-devices. Here, we demonstrate that certain features of PT-symmetry are sufficiently robust to survive the statistical fluctuations associated with a macroscopic optical cavity. We examine the lasing dynamics in optical fibre-based coupled cavities more than a kilometre in length with balanced gain and loss. Although fluctuations can detune the cavity by more than the free spectral range, the behaviour of the lasing threshold and the laser power is that expected from a PT-stable system. Furthermore, we observe a statistical symmetry breaking upon varying the cavity loss.",0

By studying lattice dynamics of the Sn filled skutterudite SnFe4Sb12, we find Sn off-centers in its coordination cage in contrast to the common rare earth fillers. This leads to low-frequency Goldstone-like modes below 1 THz associated mainly with Sn motions. Importantly, these involve collective motion of other atoms, especially Sb, in the host skutterudite lattice. The optical modes transversing to the Sn off-centering direction are identified as Goldstone type modes in association with a three-dimensional Mexican-hat-like potential energy surface. The interaction of these collective Goldstone modes with the host heat-carrying phonons is shown to lead to ultralow lattice thermal conductivity.",0

To show this, we construct a positive-operator-valued measure for two distinct time-of-arrival measurements in a bipartite system, and we prove that the resulting probabilities differ strongly from ones defined in terms of probability currents. We also prove that time-of-arrival correlations are entanglement witnesses, a result suggesting the use of temporal observables for quantum information processing tasks. Finally, we construct the probabilities for sequential time-of-arrival measurements on a single particle. We derive the state-reduction rule for time-of-arrival measurements; it differs significantly from the standard one, because time-of-arrival measurements are not defined at a single predetermined moment of time.",0

In this paper, we examine this problem and propose a method for estimating the Shannon entropy for a set of ranked symbolic natural events. Using a modified Zipf-Mandelbrot-Li law and a new rank-based coincidence counting method, we propose an efficient algorithm which enables the entropy to be estimated with surprising accuracy using only a small number of samples. The algorithm is tested on some natural sequences and shown to yield accurate results with very small amounts of data.",0
68591,1,"From time-series to complex networks: Application to the cerebrovascular flow patterns in atrial fibrillation A network-based approach is presented to investigate the cerebrovascular flow patterns during atrial fibrillation (AF) with respect to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). AF, the most common cardiac arrhythmia with faster and irregular beating, has been recently and independently associated with the increased risk of dementia. However, the underlying hemodynamic mechanisms relating the two pathologies remain mainly undetermined so far; thus the contribution of modeling and refined statistical tools is valuable. Pressure and flow rate temporal series in NSR and AF are here evaluated along representative cerebral sites (from carotid arteries to capillary brain circulation), exploiting reliable artificially built signals recently obtained from an in silico approach. The complex network analysis evidences, in a synthetic and original way, a dramatic signal variation towards the distal/capillary cerebral regions during AF, which has no counterpart in NSR conditions. At the large artery level, networks obtained from both AF and NSR hemodynamic signals exhibit elongated and chained features, which are typical of pseudo-periodic series. These aspects are almost completely lost towards the microcirculation during AF, where the networks are topologically more circular and present random-like characteristics. As a consequence, all the physiological phenomena at microcerebral level ruled by periodicity - such as regular perfusion, mean pressure per beat, and average nutrient supply at cellular level - can be strongly compromised, since the AF hemodynamic signals assume irregular behaviour and random-like features. Through a powerful approach which is complementary to the classical statistical tools, the present findings further strengthen the potential link between AF hemodynamic and cognitive decline.",0

However, direct output signals from superconducting devices (e.g., Josephson junctions) are usually not compatible with the input requirements of conventional devices (e.g., transistors). Here, we demonstrate the use of a single three-terminal superconducting-nanowire device, called the nanocryotron (nTron), as a digital comparator to combine SFQ circuits with mature semiconductor circuits such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. Since SFQ circuits can digitize output signals from general superconducting devices and CMOS circuits can interface existing CMOS-compatible electronics, our results demonstrate the feasibility of a general architecture that uses an nTron as an interface to realize a 'super-hybrid' system consisting of superconducting detectors, superconducting quantum electronics, CMOS logic gates and memories, and other conventional electronics.",0

Given that the Laplacian operator is intrinsically implied in the analysis of dynamic processes (e.g., random walks) occurring on the graph, as well as in the investigation of the dynamical properties of connected structures themselves (e.g., vibrational structures and the relaxation modes), this result allows addressing analytically a large class of problems.

In this work we investigate a two-dimensional sine-Gordon model perturbed by a family of localized forces. We observed the formation of bubblelike and droplike structures due to local internal shape mode instabilities. We describe the formation of such structures on the basis of a one-dimensional theory of activation of internal modes of sine-Gordon solitons. An interpretation of the observed phenomena, in the context of phase transition theory, is given. Implications in Josephson junctions with a current dipole device are discussed.",0

In vacuo preparation and inert transfer of oxide-free CdTe surfaces isolated the separate effects of CdCl$_2$ treatment and ambient oxygen exposure. Qualitatively, grain boundaries displayed lower work function and downward band bending relative to grain interiors, but only after air exposure of CdCl$_2$-treated CdTe. Analysis of numerous space charge regions at grain boundaries (GBs) showed an average depletion width of 290 nm and an average band bending magnitude of 70 meV, corresponding to a GB trap density of 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a net carrier density of 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$.

We derive sharp decay estimates using a variant of the vector-field method introduced in previous work. More precisely, we construct modified vector fields, depending on the solutions, to propagate $L^1$-bounds for the distribution function and its derivatives. The modified vector fields are designed to have improved commutation properties with the transport operator and yet to still provide sufficient control on the solutions to allow for a sharp Klainerman-Sobolev type inequality.

70349,1,"Investigating echo state networks dynamics by means of recurrence analysis In this paper, we elaborate over the well-known interpretability issue in echo state networks. The idea is to investigate the dynamics of reservoir neurons with time-series analysis techniques taken from research on complex systems. Notably, we analyze time-series of neuron activations with Recurrence Plots (RPs) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), which permit to visualize and characterize high-dimensional dynamical systems. We show that this approach is useful in a number of ways. First, the two-dimensional representation offered by RPs provides a way for visualizing the high-dimensional dynamics of a reservoir. Our results suggest that, if the network is stable, reservoir and input denote similar line patterns in the respective RPs. Conversely, the more unstable the ESN, the more the RP of the reservoir presents instability patterns. As a second result, we show that the $\mathrm{L_{max}}$ measure is highly correlated with the well-established maximal local Lyapunov exponent. This suggests that complexity measures based on RP diagonal lines distribution provide a valuable tool to quantify the degree of network stability. Finally, our analysis shows that all RQA measures fluctuate on the proximity of the so-called edge of stability, where an ESN typically achieves maximum computational capability. We verify that the determination of the edge of stability provided by such RQA measures is more accurate than two well-known criteria based on the Jacobian matrix of the reservoir. Therefore, we claim that RPs and RQA-based analyses can be used as valuable tools to design an effective network given a specific problem.",0

By minimising the free energy of the system, the critical value $\Omega_0$ of the angular velocity for the formation of the first vortex line is determined. This value nontrivially depends on the temperature, and numerical estimations of its temperature behaviour are produced.

For example, our method shows that a suitable one-parameter family of coupled Hamiltonians whose ground states transform from an initially factorizing state to a final cluster state on a lattice of arbitrary dimension is dual to a family of trivial decoupled Hamiltonians containing local on-site terms only. As a consequence, the minimum energy gap (which determines the adiabatic run-time) does not scale with system size, which facilitates an efficient and simple adiabatic preparation of e.g. the two-dimensional cluster state used for measurement-based quantum computation.",0

We study a model of particles in storage rings that is described by a chaotic symplectic map. Ignoring the resonances, the dynamics typically has a finite region in phase space where it is stable. Inherent noise in the system leads to particle loss from this stable region. The competition of this noise with radiation damping, which increases stability, determines the escape rate. Determining this `aperture' and finding escape rates is therefore an important physical problem. We compare the results of two different perturbation theories and a variational method to estimate this stable region. Including noise, we derive analytical estimates for the steady-state populations (and the resulting beam emittance), for the escape rate in the small damping regime, and compare them with numerical simulations.",0

Our index displays a sharp peak (high localization) during EP events, whereas during CP events (larger dispersion) it remains close to the baseline observed during normal periods. In contrast to previous classification schemes, our approach specifically account for El Ni\~no's global impacts. We confirm recent El Ni\~no classifications for the years 1951 to 2014 and assign types to those cases were former works yielded ambiguous results. Ultimately, we study La Ni\~na episodes and demonstrate that our index provides a similar discrimination into two types.",0

However, a proper understanding of the connection between the radiation-induced microstructural behavior of a grain boundary and its impact at long natural time scales is still missing. In this Letter, point defect absorption at interfaces is summarized by a jump Robin-type condition at a coarse-grained level, wherein the role of interface microstructure is effectively taken into account. Then a concise formula linking the sink strength of a polycrystalline aggregate with its grain size is introduced and is well compared with experimental observation. Based on the derived model, a coarse-grained formulation incorporating the coupled evolution of grain boundaries and point defects is proposed, so as to underpin the study of long-time morphological evolution of grains induced by irradiation. Our simulation results suggest that the presence of point defect sources within a grain further accelerates its shrinking process, and radiation tends to trigger the extension of twin boundary sections.",0
71030,1,"Effective gauge field theory of spintronics The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive theory of spintronics phenomena based on the concept of effective gauge field, the spin gauge field. An effective gauge field generally arises when we change a basis to describe system and describes low energy properties of the system. In the case of ferromagnetic metals we consider, it arises from structures of localized spin (magnetization) and couples to spin current of conduction electron. The first half of the paper is devoted to quantum mechanical arguments and phenomenology. We show that the spin gauge field has adiabatic and nonadiabatic (off-diagonal) components, consisting an SU(2) gauge field. The adiabatic component gives rise to spin Berry's phase, topological Hall effect and spin motive force, while nonadiabatic components are essential for spin-transfer torque and spin pumping effects by inducing nonequilibrium spin accumulation.

71159,1,"Annihilation of positronium atoms confined in mesoporous and macroporous SiO$_2$ films We report experiments in which positronium (Ps) atoms were created in thin, porous silica films containing isolated voids with diameters ranging from 5 to 75 nm. Ps lifetimes in the pore structures were measured directly via time-delayed laser excitation of 13S1→23PJ transitions. In a film containing 5-nm pores Ps was predominantly emitted into vacuum, with a small component of confined Ps with a lifetime of 75 ns also observed. In films with larger pores Ps atoms were not emitted into vacuum except from the film surface, and confined Ps lifetimes of ≈90 ns were measured with no dependence on the pore size. However, for such large pores, extended Tao-Eldrup (ETE)-type models predict Ps lifetimes close to the 142-ns vacuum value. Moreover, 13S1→23PJ excitation of Ps atoms inside the pores was found to result in annihilation and exhibited an extremely broad (≈10 THz) linewidth. We attribute these observations to a process in which nonthermal Ps atoms in the isolated voids become temporarily trapped in a series of surface states that dissociate following excitation. The occurrence of this mechanism is not necessarily apparent from ground-state Ps decay rates without some prior knowledge of the sample structure, and it precludes the application of ETE-type models as they do not take into account surface interactions other than pickoff annihilation.",0

The quantum socket is based on spring-mounted micro wires the three-dimensional wires that push directly on a micro-fabricated chip, making electrical contact. A small wire cross section (~1 mmm), nearly non-magnetic components, and functionality at low temperatures make the quantum socket ideal to operate solid-state qubits.

71411,1,"Hyperspherical harmonics expansion on Lagrange meshes for bosonic systems in one dimension A one-dimensional system of bosons interacting with contact and single-Gaussian forces is studied with an expansion in hyperspherical harmonics. The hyperradial potentials are calculated using the link between the hyperspherical harmonics and the single-particle harmonic-oscillator basis while the coupled hyperradial equations are solved with the Lagrange-mesh method. Extensions of this method are proposed to achieve good convergence with small numbers of mesh points for any truncation of hypermomentum. The convergence with hypermomentum strongly depends on the range of the two-body forces: it is very good for large ranges but deteriorates as the range decreases, being the worst for the contact interaction. In all cases, the lowest-order energy is within 4.5 $\%$ of the exact solution and shows the correct cubic asymptotic behaviour at large boson numbers. Details of the convergence studies are presented for 3, 5, 20 and 100 bosons. A special treatment for three bosons was found to be necessary. For single-Gaussian interactions, the convergence rate improves with increasing boson number, similar to what happens in the case of three-dimensional systems of bosons.",0
71412,1,"Calibrating Long Period Variables as Standard Candles with Machine Learning Variable stars with well-calibrated period-luminosity relationships provide accurate distance measurements to nearby galaxies and are therefore a vital tool for cosmology and astrophysics. While these measurements typically rely on samples of Cepheid and RR-Lyrae stars, abundant populations of luminous variable stars with longer periods of $10 - 1000$ days remain largely unused. We apply machine learning to derive a mapping between lightcurve features of these variable stars and their magnitude to extend the traditional period-luminosity (PL) relation commonly used for Cepheid samples. Using photometric data for long period variable stars in the Large Magellanic cloud (LMC), we demonstrate that our predictions produce residual errors comparable to those obtained on the corresponding Cepheid population. We show that our model generalizes well to other samples by performing a blind test on photometric data from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our predictions on the SMC again show small residual errors and biases, comparable to results that employ PL relations fitted on Cepheid samples. The residual biases are complementary between the long period variable and Cepheid fits, which provides exciting prospects to better control sources of systematic error in cosmological distance measurements. We finally show that the proposed methodology can be used to optimize samples of variable stars as standard candles independent of any prior variable star classification.",0

71638,1,"Quantum paramagnet and frustrated quantum criticality in a spin-one diamond lattice antiferromagnet Motivated by the proposal of a topological quantum paramagnet in the diamond lattice antiferromagnet NiRh2O4, we propose a minimal model to describe the magnetic interaction and properties of the diamond material with spin-one local moments. Our model includes the first- and second-neighbor Heisenberg interactions as well as a local single-ion spin anisotropy that is allowed by the spin-one nature of the local moment and the tetragonal symmetry of the system. We point out that there exists a quantum phase transition from a trivial quantum paramagnet when single-ion spin anisotropy is dominant to the magnetic ordered states when the exchange is dominant. Due to the frustrated spin interaction, the magnetic excitation in the quantum paramagnetic state supports extensively degenerate band minima in the spectra. As the system approaches the transition, extensively degenerate bosonic modes become critical at the criticality, giving rise to unusual magnetic properties. Our phase diagram and experimental predictions for different phases provide a guideline for the identification of the ground state for NiRh2O4. Although our results are fundamentally different from the proposal for topological quantum paramagnets, they represent interesting possibilities for spin-one diamond lattice antiferromagnets.",0
71717,1,"Normal behaviour models for wind turbine vibrations: An alternative approach The identification of abnormal behaviour in mechanical systems is key to anticipate and avoid their potential failure. Thus wind turbine health is commonly assessed monitoring series of $10$-minute SCADA and high frequency data from sensors. To monitor wind turbine vibrations, normal behaviour models are built to predict tower top accelerations and drive-train vibrations. Signal deviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further investigated. More efficient models are expected to help enhancing the identification of abnormal behaviour. In this paper we assess a stochastic approach to reconstruct the $1$ Hz tower top acceleration signal, which was measured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German North Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction with that of a model based on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining algorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. In order to focus the discussion on the similarities and differences of both approaches, we limit our evaluation to a single input-output system; in doing so, we avoid other differences, i.e. loading type, pre-processing or model complexity. Our results present evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in the high frequency domain ($1$ Hz). Although neural network retrieve accurate step-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach predictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the original signal, remaining high accuracy levels. The implementation of our stochastic approach is available as open source code and can easily be adapted for other situations involving stochastic data reconstruction. Based on our findings we argue that such an approach could be implemented in signal reconstruction for monitoring purposes or for abnormal behaviour detection.",0
71727,1,"Simulated Annealing Approach to the Temperature-Emissivity Separation Problem in Thermal Remote Sensing Part One: Mathematical Background The method of simulated annealing is adapted to the temperature-emissivity separation (TES) problem. A patch of surface at the bottom of the atmosphere is assumed to be a greybody emitter with spectral emissivity $\epsilon(k)$ describable by a mixture of spectral endmembers. We prove that a simulated annealing search conducted according to a suitable schedule converges to a solution maximizing the $\textit{A-Posteriori}$ probability that spectral radiance detected at the top of the atmosphere originates from a patch with stipulated $T$ and $\epsilon(k)$. Any such solution will be nonunique. The average of a large number of simulated annealing solutions, however, converges almost surely to a unique Maximum A-Posteriori solution for $T$ and $\epsilon(k)$. The limitation to a stipulated set of endmember emissivities may be relaxed by allowing the number of endmembers to grow without bound, and to be generic continuous functions of wavenumber with bounded first derivatives with respect to wavenumber.",0

72203,1,"Optimised frequency modulation for continuous-wave optical magnetic resonance sensing using nitrogen-vacancy ensembles Magnetometers based on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centres are a promising platform for continuously sensing static and low-frequency magnetic fields. Their combination with phase-sensitive (lock-in) detection creates a highly versatile sensor with a sensitivity that is proportional to the derivative of the optical magnetic resonance lock-in spectrum, which is in turn dependant on the lock-in modulation parameters. Here we study the dependence of the lock-in spectral slope on the modulation of the spin-driving microwave field. Given the presence of the intrinsic nitrogen hyperfine spin transitions, we experimentally show that when the ratio between the hyperfine linewidth and their separation is $\gtrsim 1/4$, square-wave based frequency modulation generates the steepest slope at modulation depths exceeding the separation of the hyperfine lines, compared to sine-wave based modulation. We formulate a model for calculating lock-in spectra which shows excellent agreement with our experiments, and which shows that an optimum slope is achieved when the linewidth/separation ratio is $\lesssim 1/4$ and the modulation depth is less then the resonance linewidth, irrespective of the modulation function used.",0
72216,1,"Comparison of three Statistical Classification Techniques for Maser Identification We applied three statistical classification techniques—linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression, and random forests—to three astronomical datasets associated with searches for interstellar masers. We compared the performance of these methods in identifying whether specific mid-infrared or millimetre continuum sources are likely to have associated interstellar masers. We also discuss the interpretability of the results of each classification technique. Non-parametric methods have the potential to make accurate predictions when there are complex relationships between critical parameters. We found that for the small datasets the parametric methods logistic regression and LDA performed best, for the largest dataset the non-parametric method of random forests performed with comparable accuracy to parametric techniques, rather than any significant improvement. This suggests that at least for the specific examples investigated here accuracy of the predictions obtained is not being limited by the use of parametric models. We also found that for LDA, transformation of the data to match a normal distribution led to a significant improvement in accuracy. The different classification techniques had significant overlap in their predictions; further astronomical observations will enable the accuracy of these predictions to be tested.",0
72252,1,"Entropic selection of concepts unveils hidden topics in documents corpora The organization and evolution of science has recently become itself an object of scientific quantitative investigation, thanks to the wealth of information that can be extracted from scientific documents, such as citations between papers and co-authorship between researchers. However, only few studies have focused on the concepts that characterize full documents and that can be extracted and analyzed, revealing the deeper organization of scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, several concepts can be so common across documents that they hinder the emergence of the underlying topical structure of the document corpus, because they give rise to a large amount of spurious and trivial relations among documents. To identify and remove common concepts, we introduce a method to gauge their relevance according to an objective information-theoretic measure related to the statistics of their occurrence across the document corpus. After progressively removing concepts that, according to this metric, can be considered as generic, we find that the topic organization displays a correspondingly more refined structure.",0

For example, it is believed that a trivial band insulator can be twisted into topological phase by increasing spin-orbital coupling or changing the parameters of crystal lattice.

In the present paper the stability of these solutions will be established. The variational equation, which is only weakly parabolic, and has highly singular coefficients, will be shown to have unique strong solutions up to addition of a vertical solution. Initial data will be taken to be in Sobolev class one-half. The proof relies on an infinitesimal version of the ZDS procedure: one solves first an augmented, strictly parabolic version of the variational equation and then adds to the solution a function which is vertical along the original path. Energy inequalities and Neumann domination techniques will be used to establish apriori initial behavior for solutions.",0

It describes two classes of computational methods to leverage data for modeling dynamical systems. The first is concerned with data fitting algorithms to estimate parameters in parametric models that are postulated on the basis of physical or dynamical laws. The second class is on operator estimation, which uses the data to nonparametrically approximate the operator generated by the transition function of the underlying dynamical systems.

Useful optimality results are established for the associated posterior error covariance matrix and posterior mean approximations, which are further investigated in a numerical experiment consisting of a large-scale atmospheric tracer transport source-inversion problem. This method proves to be a robust and efficient approach to dimension reduction, as well as a natural framework to analyze the information content of the inversion.

73913,1,"Improved Landauer's principle and generalized second law of thermodynamics with initial correlations and non-equilibrium surrounding environments Traditional form of the second law of thermodynamics is strongly restricted by three conditions: One is the initial joint state of the system and surroundings should be a product state, so that there exists no initial correlations. The second is the initial states of surroundings are in equilibrium thermodynamics. And the end is weak couplings between the system and surroundings. This formulation of the second law should be reexamined in order to understand the relations of thermodynamics and information theory, especially, when existing initial correlations. In this work, using the techniques of quantum statistical mechanics for thermodynamics and quantum information science, we recast fundamental laws of thermodynamics from theoretical information point of view. Initial correlations between the system and surroundings are considered, which evolves thermodynamically and result in modifications of the traditional formulations. We obtained improved forms of the entropy increase, Landauer's principle, and the second law of thermodynamics, which are exhibited as equalities rather than inequalities, and through which physical nature of information can be demonstrated precisely. Further, using the language totally belongs to quantum information theory, we give the direction of natural evolution process a new statement: the evolution of an isolated quantum system, where no correlations exist between subsystems, initially, always towards to directions of the correlation information never be decreased. Such result indicates that the traditional principle of entropy increase can be redescribed using information theory, identically.",0

METHODS In this multiinstitutional retrospective study, the authors identified 52 pregnancies in 50 women diagnosed with a glioma. RESULTS For gliomas known prior to pregnancy (n = 24), we found the following: 1) An increase in the quantified imaging growth rates occurred during pregnancy in 87% of cases. 2) Clinical deterioration occurred in 38% of cases, with seizures alone resolving after delivery in 57.2% of cases. 3) Oncological treatments were immediately performed after delivery in 25% of cases. For gliomas diagnosed during pregnancy (n = 28), we demonstrated the following: 1) The tumor was discovered during the second and third trimesters in 29% and 54% of cases, respectively, with seizures being the presenting symptom in 68% of cases. 2) The quantified imaging growth rates did not significantly decrease after delivery and before oncological treatment. 3) Clinical deterioration resolved after delivery in 21.4% of cases. 4) Oncological treatments were immediately performed after delivery in 70% of cases. Gliomas with a high grade of malignancy, negative immunoexpression of alpha-internexin, or positive immunoexpression for p53 were more likely to be associated with tumor progression during pregnancy. Deliveries were all uneventful (cesarean section in 54.5% of cases and vaginal delivery in 45.5%), and the infants were developmentally normal. CONCLUSIONS When a woman harboring a glioma envisions a pregnancy, or when a glioma is discovered in a pregnant patient, the authors suggest informing her and her partner that pregnancy may impact the evolution of the glioma clinically and radiologically.

Electron viscous flows are governed by a nonlocal current-field relation which renders the spatial patterns of the current and electric field strikingly dissimilar. Notably, driven by the viscous friction force from adjacent layers, current can flow against the electric field, generating negative resistance, vorticity, and vortices. Moreover, different current flows can result in identical potential distributions.

74363,1,"Improvement of PolSAR Decomposition Scattering Powers Using a Relative Decorrelation Measure In this letter, a methodology is proposed to improve the scattering powers obtained from model-based decomposition using Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data. The novelty of this approach lies in utilizing the intrinsic information in the off-diagonal elements of the 3$\times$3 coherency matrix $\mathbf{T}$ represented in the form of complex correlation coefficients. Two complex correlation coefficients are computed between co-polarization and cross-polarization components of the Pauli scattering vector. The difference between modulus of complex correlation coefficients corresponding to $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{opt}}$ (i.e. the degree of polarization (DOP) optimized coherency matrix), and $\mathbf{T}$ (original) matrices is obtained. Then a suitable scaling is performed using fractions \emph{i.e.,} $(T_{ii}^{\mathrm{opt}}/\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}T_{ii}^{\mathrm{opt}})$ obtained from the diagonal elements of the $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{opt}}$ matrix. Thereafter, these new quantities are used in modifying the Yamaguchi 4-component scattering powers obtained from $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{opt}}$. To corroborate the fact that these quantities have physical relevance, a quantitative analysis of these for the L-band AIRSAR San Francisco and the L-band Kyoto images is illustrated. Finally, the scattering powers obtained from the proposed methodology are compared with the corresponding powers obtained from the Yamaguchi \emph{et. al.,} 4-component (Y4O) decomposition and the Yamaguchi \emph{et. al.,} 4-component Rotated (Y4R) decomposition for the same data sets. The proportion of negative power pixels is also computed. The results show an improvement on all these attributes by using the proposed methodology.",0
74472,1,"Nonlinear Relaxation Phenomena in Metastable Condensed Matter Systems Nonlinear relaxation phenomena in three different systems of condensed matter are investigated. (i) First, the phase dynamics in Josephson junctions is analyzed. Specifically, a superconductor-graphene-superconductor (SGS) system exhibits quantum metastable states, and the average escape time from these metastable states in the presence of Gaussian and correlated fluctuations is calculated, accounting for variations in the the noise source intensity and the bias frequency. Moreover, the transient dynamics of a long-overlap Josephson junction (JJ) subject to thermal fluctuations and non-Gaussian noise sources is investigated. Noise induced phenomena are observed, such as the noise enhanced stability and the stochastic resonant activation. (ii) Second, the electron spin relaxation process in a n-type GaAs bulk driven by a fluctuating electric field is investigated. In particular, by using a Monte Carlo approach, we study the influence of a random telegraph noise on the spin polarized transport. Our findings show the possibility to raise the spin relaxation length by increasing the amplitude of the external fluctuations. Moreover, we find that, crucially, depending on the value of the external field strength, the electron spin depolarization length versus the noise correlation time increases up to a plateau. (iii) Finally, the stabilization of quantum metastable states by dissipation is presented. Normally, quantum fluctuations enhance the escape from metastable states in the presence of dissipation. We show that dissipation can enhance the stability of a quantum metastable system, consisting of a particle moving in a strongly asymmetric double well potential, interacting with a thermal bath. We find that the escape time from the metastable region has a nonmonotonic behavior versus the system- bath coupling and the temperature, producing a stabilizing effect.",0

74670,1,"Plasmon-driven acceleration in a photo-excited nanotube A plasmon-assisted channeling acceleration can be realized with a large channel, possibly at the nanometer scale. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the most typical example of nano-channels that can confine a large number of channeled particles in a photon-plasmon coupling condition. This paper presents a theoretical and numerical study on the concept of high-field charge acceleration driven by photo-excited Luttinger-liquid plasmons in a nanotube [Z. Shi et al., Nat. Photonics 9, 515 (2015)]. An analytic description of the plasmon-assisted laser acceleration is detailed with practical acceleration parameters, in particular, with the specifications of a typical tabletop femtosecond laser system. The maximally achievable acceleration gradients and energy gains within dephasing lengths and CNT lengths are discussed with respect to laser-incident angles and CNT-filling ratios.",0
74699,1,"Solar Wind Charge Exchange contribution to the ROSAT All Sky Survey Maps DXL (Diffuse X-ray emission from the Local Galaxy) is a sounding rocket mission designed to estimate the contribution of solar wind charge eXchange (SWCX) to the diffuse X-ray background and to help determine the properties of the Local Hot Bubble. The detectors are large area thin-window proportional counters with a spectral response that is similar to that of the PSPC used in the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS). A direct comparison of DXL and RASS data for the same part of the sky viewed from quite different vantage points in the solar system, and the assumption of approximate isotropy for the solar wind, allowed us to quantify the SWCX contribution to all six RASS bands (R1–R7, excluding R3). We find that the SWCX contribution at $l=140^\circ ,b=0^\circ $, where the DXL path crosses the Galactic plane, is $33 \% \pm 6 \% (\mathrm{statistical})\pm 12 \% (\mathrm{systematic})$ for R1, $44 \% \pm 6 \% \pm 5 \% $ for R2, $18 \% \pm 12 \% \pm 11 \% $ for R4, $14 \% \pm 11 \% \pm 9 \% $ for R5, and negligible for the R6 and R7 bands. Reliable models for the distribution of neutral H and He in the solar system permit estimation of the contribution of interplanetary SWCX emission over the the whole sky and correction of the RASS maps. We find that the average SWCX contribution in the whole sky is $26 \% \pm 6 \% \pm 13 \% $ for R1, $30 \% \pm 4 \% \pm 4 \% $ for R2, $8 \% \pm 5 \% \pm 5 \% $ for R4, $6 \% \pm 4 \% \pm 4 \% $ for R5, and negligible for R6 and R7.",0

75116,1,"Solar plasma radio emission in the presence of imbalanced turbulence of kinetic-scale Alfv\'en waves We study the influence of kinetic-scale Alfv\'enic turbulence on the generation of plasma radio emission in the solar coronal regions where the plasma/magnetic pressure ratio $\beta $ is smaller than the electron/ion mass ratio $m_{e}/m_{i}$. The present study is motivated by the phenomenon of solar type I radio storms associated with the strong magnetic field of active regions. The measured brightness temperature of the type I storms can be up to $10^{10}$ K for continuum emission, and can exceed $10^{11}$ K for type I bursts. At present, there is no generally accepted theory explaining such high brightness temperatures and some other properties of the type I storms. We propose the model with the imbalanced turbulence of kinetic-scale Alfv\'en waves producing an asymmetric quasilinear plateau on the upward half of the electron velocity distribution. The Landau damping of resonant Langmuir waves is suppressed and their amplitudes grow spontaneously above the thermal level. The estimated saturation level of Langmuir waves is high enough to generate observed type I radio emission at the fundamental plasma frequency. Harmonic emission does not appear in our model because the backward-propagating Langmuir waves undergo a strong Landau damping. Our model predicts $100\%$ polarization in the sense of the ordinary (o-) mode of type I emission.",0
75287,1,"Edge States and Broken Symmetry Phases of Laterally Confined $^3$He Films Broken symmetries in topological condensed matter systems have implications for the spectrum of Fermionic excitations confined on surfaces or topological defects. The Fermionic spectrum of confined (quasi-2D) $^3$He-A consists of branches of chiral edge states. The negative energy states are related to the ground-state angular momentum, $L_z = (N/2) \hbar$, for $N/2$ Cooper pairs. The power law suppression of the angular momentum, $L_z(T) \simeq (N/2)\,\hbar\,[1 - \frac{2}{3}(\pi T/\Delta)^2 ]$ for $0 \le T \ll T_c$, in the fully gapped 2D chiral A-phase reflects the thermal excitation of the chiral edge Fermions. We discuss the effects of wave function overlap, and hybridization between edge states confined near opposing surfaces on the edge currents, ground-state angular momentum and ground-state order parameter. Under strong lateral confinement, the chiral A phase undergoes a sequence of phase transitions, first to a pair density wave (PDW) phase with broken translational symmetry at $D_{c2} \approx 16 \xi_0$. The PDW phase is described by a periodic array of chiral domains with alternating chirality, separated by domain walls. The period of PDW phase diverges as the confinement length $D\rightarrow D_{c_2}$. The PDW phase breaks time-reversal symmetry, translation invariance, but is invariant under the combination of time-reversal and translation by a one-half period of the PDW. The mass current distribution of the PDW phase reflects this combined symmetry, and orignates from the spectra of edge Fermions and the chiral branches bound to the domain walls. Under sufficiently strong confinement a second-order transition occurs to the non-chiral ""polar phase"" at $D_{c1} \approx 9\xi_0$, in which a single p-wave orbital state of Cooper pairs is aligned along the channel.",0
75354,1,"Integrated optomechanics and single-photon detection in diamond photonic integrated circuits The development of quantum computers and quantum simulators promises to provide solutions to problems, which can currently not be solved on classical computers. Finding the best physical implementation for such technologies is an important research topic and using optical effects is a promising route towards this goal. It was theoretically shown that optical quantum computing is possible using only single-photon sources and detectors, and linear optical circuits. An experimental implementation of such quantum optical circuits requires a stable, robust and scalable architecture. This can be achieved via miniaturization of the optical devices in the form of photonic integrated circuits (PICs). The development of a suitable material platform for such PICs could therefore have a large impact on future technologies. Diamond is a particularly attractive material here, as it naturally offers a range of optically active defects, which can act as single-photon sources, quantum memories, or sensor elements. Besides its excellent optical properties, diamond also has a very high Young's modulus, which is important for optomechanics, and can be employed for potentially fast and low-loss tuning of PICs after fabrication. In this work, components for future quantum optical circuits are developed. This includes the first diamond optomechanical elements, as well as the first integrated single-photon detectors on a diamond material platform. Diamond micromechanical resonators with high quality factors are realized and their actuation via optical gradient forces and electrostatic forces is demonstrated. The accomplished superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors show excellent performance in terms of low timing jitter, high detection efficiency, and low noise-equivalent power. Moreover, a novel scalable method for PIC fabrication from high quality single crystal diamond is presented.",0
75371,1,"Anti-Kählerian Geometry on Lie Groups Let G be a Lie group of even dimension and let (g, J) be a left invariant anti-Kähler structure on G. In this article we study anti-Kähler structures considering the distinguished cases where the complex structure J is abelian or bi-invariant. We find that if G admits a left invariant anti-Kähler structure (g, J) where J is abelian then the Lie algebra of G is unimodular and (G, g) is a flat pseudo-Riemannian manifold. For the second case, we see that for any left invariant metric g for which J is an anti-isometry we obtain that the triple (G, g, J) is an anti-Kähler manifold. Besides, given a left invariant anti-Hermitian structure on G we associate a covariant 3-tensor 𝜃 on its Lie algebra and prove that such structure is anti-Kähler if and only if 𝜃 is a skew-symmetric and pure tensor. From this tensor we classify the real 4-dimensional Lie algebras for which the corresponding Lie group has a left invariant anti-Kähler structure and study the moduli spaces of such structures (up to group isomorphisms that preserve the anti-Kähler structures).",0

Let $V_1,..., V_n$ be complex vector spaces of dimension $d_1,...,d_n$ and let $G= SL_{d_1} \times \dots \times SL_{d_n}$. Geometrically, we ask given $(d_1,...,d_n)$, when is the geometric invariant theory quotient $\mathbb{P}(V_1 \otimes \dots \otimes V_n)// G$ non-empty? This is equivalent to the quantum mechanical question of whether the multipart quantum system with Hilbert space $V_1\otimes \dots \otimes V_n$ has a locally maximally entangled state, i.e. a state such that the density matrix for each elementary subsystem is a multiple of the identity. We show that the answer to this question is yes if and only if $R(d_1,...,d_n)\geqslant 0$ where \[ R(d_1,...,d_n) = \prod_i d_i +\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^k \sum_{1\leq i_1<\dotsb <i_k\leq n} (\gcd(d_{i_1},\dotsc ,d_{i_k}) )^{2}. \] We also provide a simple recursive algorithm which determines the answer to the question, and we compute the dimension of the resulting quotient in the non-empty cases.",0
75613,1,"Simultaneous Estimation of Noise Variance and Number of Peaks in Bayesian Spectral Deconvolution The heuristic identification of peaks from noisy complex spectra often leads to misunderstanding of the physical and chemical properties of matter. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Bayesian inference, which enables us to separate multipeak spectra into single peaks statistically and consists of two steps. The first step is estimating both the noise variance and the number of peaks as hyperparameters based on Bayes free energy, which generally is not analytically tractable. The second step is fitting the parameters of each peak function to the given spectrum by calculating the posterior density, which has a problem of local minima and saddles since multipeak models are nonlinear and hierarchical. Our framework enables the escape from local minima or saddles by using the exchange Monte Carlo method and calculates Bayes free energy via the multiple histogram method. We discuss a simulation demonstrating how efficient our framework is and show that estimating both the noise variance and the number of peaks prevents overfitting, overpenalizing, and misunderstanding the precision of parameter estimation.",0

75781,1,"Doppler shifts on the spin period of the intermediate polar FO Aqr with K2 We analyse the K2 short cadence data of the intermediate polar FO Aqr and provide accurate and updated orbital and spin periodicities. We additionally find small spin period changes as a function of orbital phase of ~0.02 seconds translating to velocities of ~ a few km/s. The obtained orbital-folded velocity profile displays two clear maxima and minima, and cannot be explained by the radial velocity of the orbiting white dwarf. Instead we propose that the observed velocities are the sum of the radial velocities of both the white dwarf and of the stellar surface facing the white dwarf which reprocesses the WD spin pulses. This combination can explain the observed low velocities in FO Aqr. However asymmetries in the orbital configuration are required to explain the double peaked velocity profile. One possible scenario would invoke binary eccentricity. We thus developed a simple binary model to explain and fit our observations, and find a small binary eccentricity of e=0.03. Although small, persistent eccentricity in a close interacting binary would induce enhanced mass transfer occurring preferentially at periastron passages. We thus discuss alternative scenarios where other asymmetries might explain our observations assuming circular orbits. Since FO Aqr is the first system where the combined radial velocities of both the WD and secondary surface have been measured, it is possible that other mass-transferring binaries also display similar velocity curves when observed with Kepler. These will provide additional valuable tests to either confirm or rule out small eccentricities in similar systems.",0

75906,1,"Non-linear hydrodynamic instability and turbulence in eccentric astrophysical discs with vertical structure Non-linear evolution of the parametric instability of inertial waves inherent to eccentric discs is studied by way of a new local numerical model. Mode coupling of tidal deformation with the disc eccentricity is known to produce exponentially growing eccentricities at certain mean-motion resonances. However, the details of an efficient saturation mechanism balancing this growth still are not fully understood. This paper develops a local numerical model for an eccentric quasi-axisymmetric shearing box which generalises the often-used cartesian shearing box model. The numerical method is an overall second order well-balanced finite volume method which maintains the stratified and oscillatory steady-state solution by construction. This implementation is employed to study the non-linear outcome of the parametric instability in eccentric discs with vertical structure. Stratification is found to constrain the perturbation energy near the mid-plane and localise the effective region of inertial wave breaking that sources turbulence. A saturated marginally sonic turbulent state results from the non-linear breaking of inertial waves and is subsequently unstable to large-scale axisymmetric zonal flow structures. This resulting limit-cycle behaviour reduces access to the eccentric energy source and prevents substantial transport of angular momentum radially through the disc. Still, the saturation of this parametric instability of inertial waves is shown to damp eccentricity on a time-scale of a thousand orbital periods. It may thus be a promising mechanism for intermittently regaining balance with the exponential growth of eccentricity from the eccentric Lindblad resonances and may also help explain the occurrence of ""bursty"" dynamics such as the superhump phenomenon.",0

We employ the scattering-matrix approach to calculate the electronic two-terminal conductance through the ring and investigate how it is affected by Dirac-electron interference. The interplay of pseudospin chirality and hard-wall confinement is found to distinctly affect the geometric phase that is experimentally accessible in mesoscopic-conductance measurements. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for the azimuthal motion of charge carriers in the ring that yields deeper insight into the physical origin of the observed transport effects, including the unique behavior exhibited by the lowest ring subband in the normal and topological (i.e., band-inverted) regimes.

76353,1,"Spin-orbit coupling and surface magnetism coexisting in spin-dependent low-energy He+ -ion surface scattering Surface magnetism is analyzed by spin-dependent He+-ion neutralization (the Auger neutralization) in the vicinity of a surface using an electron spin-polarized low-energy He+-ion beam [spin-polarized ion scattering spectroscopy (SP-ISS)]. Recently, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been found to act as another mechanism of spin-dependent low-energy He+-ion scattering. Thus, it is crucial for surface magnetism analyses by SP-ISS to separate those two mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the spin-induced asymmetry in scattering of low-energy He+ ions on ultrathin Au and Sn films as well as the oxygen adsorbate on a magnetized-Fe(100) surface where these two mechanisms may coexist. We found that the Fe surface magnetism immediately disappeared with the growth of those overlayers. On the other hand, we observed no induced spin polarization in the Au and Sn thin films even in the very initial stage of the growth. We also observed that the spin asymmetry of the O adsorbate was induced by the magnetism of the underlying Fe substrate. The present study demonstrates that the two mechanisms of the spin-asymmetric He+-ion scattering (the ion neutralization and SOC) can be separated by an azimuthal-angle-resolved SP-ISS measurement.",0

We also derive the alternative kinematic estimator S0.5, with a best-fit relation logS0.5 =(2.06 +/- 0.032)+(0.211 +/- 0.086)(logM/Msun - 10), and infer an evolution of Delta M/Msun= -0.45 +/- 0.13 dex compared to z < 1.2 if we adopt a fixed slope. We investigate and review various systematics, ranging from PSF effects, projection effects, systematics related to stellar mass derivation, selection biases and slope. We find that discrepancies between the various literature values are reduced when taking these into account. Our observations correspond well with the gradual evolution predicted by semi-analytic models.",0
77322,1,"Canonical Quantization, Quasi-Hermiticity, Observables and the Construction of Complete Basis Sets We consider the problem of designing a variety of ""system guided"" basis sets for quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillators. Using ideas based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we design canonical transformations of the usual position and momentum to generate generalized ""Cartesian-like positions, W and momenta, p_W"" with unit Poisson brackets. These are quantized following Dirac, leading to an infinite family of potential ""operator observables"". The fundamental issue is that all but one of the operators are not Hermitian (formally self-adjoint) in the original position representation. We show that the resulting operators are ""quasi-Hermitian"" relative to the x-representation and that all are Hermitian in the W-representation. Depending on how one treats the Jacobian of the canonical transformation in the expression for the classical momentum, p_W, quantization yields a) continuous mutually unbiased bases (MUB) b) orthogonal bases (with Dirac delta normalization) c) biorthogonal bases (with Dirac delta normalization) d) new W-harmonic oscillators yielding standard orthonormal bases (as functions of W) and associated coherent states. The MUB include W-generalized Fourier transform kernels whose eigenvectors are the W-harmonic oscillator eigenstates, with the spectrum (p/m i, p/m i). The W, p_W satisfy the uncertainty product relation: Delta-W * Delta-p_W gte 1/2.",0

We prove that the set of such polyhedra in fact fills out the configuration space of a particularly well-behaved family of generalized permutohedra, the zonotopal generalized permutohedra, that are obtained as the Minkowski sums of line segments parallel to the root directions $e_i-e_j$.",0
77361,1,"Many-body renormalization of Landau levels in graphene due to screened Coulomb interaction Renormalization of Landau level energies in graphene in strong magnetic field due to Coulomb interaction is studied theoretically, and calculations are compared with two experiments on carrier-density dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy. An approximate preservation of the square-root dependence of the energies of Landau levels on their numbers and magnetic field in the presence of the interaction is examined. Many-body calculations of the renormalized Fermi velocity with the statically screened interaction taken in the random-phase approximation show good agreement with both experiments. The crucial role of the screening in achieving quantitative agreement is found. The main contribution to the observed rapid logarithmic growth of the renormalized Fermi velocity on approach to the charge neutrality point turned out to be caused not by mere exchange interaction effects, but by weakening of the screening at decreasing carrier density. The importance of a self-consistent treatment of the screening is also demonstrated.",0
77441,1,"$SU(3)$ Topological Insulators in the Honeycomb Lattice We investigate realizations of topological insulators with spin-1 bosons loaded in a honeycomb optical lattice and subjected to a $SU(3)$ spin-orbit coupling - a situation which can be realized experimentally using cold atomic gases. In this paper, we focus on the topological properties of the single-particle band structure, namely Chern numbers (lattice with periodic boundary conditions) and edge states (lattice with strip geometry). While $SU(2)$ spin-orbit couplings always lead to time-reversal symmetric Hubbard models, and thereby to topologically trivial band structures, suitable $SU(3)$ spin-orbit couplings can break time reversal symmetry and lead to topologically non-trivial bulk band structures and to edge states in the strip geometry. In addition, we show that one can trigger a series of topological transitions (i.e. integer changes of the Chern numbers) that are specific to the geometry of the honeycomb lattice by varying a single parameter in the Hamiltonian.",0
77567,1,"Z2Pack: Numerical Implementation of Hybrid Wannier Centers for Identifying Topological Materials The intense theoretical and experimental interest in topological insulators and semimetals has established band structure topology as a fundamental material property. Consequently, identifying band topologies has become an important, but often challenging, problem, with no exhaustive solution at the present time. In this work we compile a series of techniques, some previously known, that allow for a solution to this problem for a large set of the possible band topologies. The method is based on tracking hybrid Wannier charge centers computed for relevant Bloch states, and it works at all levels of materials modeling: continuous k·p models, tight-binding models, and ab initio calculations. We apply the method to compute and identify Chern, Z2, and crystalline topological insulators, as well as topological semimetal phases, using real material examples. Moreover, we provide a numerical implementation of this technique (the Z2Pack software package) that is ideally suited for high-throughput screening of materials databases for compounds with nontrivial topologies. We expect that our work will allow researchers to (a) identify topological materials optimal for experimental probes, (b) classify existing compounds, and (c) reveal materials that host novel, not yet described, topological states.",0
77609,1,"The role of low-volatility organic compounds in initial particle growth in the atmosphere About half of present-day cloud condensation nuclei originate from atmospheric nucleation, frequently appearing as a burst of new particles near midday1. Atmospheric observations show that the growth rate of new particles often accelerates when the diameter of the particles is between one and ten nanometres2, 3. In this critical size range, new particles are most likely to be lost by coagulation with pre-existing particles4, thereby failing to form new cloud condensation nuclei that are typically 50 to 100 nanometres across. Sulfuric acid vapour is often involved in nucleation but is too scarce to explain most subsequent growth5, 6, leaving organic vapours as the most plausible alternative, at least in the planetary boundary layer7, 8, 9, 10. Although recent studies11, 12, 13 predict that low-volatility organic vapours contribute during initial growth, direct evidence has been lacking. The accelerating growth may result from increased photolytic production of condensable organic species in the afternoon2, and the presence of a possible Kelvin (curvature) effect, which inhibits organic vapour condensation on the smallest particles (the nano-Köhler theory)2, 14, has so far remained ambiguous. Here we present experiments performed in a large chamber under atmospheric conditions that investigate the role of organic vapours in the initial growth of nucleated organic particles in the absence of inorganic acids and bases such as sulfuric acid or ammonia and amines, respectively. Using data from the same set of experiments, it has been shown15 that organic vapours alone can drive nucleation. We focus on the growth of nucleated particles and find that the organic vapours that drive initial growth have extremely low volatilities (saturation concentration less than 10−4.5 micrograms per cubic metre). As the particles increase in size and the Kelvin barrier falls, subsequent growth is primarily due to more abundant organic vapours of slightly higher volatility (saturation concentrations of 10−4.5 to 10−0.5 micrograms per cubic metre). We present a particle growth model that quantitatively reproduces our measurements. Furthermore, we implement a parameterization of the first steps of growth in a global aerosol model and find that concentrations of atmospheric cloud concentration nuclei can change substantially in response, that is, by up to 50 per cent in comparison with previously assumed growth rate parameterizations.",0

77808,1,"Fundamental precision limit of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric sensor when one of the inputs is the vacuum In the lore of quantum metrology, one often hears (or reads) the following no-go theorem: If you put a vacuum into one input port of a balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, then no matter what you put into the other input port, and no matter what your detection scheme, the sensitivity can never be better than the shot-noise limit (SNL). Often the proof of this theorem is cited to be in C. Caves, Phys. Rev. D 23, 1693 (1981)0556-282110.1103/PhysRevD.23.1693, but upon further inspection, no such claim is made there. Quantum-Fisher-information-based arguments suggestive of this no-go theorem appear elsewhere in the literature, but are not stated in their full generality. Here we thoroughly explore this no-go theorem and give a rigorous statement: the no-go theorem holds whenever the unknown phase shift is split between both of the arms of the interferometer, but remarkably does not hold when only one arm has the unknown phase shift. In the latter scenario, we provide an explicit measurement strategy that beats the SNL. We also point out that these two scenarios are physically different and correspond to different types of sensing applications.",0

In the 1D numerical simulation, the asymptotic degenerate equation of state and simplified one-step reaction rates for nuclear reactions are used to study the flame propagation and pulsation in white dwarfs. The numerical critical Zel'dovich numbers of planar flames at different densities ($\rho=2$, 3 and 4$\times 10^7$~g/cm$^3$) and of spherical flames (with curvature $c=$-0.01, 0, 0.01 and 0.05) at a particular density ($\rho=2\times 10^7$~g/cm$^3$) are presented.

While being stable at higher temperatures, at relatively lower temperatures the amplitude of the flame pulsation becomes larger. In outwardly propagating spherical flames the pulsation instability is enhanced and flames are also easier to quench due to pulsation at small radius, while the inwardly propagating flames are more stable.",0
78194,1,"K2 Discovers a Busy Bee: An Unusual Transiting Neptune Found in the Beehive Cluster Open clusters have been the focus of several exoplanet surveys but only a few planets have so far been discovered. The \emph{Kepler} spacecraft revealed an abundance of small planets around small, cool stars, therefore, such cluster members are prime targets for exoplanet transit searches. Kepler's new mission, K2, is targeting several open clusters and star-forming regions around the ecliptic to search for transiting planets around their low-mass constituents. Here, we report the discovery of the first transiting planet in the intermediate-age (800 Myr) Beehive cluster (Praesepe). K2-95 is a faint ($\mathrm{Kp = 15.5\,mag}$) $\mathrm{M3.0\pm0.5}$ dwarf from K2's Campaign 5 with an effective temperature of $\mathrm{3471 \pm 124\,K}$, approximately solar metallicity and a radius of $\mathrm{0.402 \pm 0.050 \,R_\odot}$. We detected a transiting planet with a radius of $\mathrm{3.47^{+0.78}_{-0.53} \, R_\oplus}$ and an orbital period of 10.134 days. We combined photometry, medium/high-resolution spectroscopy, adaptive optics/speckle imaging and archival survey images to rule out any false positive detection scenarios, validate the planet, and further characterize the system. The planet's radius is very unusual as M-dwarf field stars rarely have Neptune-sized transiting planets. The comparatively large radius of K2-95b is consistent with the other recently discovered cluster planets K2-25b (Hyades) and K2-33b (Upper Scorpius), indicating systematic differences in their evolutionary states or formation. These discoveries from K2 provide a snapshot of planet formation and evolution in cluster environments and thus make excellent laboratories to test differences between field-star and cluster planet populations.",0

Using methods of asymptotic estimates, the inverse problem for the spectral data of such Cauchy data is answered. Finally a Jacobi variety for the spectral curve is constructed, and this is used to study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral data corresponding to actual simply periodic solutions of the sinh-Gordon equation on strips of positive height.",0
78477,1,"Spontaneous and Stimulated Radiative emission of Modulated Free-Electron Quantum wavepackets - Semiclassical Analysis Here we present a semiclassical analysis of spontaneous and stimulated radiative emission from unmodulated and optically-modulated electron quantum wavepackets. We show that the radiative emission/absorption and corresponding deceleration/acceleration of the wavepackets depend on the controllable 'history-dependent' wavepacket size. The characteristics of the radiative interaction when a wavepacket of size (duration) is short relative to the radiation wavelength, are close to the predictions of the classical point-particle modeling. On the other hand, in the long-sized wavepacket limit, the interaction is quantum-mechanical, and it diminishes exponentially at high frequency. We exemplify these effects through the scheme of Smith-Purcell radiation, and demonstrate that if the wavepacket is optically-modulated and periodically-bunched, it exhibits finite radiative emission at harmonics of the modulation frequency beyond the limit of high-frequency cutoff. Besides, the radiation analysis is further extended to the cases of superradiant emission from a beam of phase-correlated modulated electron wavepackets. This wavepacket-dependent emission process shows the radiative features of classical-to-quantum transition, indicates a way for measuring the quantum electron wavepacket size and suggests a new direction for exploring light-matter interaction.",0
78525,1,"Supersymmetric Transformations in Optical Fibers Supersymmetry (SUSY) has recently emerged as a tool to design unique optical structures with degenerate spectra. Here, we study several fundamental aspects and variants of one-dimensional SUSY in axially symmetric optical media, including their basic spectral features and the conditions for degeneracy breaking. Surprisingly, we find that the SUSY degeneracy theorem is partially (totally) violated in optical systems connected by isospectral (broken) SUSY transformations due to a degradation of the paraxial approximation. In addition, we show that isospectral constructions provide a dimension-independent design control over the group delay in SUSY fibers. Moreover, we find that the studied unbroken and isospectral SUSY transformations allow us to generate refractive-index superpartners with an extremely large phase-matching bandwidth spanning the S+C+L optical bands. These singular features define a class of optical fibers with a number of potential applications. To illustrate this, we numerically demonstrate the possibility of building photonic lanterns supporting broadband heterogeneous supermodes with large effective area, a broadband all-fiber true-mode (de)multiplexer requiring no mode conversion, and different mode-filtering, mode-conversion, and pulse-shaping devices. Finally, we discuss the possibility of extrapolating our results to acoustics and quantum mechanics.",0

78985,1,"Suppression of Parallel Transport in Turbulent Magnetized Plasmas and its Impact on the Non-thermal and Thermal Aspects of Solar Flares The transport of the energy contained in electrons, both thermal and suprathermal, in solar flares plays a key role in our understanding of many aspects of the flare phenomenon, from the spatial distribution of hard X-ray emission to global energetics. Motivated by recent RHESSI observations that point to the existence of a mechanism that confines electrons to the coronal parts of flare loops more effectively than Coulomb collisions, we here consider the impact of pitch-angle scattering off turbulent magnetic fluctuations on the parallel transport of electrons in flaring coronal loops. It is shown that the presence of such a scattering mechanism in addition to Coulomb collisional scattering can significantly reduce the parallel thermal and electrical conductivities relative to their collisional values. We provide illustrative expressions for the resulting thermoelectric coefficients that relate the thermal flux and electrical current density to the temperature gradient and the applied electric field. We then evaluate the effect of these modified transport coefficients on the flare coronal temperature that can be attained, on the post-impulsive-phase cooling of heated coronal plasma, and on the importance of the beam-neutralizing return current on both ambient heating and the energy loss rate of accelerated electrons. We also discuss the possible ways in which anomalous transport processes have an impact on the required overall energy associated with accelerated electrons in solar flares.",0

79032,1,"Electromagnetic Lagrangian on a causal set that resides on edges rather than points The goal of this paper is to introduce one of the versions of the electromagnetic Lagrangian on a causal set in such a way that would address the non-locality issues inherent to causal set theory. The key idea is that Lagrangian density is assigned to the edges rather than points, and there is a way of defining the concept of ""neighboring edges"" of a given edge in such a way that each edge has only finitely many neighboring edges which would ultimately allow for the theory to be local. That is to be contrasted with points where every point has infinitely many direct neighbors which is a source of non-locality. The edges are needed in order to define electromagnetic Lagrangian anyway, regardless of the consideration of locality; the novelty of this paper is to assign Lagrangian density to the edges as well. Also, in the other papers edges were both spacelike and timelike, while in this paper they are only timelike. This makes calculations considerably more complicated, but it is crucial in preserving locality since the Lorentz group in a hyperplane perpendicular to the edge is compact only if the edge is timelike.",0

The density of clumps differs by a factor of $\sim 3$ from the azimuthal average, the magnitude of their velocity dispersion is comparable to the flow velocity and they produce $\sim 20\%$ variations in the column density.

The influence of this correlation length on the dynamics of the KPZ equation is analyzed. It is found that its large-scale behavior is controlled by the ""standard"" KPZ fixed point, i.e. in this limit the KPZ system forced by ""sinc""-noise with arbitrarily large but finite correlation length $\xi$ behaves as if it were excited with pure white noise. A similar result has been found by Mathey et al. [Phys.Rev.E 95, 032117] in 2017 for a spatial noise correlation of Gaussian type ($\sim e^{-x^2/(2\xi^2)}$), using a different method.

79488,1,"Linked by dynamics: wavelet--based mutual information rate as a connectivity measure and scale-specific networks Experimentally observed networks of interacting dynamical systems are inferred from recorded multivariate time series by evaluating a statistical measure of dependence, usually the cross-correlation coefficient, or mutual information. These measures reflect dependence in static probability distributions, generated by systems' evolution, rather than coherence of systems' dynamics. Moreover, these ""static"" measures of dependence can be biased due to properties of dynamics underlying the analyzed time series. Consequently, properties of local dynamics can be misinterpreted as properties of connectivity or long-range interactions. We propose the mutual information rate as a measure reflecting coherence or synchronization of dynamics of two systems and not suffering by the bias typical for the ""static"" measures. We demonstrate that a computationally accessible estimation method, derived for Gaussian processes and adapted by using the wavelet transform, can be effective for nonlinear, nonstationary and multiscale processes. The discussed problem and the proposed method are illustrated using numerically generated data of coupled dynamical systems as well as gridded reanalysis data of surface air temperature as the source for the construction of climate networks. In particular, scale-specific climate networks are introduced.",0

PIV and hot-wire measurements give quantitative information on the flow. It is shown that the flow exits the pipe as a swirling annulus with a rotation corresponding to the frequency of the sound, and that the center of the swirl follows a nearly circular path in the exit plane.

We demonstrate that the deposition of SEPs is non-uniform at the planetary surface, and that the corresponding energy flux is lower than other sources postulated to have influenced the origin of life. Nevertheless, SEPs may have been capable of facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of vital organic molecules (e.g., nucleobases and amino acids). Owing to the relatively high efficiency of these pathways, the overall yields might be comparable to (or even exceed) the values predicted for some conventional sources such as electrical discharges and exogenous delivery by meteorites. We also suggest that SEPs could have played a role in enabling the initiation of lightning. A notable corollary of our work is that SEPs may constitute an important mechanism for prebiotic synthesis on exoplanets around M-dwarfs, thereby mitigating the deficiency of biologically active ultraviolet radiation on these planets. Although there are several uncertainties associated with (exo)planetary environments and prebiotic chemical pathways, our study illustrates that SEPs represent a potentially important factor in understanding the origin of life.",0

80221,1,"FUV line emission, gas kinematics, and discovery of [Fe XXI] $\lambda$1354.1 in the sightline towards a filament in M87 We present new HST/COS G130M spectroscopy which we have obtained for a sightline towards a filament projected 1.9 kpc from the nucleus of M87. We propose that the filament is composed of many cold clumps, each surrounded by an FUV-emitting boundary layer, with the filament having a radius $r_c \sim 10$ pc and the clumps filling the cylinder with a low volume filling factor. The observed velocity dispersion in emission lines from the filament results from the random motions of these clumps within the filament. We measure fluxes and kinematics for emission lines of Ly$\alpha$, C II $\lambda$1335, and N V $\lambda1238$. We associate these latter three lines, as well as archival measurements of H$\alpha$, C IV $\lambda$1549, and He II $\lambda$1640, with a multitemperature boundary layer around clumps which are moving with supersonic random motions in the filament. This boundary layer is a significant coolant of the hot gas. We show that the [C II] $\lambda$158$\mu$m flux observed by Herschel/PACS from this region implies the existence of a massive cold ($T \sim 10^3$ K) component in the filament which contains significantly more mass than the FUV-emitting boundary layer. It has about the same bulk velocity and velocity dispersion as the boundary layer. We also detect [Fe XXI] $\lambda$1354 in emission at $4.1-5.1\sigma$. This line is emitted from 1 keV ($T \approx 10^7$ K) plasma, and we use it to measure the bulk radial velocity and velocity dispersion of the plasma at this temperature. In contrast to the intermediate-temperature FUV lines, [Fe XXI] is blueshifted relative to M87 and matches the bulk velocity of a nearby filament to the S.

Indeed, by exploiting the nonlinear properties of the condensate, a small asymmetry can stabilize the system even further due to a self-regulation of the particle number.",0
80357,1,"How We Make Sense of the World: Information, Map-Making, and The Scientific Narrative Science is a constructed narrative of the natural world based on information gathering and its subsequent analysis. In this essay, we develop a novel approach to the epistemic foundations of the scientific narrative, as based on our experiential interactions with the natural world. We first review some of the basic aspects of both Bayesian statistics and Shannon's information theory as applied to the construction of meaningful conceptualization of the natural world. This conceptualization is rendered through the maps we construct of the world based on our limited knowledge of reality. We propose a path from experience to information and physics based on the notion that information is experience that induces change in an Epistemic Agent (EA): the change may be local and focused to a minor aspect of reality or it may be broad and worldview-changing. We illustrate our approach through an analysis of a measure of spatial complexity proposed by one of us called Configuration Entropy (CE), and establish a link between experience at the cognitive level and information content, showing that the CE is a quantitative measure of how much information in spatial-complexity the external world hides from an EA.",0
80395,1,"Spatially resolved cold molecular outflows in ULIRGs We present new CO(2-1) observations of 3 low-z (~350 Mpc) ULIRG systems (6 nuclei) observed with ALMA at high-spatial resolution (~500 pc). We detect massive cold molecular gas outflows in 5 out of 6 nuclei (0.3-5)x10^8 Msun. These outflows are spatially resolved with deprojected radii of 0.25-1 kpc although high-velocity molecular gas is detected up to ~0.5-1.8 kpc (1-6 kpc deprojected). The mass outflow rates are 12-400 Msun/yr and the inclination corrected average velocity of the outflowing gas 350-550 km/s (v_max = 500-900 km/s). The origin of these outflows can be explained by the nuclear starbursts although the contribution of an obscured AGN can not be completely ruled out. The position angle (PA) of the outflowing gas along the kinematic minor axis of the nuclear molecular disk suggests that the outflow axis is perpendicular to the disk for three of these outflows. Only in one case, the outflow PA is clearly not along the kinematic minor axis. The outflow depletion times are 15-80 Myr which are slightly shorter than the star-formation (SF) depletion times (30-80 Myr). However, we estimate that only 15-30% of the outflowing gas will escape the gravitational potential of the nucleus. The majority of the outflowing gas will return to the disk after 5-10 Myr and become available to form new stars. Therefore, these outflows will not likely quench the nuclear starbursts. These outflows would be consistent with being driven by radiation pressure (momentum-driven) only if the coupling between radiation and dust increases with increasing SF rates. This can be achieved if the dust optical depth is higher in objects with higher SF. The relatively small sizes (<1 kpc) and dynamical times (<3 Myr) of the cold molecular outflows suggests that molecular gas cannot survive longer in the outflow environment or that it cannot form efficiently beyond these distances or times.

80639,1,"Quantum Wigner molecules in semiconductor quantum dots and cold-atom optical traps and their mathematical symmetries Strong repelling interactions between a few fermions or bosons confined in two-dimensional circular traps lead to particle localization and formation of quantum Wigner molecules (QWMs) possessing definite point-group space symmetries. These point-group symmetries are ""hidden"" (or emergent), namely they cannot be traced in the circular single-particle densities (SPDs) associated with the exact many-body wave functions, but they are manifested as characteristic signatures in the ro-vibrational spectra. An example, among many, are the few-body QWM states under a high magnetic field or at fast rotation, which are precursor states for the fractional quantum Hall effect. The hidden geometric symmetries can be directly revealed by using spin-resolved conditional probability distributions, which are extracted from configuration-interaction (CI), exact-diagonalization wave functions. The hidden symmetries can also be revealed in the CI SPDs by reducing the symmetry of the trap (from circular to elliptic to quasi-linear). In addition the hidden symmetries are directly connected to the explicitly broken-symmetry (BS) solutions of mean-field approaches, such as unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF). A companion step of restoration of the broken symmetries via projection operators applied on the BS-UHF solutions produces wave functions directly comparable to the CI ones, and sheds further light into the role played by the emergence of hidden symmetries in the exact many-body wave functions. Illustrative examples of the importance of hidden symmetries in the many-body problem of few electrons in semiconductor quantum dots and of few ultracold atoms in optical traps (where unprecedented control of the interparticle interaction has been experimentally achieved recently) will be presented.",0

The research questions addressed how labels with leading questions/metaphors and relevance to everyday life affect comprehension of the intended message for deep space images, the desire to learn more, and the aesthetic appreciation of images. Participants were a convenience sample of 1,921 respondents solicited from a variety of websites and through social media who completed an online survey that used four high-resolution images as stimuli: Sagittarius A*, Solar Flare, Cassiopeia A, and the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101). Participants were randomly assigned initially to 1 of 3 label conditions: the standard label originally written for the image, a label with a leading question containing a metaphor related to the information for the image, or a label that contained a fact about the image relevant to everyday life. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 image and compared all labels for that image. Open-ended items at various points asked participants to pose questions to a hypothetical astronomer. Main findings were that the relevance condition was significantly more likely to increase wanting to learn more; the original label was most likely to increase overall appreciation; and, smart phone users were more likely to want to learn more and report increased levels of appreciation. Results are discussed in terms of the need to examine individual viewer characteristics and goals in creating different labels for different audiences.",0
80676,1,"Imaging of interlayer coupling in van der Waals heterostructures using a bright-field optical microscope Vertically stacked atomic layers from different layered crystals can be held together by van der Waals forces, which can be used for building novel heterostructures, offering a platform for developing a new generation of atomically thin, transparent and flexible devices. The performance of these devices is critically dependent on the layer thickness and the interlayer electronic coupling, influencing the hybridisation of the electronic states as well as charge and energy transfer between the layers. The electronic coupling is affected by the relative orientation of the layers as well as by the cleanliness of their interfaces. Here, we demonstrate an efficient method for monitoring interlayer coupling in heterostructures made from transition metal dichalcogenides using photoluminescence imaging in a bright-field optical microscope. The colour and brightness in such images are used here to identify mono- and few-layer crystals, and to track changes in the interlayer coupling and the emergence of interlayer excitons after thermal annealing in mechanically exfoliated flakes as well as a function of the twist angle in atomic layers grown by chemical vapour deposition. Material and crystal thickness sensitivity of the presented imaging technique makes it a powerful tool for characterisation of van der Waals heterostructures assembled by a wide variety of methods, using combinations of materials obtained through mechanical or chemical exfoliation and crystal growth.",0

80962,1,"2D surprises at the surface of 3D materials: Confined electron systems in transition metal oxides The scope of this article is to review the state-of-the-art in the field of confined electron systems generated at the bare surfaces of transition metal oxides (TMOs). This scientific field is a prime example of a domain where two-dimensional physics and photoemission-based spectroscopic techniques have together set up the development of the story. The discovery of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at interfaces of transition metal oxides has attracted an immense scientific interest due to new opportunities opened in the emerging field of oxide electronics. The subsequent paradigm shift from interfaces to the bare surfaces of TMOs made the confined electron system accessible to surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques and this new era is the focus of the present article. We describe how results by means of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) establish the presence of confined electron carriers at the bare surface of SrTiO3(100), which exhibit complex physics phenomena such as orbital ordering, electron–phonon interactions and spin splitting. The key element behind the 2DES generation is oxygen vacancies. Moreover, we review the experimental evidence on the generation of 2DESs on surfaces with different orientation, as well as on different TMO substrates. The electronic structure of the confined electron system responds to such changes, thereby providing external means for engineering its properties. Finally, we identify new directions for future research by introducing a device-friendly fabrication protocol for the generation of 2DESs on TMO surfaces.",0

The main novelty of this apparatus is that a transparent electrically conducting electrolyte is subject to extremely high magnetic fields (up to 10 T) to produce electromagnetic effects comparable to those produced by moderate magnetic fields in planetary cores. This technique makes it possible to visualise for the first time the coupling between the principal forces in a convection-driven dynamo by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in a geometry relevant to planets. We first present the technology that enables us to generate these forces and implement PIV in a high magnetic field environment.

81026,1,"Vibron properties in quasi 1D molecular structures: the case of two parallel unshifted macromolecuar chains We study the hopping mechanism of the vibron excitation transport in the system of two parallel unshifted 1D macromolecuar chains in the framework of non-adiabatic polaron theory. We suppose that the vibron interaction with thermal oscillations of the macromolecular structural elements will result in vibron self-trapping and the formation of the partial dressed vibron state. We also suppose that quasiparticle motion takes place via a sequence of random sitejumps, in each of which the quasiparticle can migrate either to the first neighbor site of the macromolecular chain. With use of the modified Holstein polaron model, we calculate the vibron effective mass in dependence of the basic system parameters and temperature. Special attention is paid to the influence of interchain coupling on vibron dressing. We find that for certain values of the system parameters the quasiparticle mass abruptly changes.",0
81242,1,"Defect energetics and magnetic properties of 3d-transition-metal-doped topological crystalline insulator SnTe The introduction of magnetism in SnTe-class topological crystalline insulators is a challenging subject with great importance in the quantum device applications. Based on the first-principles calculations, we have studied the defect energetics and magnetic properties of 3d transition-metal (TM)-doped SnTe. We find that the doped TM atoms prefer to stay in the neutral states and have comparatively high formation energies, suggesting that the uniform TMdoping in SnTe with a higher concentration will be difficult unless clustering. In the dilute doping regime, all the magnetic TMatoms are in the high-spin states, indicating that the spin splitting energy of 3d TM is stronger than the crystal splitting energy of the SnTe ligand. Importantly, Mn-doped SnTe has relatively low defect formation energy, largest local magnetic moment, and no defect levels in the bulk gap, suggesting that Mn is a promising magnetic dopant to realize the magnetic order for the theoretically-proposed large-Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in SnTe.",0
81261,1,"Local Measurements of the Mean Interstellar Polarization at High Galactic Latitudes We conduct a small-scale pathfinding survey designed to identify the average polarization properties of the diffuse ISM locally at the lowest dust content regions. We perform deep optopolarimetric surveys within three $\sim 15' \times 15'$ regions located at $b > 48^\circ$, using the RoboPol instrument. The observed samples of stars are photometrically complete to $\sim$16 mag in the R-band. The selected regions exhibit low dust emission at 353 GHz and low total reddening compared to the majority of high-latitude sightlines. We measure the level of systematic uncertainty for all observing epochs and find it to be 0.1\% in fractional linear polarization, $p$. The majority of individual stellar measurements are non-detections. However, our survey strategy enables us to locate the mean fractional linear polarization $p_{mean}$ in each of the three regions. The region with lowest dust content yields $p_{mean}=(0.054 \pm 0.038) \%$, not significantly different from zero. We find significant detections for the remaining two regions of: $p_{mean}=(0.113 \pm 0.036) \%$ and $p_{mean}=(0.208 \pm 0.044) \%$. Using a Bayesian approach we provide upper limits on the intrinsic spread of the small-scale distributions of $q$ and $u$. At the detected $p_{mean}$ levels, the determination of the systematic uncertainty is critical for the reliability of the measurements. We verify the significance of our detections with statistical tests, accounting for all sources of uncertainty. Using publicly available HI emission data, we identify the velocity components that most likely account for the observed $p_{mean}$ and find their morphologies to be misaligned with the orientation of the mean plane-of-sky magnetic field at a spatial resolution of 10$\arcmin$. We find indications that the standard upper envelope of $p$ with reddening underestimates the maximum $p$ at very low E(B-V) ($\leq 0.01$ mag).",0

81317,1,"Experimental verification of genuine multipartite entanglement without shared reference frames Quantum entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information processing, either for quantum communication or for quantum computation. The multipartite case of entanglement, especially the so called genuine multipartite entanglement, has significant importance for multipartite quantum information protocols. Thus, it is a natural requirement to experimentally verify multipartite quantum entanglement when performing many quantum information tasks. However, this is often technically challenging due to the difficulty of building a shared reference frame among all involved parties, especially when these parties are distant from each other. In this paper, we experimentally verify the genuine tripartite entanglement of a three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state without shared reference frames. A high probability 0.79 of successfully verifying the genuine tripartite entanglement is achieved when no reference frame is shared. In the case of sharing only one common axis, an even higher success probability of 0.91 is achieved.",0

81358,1,"Inflationary quasiparticle creation and thermalization dynamics in coupled Bose-Einstein condensates A Bose gas in a double-well potential, exhibiting a true Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) amplitude and initially performing Josephson oscillations, is a prototype of an isolated, non-equilibrium many-body system. We investigate the quasiparticle (QP) creation and thermalization dynamics of this system by solving the time-dependent Keldysh-Bogoliubov equations. We find avalanche-like QP creation due to a parametric resonance between BEC and QP oscillations, followed by slow, exponential relaxation to a thermal state at an elevated temperature, controlled by the initial excitation energy of the oscillating BEC above its ground state. The crossover between the two regimes occurs because of an effective decoupling of the QP and BEC oscillations. This dynamics is analogous to elementary particle creation in models of the early universe. The thermalization in our set-up occurs because the BEC acts as a grand canonical reservoir for the quasiparticle system.",0

More precisely, we construct a faithful functor from the category of Lie algebroids to the category of $L_\infty$ spaces. Then we show that for each Lie algebroid $L$, there is a fully faithful functor from the category of representations up to homotopy of $L$ to the category of vector bundles over the associated $L_\infty$ space. Indeed, this functor sends the adjoint complex of $L$ to the tangent bundle of the $L_\infty$ space. Finally, we show that a shifted-symplectic structure on a dg Lie algebroid $L$ produces a shifted-symplectic structure on the associated $L_\infty$ space.",0
81650,1,"Crossover from impurity-controlled to granular superconductivity in ${(\mathbf{TMTSF})}_{2}{\mathbf{ClO}}_{4}$ Using a proper cooling procedure, a controllable amount of nonmagnetic structural disorder can be introduced at low temperature in ( TMTSF ) 2 ClO 4 . Here we performed simultaneous measurements of transport and magnetic properties of ( TMTSF ) 2 ClO 4 in its normal and superconducting states, while finely covering three orders of magnitude of the cooling rate around the anion ordering temperature. Our result reveals, with increasing density of disorder, the existence of a crossover between homogeneous defect-controlled d -wave superconductivity and granular superconductivity. At slow cooling rates, with small amount of disorder, the evolution of superconducting properties is well described with the Abrikosov-Gorkov theory, providing further confirmation of non- s -wave pairing in this compound. In contrast, at fast cooling rates, zero resistance and diamagnetic shielding are achieved through a randomly distributed network of superconducting puddles embedded in a normal conducting background and interconnected by proximity effect coupling. The temperature dependence of the ac complex susceptibility reveals features typical for a network of granular superconductors. This makes ( TMTSF ) 2 ClO 4 a model system for granular superconductivity where the grain size and their concentration are tunable within the same sample.",0
81651,1,"Stellar and AGN feedback in isolated early-type galaxies: the role in regulating star formation and ISM properties Understanding how galaxies maintain the inefficiency of star formation with physically self-consistent models is a central problem for galaxy evolution. Although numerous theoretical models by invoking different feedback processes have been proposed in recent decades, the debate still exists. By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we study the three feedback (stellar wind heating, SNe feedback, and AGN feedback) effects in suppressing star formation activities on the cosmological evolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses. The availability of gas sources for star formation comes exclusively from the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models. We find that SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low mass galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass elliptical galaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently offset the radiative cooling and thus plays a dominate role in regulating the star formation activities. Such a suppression of star formation is extremely efficient in the inner region of the galaxies. As expected, AGB heating cannot balance the cooling losses in the whole galaxies and hence cannot account for the suppression for both cases. The hot plasma X-ray temperature $T_{\rm X}$ can be in agreement with the observed data with the inclusion of effective feedback processes. We further find that X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ for the hot gas in our effective feedback models is consistent with the observed values. These results thus suggest that we can use $T_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm X}$ to probe the role of different feedback processes. The inclusion of additional gas sources can make the mass scale between SNe and AGN feedback dominating in suppressing star formation decrease to an observationally inferred value of a few $10^{10}~M_{\odot}$.",0
81663,1,"Fabrication of polarization-independent waveguides deeply buried in crystal using aberration-corrected femtosecond laser direct writing Writing optical waveguides with femtosecond laser pulses provides the capability of forming three-dimensional photonic circuits for manipulating light fields in both linear and nonlinear manners. To fully explore this potential, large depths of the buried waveguides in transparent substrates are often desirable to facilitate achieving vertical integration of waveguides in a multi-layer configuration, which, however, is hampered by rapidly degraded axial resolution caused by optical aberration. Here, we show that with the correction of the spherical aberration, polarization-independent waveguides can be inscribed in a nonlinear optical crystal lithium niobate (LN) at depths up to 1.4 mm, which is more than one order of magnitude deeper than the waveguides written with aberration uncorrected femtosecond laser pulses.

81747,1,"Differential pattern of HIF-1α expression in HNSCC cancer stem cells after carbon ion or photon irradiation: one molecular explanation of the oxygen effect Background:  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are resistant to standard treatments, partly due to cancer stem cells (CSCs) localised in hypoxic niches. Compared to X-rays, carbon ion irradiation relies on better ballistic properties, higher relative biological effectiveness and the absence of oxygen effect. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is involved in the resistance to photons, whereas its role in response to carbon ions remains unclear.  Methods:  Two HNSCC cell lines and their CSC sub-population were studied in response to photons or carbon ion irradiation, in normoxia or hypoxia, after inhibition or not of HIF-1α.  Results:  Under hypoxia, compared to non-CSCs, HIF-1α is expressed earlier in CSCs. A combined effect photons/hypoxia, less observed with carbon ions, results in a synergic and earlier HIF-1α expression in both subpopulations. The diffuse ROS production by photons is concomitant with HIF-1α expression and essential to its activation. There is no oxygen effect in response to carbon ions and the ROS localised in the track might be insufficient to stabilise HIF-1α. Finally, in hypoxia, cells were sensitised to both types of radiations after HIF-1α inhibition.  Conclusions:  Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α plays a main role in the response of CSCs and non-CSCs to carbon ion and photon irradiations, which makes the HIF-1α targeting an attractive therapeutic challenge.",0
81885,1,"Exploring Halo Substructure with Giant Stars. XV. Discovery of a Connection between the Monoceros Ring and the Triangulum-Andromeda Overdensity? Thanks to modern sky surveys, over twenty stellar streams and overdensity structures have been discovered in the halo of the Milky Way. In this paper, we present an analysis of spectroscopic observations of individual stars from one such structure, ""A13"", first identified as an overdensity using the M giant catalog from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. Our spectroscopic observations show that stars identified with A13 have a velocity dispersion of $\lesssim$ 40 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, implying that it is a genuine coherent structure rather than a chance super-position of random halo stars. From its position on the sky, distance ($\sim$15~kpc heliocentric), and kinematical properties, A13 is likely to be an extension of another low Galactic latitude substructure -- the Galactic Anticenter Stellar Structure (also known as the Monoceros Ring) -- towards smaller Galactic longitude and farther distance. Furthermore, the kinematics of A13 also connect it with another structure in the southern Galactic hemisphere -- the Triangulum-Andromeda overdensity. We discuss these three connected structures within the context of a previously proposed scenario that one or all of these features originate from the disk of the Milky Way.",0
82063,1,"Approximate and integrate: Variance reduction in Monte Carlo integration via function approximation Classical algorithms in numerical analysis for numerical integration (quadrature/cubature) follow the principle of approximate and integrate: the integrand is approximated by a simple function (e.g. a polynomial), which is then integrated exactly. In high-dimensional integration, such methods quickly become infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. A common alternative is the Monte Carlo method (MC), which simply takes the average of random samples, improving the estimate as more and more samples are taken. The main issue with MC is its slow (though dimension-independent) convergence, and various techniques have been proposed to reduce the variance. In this work we suggest a numerical analyst's interpretation of MC: it approximates the integrand with a constant function, and integrates that constant exactly. This observation leads naturally to MC-like methods where the approximant is a non-constant function, for example low-degree polynomials, sparse grids or low-rank functions. We show that these methods have the same $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ asymptotic convergence as in MC, but with reduced variance, equal to the quality of the underlying function approximation. We also discuss methods that improve the approximation quality as more samples are taken, and thus can converge faster than $O(1/\sqrt{N})$. The main message is that techniques in high-dimensional approximation theory can be combined with Monte Carlo integration to accelerate convergence.",0

82094,1,"Environment Identification in Flight using Sparse Approximation of Wing Strain This paper addresses the problem of identifying different flow environments from sparse data collected by wing strain sensors. Insects regularly perform this feat using a sparse ensemble of noisy strain sensors on their wing. First, we obtain strain data from numerical simulation of a Manduca sexta hawkmoth wing undergoing different flow environments. Our data-driven method learns low-dimensional strain features originating from different aerodynamic environments using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes in the frequency domain, and leverages sparse approximation to classify a set of strain frequency signatures using a dictionary of POD modes. This bio-inspired machine learning architecture for dictionary learning and sparse classification permits fewer costly physical strain sensors while being simultaneously robust to sensor noise. A measurement selection algorithm identifies frequencies that best discriminate the different aerodynamic environments in low-rank POD feature space. In this manner, sparse and noisy wing strain data can be exploited to robustly identify different aerodynamic environments encountered in flight, providing insight into the stereotyped placement of neurons that act as strain sensors on a Manduca sexta hawkmoth wing.",0
82099,1,"Nonmonotonic magnetoresistance of a two-dimensional viscous electron-hole fluid in a confined geometry Ultrapure conductors may exhibit hydrodynamic transport where the collective motion of charge carriers resembles the flow of a viscous fluid. In a confined geometry (e.g., in ultra-high-quality nanostructures), the electronic fluid assumes a Poiseuille-type flow. Applying an external magnetic field tends to diminish viscous effects leading to large negative magnetoresistance. In two-component systems near charge neutrality, the hydrodynamic flow of charge carriers is strongly affected by the mutual friction between the two constituents. At low fields, the magnetoresistance is negative, however, at high fields the interplay between electron-hole scattering, recombination, and viscosity results in a dramatic change of the flow profile: the magnetoresistance changes its sign and eventually becomes linear in very high fields. This nonmonotonic magnetoresistance can be used as a fingerprint to detect viscous flow in two-component conducting systems.",0
82104,1,"Electrometry by optical charge conversion of deep defects in 4H-SiC Optically-active point defects in various host materials, such as diamond and silicon carbide (SiC), have shown significant promise as local sensors of magnetic fields, electric fields, strain and temperature. Current sensing techniques take advantage of the relaxation and coherence times of the spin state within these defects. Here we show that the defect charge state can also be used to sense the environment, in particular high frequency (MHz-GHz) electric fields, complementing established spin-based techniques. This is enabled by optical charge conversion of the defects between their photoluminescent and dark charge states, with conversion rate dependent on the electric field (energy density). The technique provides an all-optical high frequency electrometer which is tested in 4H-SiC for both ensembles of divacancies and silicon vacancies, from cryogenic to room temperature, and with a measured sensitivity of ~41 (V/cm)**2 / $\sqrt{Hz}$. Finally, due to the piezoelectric character of SiC, we obtain spatial 3D maps of surface acoustic wave modes in a mechanical resonator.",0

We fix some general results, and by suitable counterexamples, we show that various pathologies can occur. This problem is also related to some recent results, of interest in physics, on closed formulas for the BCH series: while the sum of the BCH series presents several non-convergence issues, these closed formulas can provide a prolongation for the BCH series when it is not convergent.

82586,1,"Semiclassical catastrophe theory of simple bifurcations The Fedoriuk-Maslov catastrophe theory of caustics and turning points is extended to solve the bifurcation problems by the improved stationary phase method (ISPM). The trace formulas for the radial power-law (RPL) potentials are presented by the ISPM based on the second- and third-order expansion of the classical action near the stationary point. A considerable enhancement of contributions of the two orbits (pair consisting of the parent and newborn orbits) at their bifurcation is shown. The ISPM trace formula is proposed for a simple bifurcation scenario of Hamiltonian systems with continuous symmetries, where the contributions of the bifurcating parent orbits vanish upon approaching the bifurcation point due to the reduction of the end-point manifold. This occurs since the contribution of the parent orbits is included in the term corresponding to the family of the newborn daughter orbits. Taking this feature into account, the ISPM level densities calculated for the RPL potential model are shown to be in good agreement with the quantum results at the bifurcations and asymptotically far from the bifurcation points.",0
82636,1,"Van Vleck correction generalization for complex correlators with multilevel quantization Remote sensing with phased antenna arrays is based on measurement of the cross-correlations between the signals from each antenna pair. Digital correlators have systematic errors due to the quantization losses. The correlation errors allow substantial abatement based on the assumption that the analog signals are stochastic processes sampled from a statistical distribution (usually the Gaussian). The correlation correction technique is named after Van Vleck who was the first to apply it to two-level clipping quantizers. The correction is especially important for high correlation levels, e.g. in studies of solar radio emissions. We offer a generalized method that for every antenna pair inputs the quantized signals' covariance and standard deviations, and outputs high-precision estimates of the analog correlation. Although correlation correction methods have been extensively investigated in the past, there are several problems that, as far as we know, have not been published yet. We consider a very general quantization scheme with arbitrary set of transition thresholds and output levels, and our correction method is designed for correlations obtained from signals with generally unequal standard deviations. We also provide a method for estimation of the analog standard deviation from the quantized one for subsequent use in the correlation correction. We apply the correction to the the complex-valued analytic signals, overwhelmingly used in modern remote sensing systems with arrays of antennas. The approach is valid not only for analytic signals with the imaginary part being the Hilbert transform of the real one, but also for more general, circularly symmetric complex processes whose real and imaginary parts may have arbitrary relationships to each other. This work was motivated by the need for greater precision in analysis of data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).",0
82787,1,"Rescuing a Quantum Phase Transition with Quantum Noise We show that placing a quantum system in contact with an environment can enhance non-Fermi-liquid correlations, rather than destroy quantum effects, as is typical. The system consists of two quantum dots in series with two leads; the highly resistive leads couple charge flow through the dots to the electromagnetic environment, the source of quantum noise. While the charge transport inhibits a quantum phase transition, the quantum noise reduces charge transport and restores the transition. We find a non-Fermi-liquid intermediate fixed point for all strengths of the noise. For strong noise, it is similar to the intermediate fixed point of the two-impurity Kondo model.",0
82874,1,"Differential entropy in nonlinear dynamics complexity analysis Differential entropy, a nonlinear dynamics complexity measure, is proposed in our work. This chaos deterministic definition with flexible controlling parameter takes advantage of local nonlinear dynamical information among three adjacent elements to extract nonlinear complexity. In chaotic model complexity detecting tests, at the beginning chaotic stage and as chaotic behaviors increase of logistic map, DEn (differential entropy) with alpha from 0.33 to 0.38 has satisfied complexity extractions and shows advantages to PEn (permutation entropy) and JKSEn (J. Kurths symbolic entropy) which are also complexity measures based on local nonlinear dynamics. In real-world physiological heartbeats nonlinear complexity analysis, DEn values of three kinds of heart rates, the healthy young > the healthy elderly > CHF (congestive heart failure) patients, are significantly distinguished in statistics when alpha is 0.45 and 0.63. What's more, DEn does not have high requirement for data length and can effectively extract nonlinear complexity at short data length. DEn, therefore, is an efficient parameter characterizing nonlinear dynamic complexity.",0
82945,1,The long-term oscillations in sunspots and related inter-sunspot sources in microwave emission This work presents the microwave long-term oscillations with periods of a few tens of minutes obtained from Nobeyama radioheliograph (NoRH) at frequency 17 GHz. In two active regions the fluctuations of radio emission of different types of intersunspot sources (ISS) (compact and extended) were compared with the fluctuations in magnetic fields of sunspots. Common periods in variations of microwave emission of different type of sources and magnetic field of sunspots were discovered. The delay of 17 minutes was revealed for oscillations of the extended ISS with respect to variations of magnetic field of its tail sunspot. The model of the sunspot magnetic structure based on the concept of three magnetic fluxes for explanation of this fact is discussed.,0
82956,1,"Differential hypersaline stress response inZygosaccharomyces rouxiicomplex yeasts: a physiological and transcriptional study The Zygosaccharomyces rouxii complex comprises three distinct lineages of halotolerant yeasts relevant in food processing and spoilage, such as Z. sapae, Z. rouxii and a mosaic group of allodiploid strains. They manifest plastic genome architecture (variation in karyotype, ploidy level and Na+/H+ antiporter-encoding gene copy number), and exhibit diverse tolerances to salt concentrations. Here, we investigated accumulation of compatible osmolytes and transcriptional regulation of Na+/H+ antiporter-encoding ZrSOD genes during salt exposure in strains representative for the lineages, namely Z. sapae ABT301(T) (low salt tolerant), Z. rouxii CBS 732(T) (middle salt tolerant) and allodiploid strain ATCC 42981 (high salt tolerant). Growth curve modelling in 2 M NaCl-containing media supplemented with or without yeast extract as nitrogen source indicates that moderate salt tolerance of CBS 732(T) mainly depends on nitrogen availability rather than intrinsic inhibitory effects of salt. All the strains produce glycerol and not mannitol under salt stress and use two different glycerol balance strategies. ATCC 42981 produces comparatively more glycerol than Z. sapae and Z. rouxii under standard growth conditions and better retains it intracellularly under salt injuries. Conversely, Z. sapae and Z. rouxii enhance glycerol production under salt stress and intracellularly retain glycerol less efficiently than ATCC 42981. Expression analysis shows that, in diploid Z. sapae and allodiploid ATCC 42981, transcription of gene variants ZrSOD2-22/ZrSOD2 and ZrSOD22 is constitutive and salt unresponsive.The high salinity response in Zygosaccharomyces rouxii complex yeasts was studied by analysing how growth kinetic parameters are affected by transcriptional regulation of Na+/H+ antiporter-encoding ZrSOD genes and metabolically compatible osmolyte accumulation.The high salinity response in Zygosaccharomyces rouxii complex yeasts was studied by analysing how growth kinetic parameters are affected by transcriptional regulation of Na+/H+ antiporter-encoding ZrSOD genes and metabolically compatible osmolyte accumulation.",0

83120,1,"Milky Way Tomography with K and M Dwarf Stars: The Vertical Structure of the Galactic Disk We use the number density distributions of K and M dwarf stars with vertical height from the Galactic disk, determined using observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), to probe the structure of the Milky Way disk across the survey's footprint. Using photometric parallax as a distance estimator we analyze a sample of several million disk stars in matching footprints above and below the Galactic plane, and we determine the location and extent of vertical asymmetries in the number counts in a variety of thin and thick disk subsamples in regions of some 200 square degrees within 2 kpc in vertical distance from the Galactic disk. These disk asymmetries present wave-like features as previously observed on other scales and distances from the Sun. We additionally explore the scale height of the disk and the implied oset of the Sun from the Galactic plane at dierent locations, noting that the scale height of the disk can dier signicantly when measured using stars only above or only below the plane. Moreover, we compare the shape of the number density distribution in the north for dierent latitude ranges with a xed range in longitude and nd the shape to be sensitive to the selected latitude window. We explain why this may be indicative of a change in stellar populations in the compared latitude regions, possibly allowing access to the systematic metallicity dierence between thin and thick disk populations through photometry.",0

83438,1,"Optical properties, spectral, and lifetime measurements of central nervous system tumors in humans A key challenge of central nervous system tumor surgery is to discriminate between brain regions infiltrated by tumor cells and surrounding healthy tissue. Although monitoring of autofluorescence could potentially be an efficient way to provide reliable information for these regions, we found little information on this subject, and thus we conducted studies of brain tissue optical properties. This particular study focuses on the different optical quantitative responses of human central nervous system tumors and their corresponding controls. Measurements were performed on different fixed human tumoral and healthy brain samples. Four groups of central nervous system tumors (glioblastoma, diffuse glioma, meningioma and metastasis) were discriminated from healthy brain and meninx control tissues. A threshold value was found for the scattering and absorption coefficient between tumoral and healthy groups. Emission Spectra of healthy tissue had a significant higher intensity than tumoral groups. The redox and optical index ratio were thenn calculated and these also showed significant discrimination. Two fluorescent molecules, NADH and porphyrins, showed distinct lifetim values among the different groups of samples. This study defines several optical indexes that can act as combinated indicators to discriminate healthy from tumoral tissues.",0
83620,1,"On the Chemistry of the Young Massive Protostellar core NGC 2264 CMM3 We present the first gas-grain astrochemical model of the NGC 2264 CMM3 protostellar core. The chemical evolution of the core is affected by changing its physical parameters such as the total density and the amount of gas-depletion onto grain surfaces as well as the cosmic ray ionisation rate, $\zeta$ . We estimated $\zeta_{\text{CMM3}} = 1.6 \times 10^{-17}~\mbox{s}^{-1}$ . This value is 1.3 times higher than the standard CR ionisation rate, $\zeta _{\text{ISM}} = 1.3 \times 10^{-17}~\mbox{s}^{-1}$ . Species response differently to changes into the core physical conditions, but they are more sensitive to changes in the depletion percentage and CR ionisation rate than to variations in the core density.

84214,1,"Highly efficient rubrene-graphene charge transfer interfaces as phototransistors in the visible regime Atomically thin materials such as graphene are uniquely responsive to charge transfer from adjacent materials, making them ideal charge transport layers in phototransistor devices. Effective implementation of organic semiconductors as a photoactive layer would open up a multitude of applications in biomimetic circuitry and ultra-broadband imaging but polycrystalline and amorphous thin films have shown inferior performance compared to inorganic semiconductors. Here, we utilize the long-range order in rubrene single crystals to engineer organic semiconductor-graphene phototransistors surpassing previously reported photo-gating efficiencies by one order of magnitude. Phototransistors based upon these interfaces are spectrally selective to visible wavelengths and, through photoconductive gain mechanisms, achieve responsivity as large as 10^7 A/W and a detectivity of 1.5 10^9 Jones at room temperature. These findings point towards implementing low-cost, flexible materials for amplified imaging at ultra-low light levels.",0
84258,1,"Theory of Multiwave Mixing within the Superconducting Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Amplifier We present a theory of parametric mixing within the coplanar waveguide (CPW) of a superconducting nonlinear kinetic-inductance traveling-wave (KIT) amplifier engineered with periodic dispersion loadings. This is done by first developing a metamaterial band theory of the dispersion-engineered KIT using a Floquet-Bloch construction and then applying it to the description of mixing of the nonlinear RF traveling waves. Our theory allows us to calculate signal gain versus signal frequency in the presence of a frequency stop gap, based solely on loading design. We present results for both three-wave mixing (3WM), with applied dc bias, and four-wave mixing (4WM), without dc. Our theory predicts an intrinsic and deterministic origin to undulations of 4WM signal gain with signal frequency, apart from extrinsic sources, such as impedance mismatch, and shows that such undulations are absent from 3WM signal gain achievable with dc. Our theory is extensible to amplifiers based on Josephson junctions in a lumped LC-ladder transmission line (TWPA).",0
84292,1,"AFM study of hydrodynamics in boundary layers around micro- and nanofibers The description of hydrodynamic interactions between a particle and the surrounding liquid, down to the nanometer scale, is of primary importance since confined liquids are ubiquitous in many natural and technological situations. In this paper we combine three nonconventional atomic force microscopes to study hydrodynamics around micro- and nanocylinders. These complementary methods allow the independent measurement of the added mass and friction terms over a large range of probe sizes, fluid viscosities, and solicitation conditions. A theoretical model based on an analytical description of the velocity field around the probe shows that the friction force depends on a unique parameter, the ratio of the probe radius to the thickness of the viscous boundary layer. We demonstrate that the whole range of experimental data can be gathered in a master curve, which is well reproduced by the model. This validates the use of these atomic force microscopy modes for a quantitative study of hydrodynamics and opens the way to the investigation of other sources of dissipation in simple and complex fluids down to the submicron scale.",0
84300,1,"Algebraic Torsion in higher-dimensional contact manifolds We construct infinitely many non-diffeomorphic examples of 5-dimensional contact manifolds with order of algebraic torsion $2$, but not $1$.

We also prove that a higher-dimensional version of Giroux torsion implies algebraic 1-torsion in any odd dimension, which proves a conjecture by Massot-Niederkrueger-Wendl (MNW).

For every $m\in \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0}$, we propose candidates of higher-dimensional contact manifolds with order of algebraic torsion $m$, but not $m-1$ (and prove they indeed achieve $m$-torsion), which are inspired by examples by MNW. We give a tentative definition of a higher-dimensional SOBD, based on the 3-dimensional one by Lisi-van Horn Morris-Wendl.

84433,1,"Vertical Structure of Radiation-Pressure-Dominated Thin Disks: Link between Vertical Advection and Convective Stability In the classic picture of standard thin accretion disks, viscous heating is balanced by radiative cooling through the diffusion process, and the radiation-pressure-dominated inner disk suffers convective instability. However, recent simulations have shown that, owing to the magnetic buoyancy, the vertical advection process can significantly contribute to energy transport. In addition, in comparing the simulation results with the local convective stability criterion, no convective instability has been found. In this work, following on from simulations, we revisit the vertical structure of radiation-pressure-dominated thin disks and include the vertical advection process. Our study indicates a link between the additional energy transport and the convectively stable property. Thus, the vertical advection not only significantly contributes to the energy transport, but it also plays an important role in making the disk convectively stable. Our analyses may help to explain the discrepancy between classic theory and simulations on standard thin disks.",0

85142,1,"Spontaneous decoherence of coupled harmonic oscillators confined in a ring We study the spontaneous decoherence of coupled harmonic oscillators confined in a ring container, where the nearest-neighbor harmonic potentials are taken into consideration. Without any external symmetry-breaking field or surrounding environment, the quantum superposition state prepared in the relative degrees of freedom gradually loses its quantum coherence spontaneously. This spontaneous decoherence is interpreted by the gauge couplings between the center-of-mass and the relative degrees of freedoms, which actually originate from the symmetries of the ring geometry and the corresponding nontrivial boundary conditions. In particular, such spontaneous decoherence does not occur at all at the thermodynamic limit because the nontrivial boundary conditions become the trivial Born-von Karman boundary conditions when the perimeter of the ring container tends to infinity. Our investigation shows that a thermal macroscopic object with certain symmetries has a chance for its quantum properties to degrade even without applying an external symmetry-breaking field or surrounding environment.",0

The mode exhibits singular field enhancement, broad bandwidth, direction-dependent polarization, and robustness to certain defects. As a proof of concept, experimental results in the microwave regime are provided using patterned conducting sheets.

85753,1,"Fast Failure Erasure Encoding Using Just in Time Compilation for CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs Failure tolerant data encoding and storage is of paramount importance for data centers, supercomputers, data transfers, and many aspects of information technology. Reed-Solomon failure erasure codes and their variants are the basis for many applications in this field. Efficient implementation of these codes is challenging because they require computations in Galois fields, which are not supported by processors natively. Improved variants such as the Cauchy-Reed-Solomon code enable a better mapping of the required calculations to computer instructions. However, this works best when the source code of the application is tuned for fixed encoding parameters which deteriorates the flexibility. We present an approach to overcoming these limitations by just in time compiling optimized code for arbitrary encoding settings. Our open source library is optimized for x86 processors using SSE and AVX extensions and we present prototypes for GPUs and FPGAs as well. For a significant range of encoding parameters, our implementation encodes at the maximum bandwidth the processor can read the data from memory. In more complicated settings with additional redundancy data to compensate the failure of multiple data stores, the algorithm becomes compute limited. The optimized JIT code leverages the full potential of modern processors reaching an instruction throughput of more than three SIMD-instructions per compute cycle, and encodes up to 19 gigabytes of data per second on a Skylake system.",0

86167,1,"Casimir force in dense confined electrolytes Understanding the force between charged surfaces immersed in an electrolyte solution is a classic problem in soft matter and liquid-state theory. Recent experiments showed that the force decays exponentially but the characteristic decay length in a concentrated electrolyte is significantly larger than what liquid-state theories predict based on analysing correlation functions in the bulk electrolyte. Inspired by the classical Casimir effect, we consider an alternative mechanism for force generation, namely the confinement of density fluctuations in the electrolyte by the walls. We show analytically within the random phase approximation, which assumes the ions to be point charges, that this fluctuation-induced force is attractive and also decays exponentially, albeit with a decay length that is half of the bulk correlation length. These predictions change dramatically when excluded volume effects are accounted for within the mean spherical approximation. At high ion concentrations the Casimir force is found to be exponentially damped oscillatory as a function of the distance between the confining surfaces. Our analysis does not resolve the riddle of the anomalously long screening length observed in experiments, but suggests that the Casimir force due to mode restriction in density fluctuations could be an hitherto under-appreciated source of surface-surface interaction.",0

There, binary bits are carried by nanoscale spin swirls -- skyrmions -- driven along magnetic strips. Stability of the skyrmions is a critical issue for the realization of this technology. Here we evaluate the lifetime of skyrmions in a racetrack as a function of temperature and magnetic field using a combination of harmonic transition state theory, extended to include Goldstone modes, and an atomistic spin Hamiltonian parametrized from density functional theory calculations. We demonstrate that two mechanisms of skyrmion annihilation in a racetrack contribute to the skyrmion stability: At low external magnetic field, escape through the system boundary prevails, but a crossover field exists, above which the collapse in the interior becomes dominant. The calculated lifetime in a Pd/Fe bilayer on an Ir(111) substrate is found to be consistent with reported experimental measurements. Our results open the door for predictive simulations, free from empirical parameters, to aid the design of skyrmion-based information technology.",0

86632,1,"Stellar Winds and Coronae of Low-mass Pop. II/III Stars We investigated stellar winds from zero/low-metallicity low-mass stars by magnetohydrodynamical simulations for stellar winds driven by \Alfven waves from stars with mass $M_{\star}=(0.6-0.8)M_{\odot}$ and metallicity $Z=(0-1)Z_{\odot}$, where $M_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$ are the solar mass and metallicity, respectively. \Alfvenic waves, which are excited by the surface convection, travel upward from the photosphere and heat up the corona by their dissipation. For lower $Z$, denser gas can be heated up to the coronal temperature because of the inefficient radiation cooling. The coronal density of Pop.II/III stars with $Z\le 0.01Z_{\odot}$ is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the solar-metallicity star with the same mass, and as a result, the mass loss rate, $\dot{M}$, is $(4.5-20)$ times larger. This indicates that metal accretion on low-mass Pop.III stars is negligible. The soft X-ray flux of the Pop.II/III stars is also expected to be $\approx (1-30)$ times larger than that of the solar-metallicity counterpart owing to the larger coronal density, even though the radiation cooling efficiency is smaller. A larger fraction of the input \Alfvenic wave energy is transmitted to the corona in low $Z$ stars because they avoid severe reflection owing to the smaller density difference between the photosphere and the corona. Therefore, a larger fraction is converted to the thermal energy of the corona and the kinetic energy of the stellar wind. From this energetics argument, we finally derived a scaling of $\dot{M}$ as $\dot{M}\propto L R_{\star}^{11/9}M_{\star}^{-10/9}T_{\rm eff}^{11/2}\left[\max (Z/Z_{\odot},0.01)\right]^{-1/5}$, where $L$, $R_{\star}$, and $T_{\rm eff}$ are stellar luminosity, radius, and effective temperature, respectively.",0

We consider the cases that these bands are formed by electronic orbitals with angular momentum, such that, the hybridization $V(\mathbf{k})$ among them can be symmetric or antisymmetric under inversion symmetry. We take into account only intra-band attractive interactions in the two bands and investigate the appearance of an induced inter-band pairing gap. We show that (inter-band) superconducting orderings are induced in the total absence of attractive interaction between the two bands, which turns out to be completely dependent on the hybridization between them. For the case of antisymmetric hybridization we show that the induced inter-band superconductivity has a p-wave symmetry.",0

86993,1,"An Ensemble 4D Seismic History Matching Framework with Sparse Representation Based on Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis In this work we propose an ensemble 4D seismic history matching framework for reservoir characterization. Compared to similar existing frameworks in reservoir engineering community, the proposed one consists of some relatively new ingredients, in terms of the type of seismic data in choice, wavelet multiresolution analysis for the chosen seismic data and related data noise estimation, and the use of recently developed iterative ensemble history matching algorithms. Typical seismic data used for history matching, such as acoustic impedance, are inverted quantities, whereas extra uncertainties may arise during the inversion processes. In the proposed framework we avoid such intermediate inversion processes. In addition, we also adopt wavelet-based sparse representation to reduce data size. Concretely, we use intercept and gradient attributes derived from amplitude versus angle (AVA) data, apply multilevel discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) to attribute data, and estimate noise level of resulting wavelet coefficients. We then select the wavelet coefficients above a certain threshold value, and history-match these leading wavelet coefficients using an iterative ensemble smoother.

87159,1,"Optimality of the Maximum Likelihood estimator in Astrometry The problem of astrometry is revisited from the perspective of analyzing the attainability of well-known performance limits (the Cramer-Rao bound) for the estimation of the relative position of light-emitting (usually point-like) sources on a CCD-like detector using commonly adopted estimators such as the weighted least squares and the maximum likelihood. Novel technical results are presented to determine the performance of an estimator that corresponds to the solution of an optimization problem in the context of astrometry. Using these results we are able to place stringent bounds on the bias and the variance of the estimators in close form as a function of the data. We confirm these results through comparisons to numerical simulations under a broad range of realistic observing conditions. The maximum likelihood and the weighted least square estimators are analyzed. We confirm the sub-optimality of the weighted least squares scheme from medium to high signal-to-noise found in an earlier study for the (unweighted) least squares method. We find that the maximum likelihood estimator achieves optimal performance limits across a wide range of relevant observational conditions. Furthermore, from our results, we provide concrete insights for adopting an adaptive weighted least square estimator that can be regarded as a computationally efficient alternative to the optimal maximum likelihood solution. We provide, for the first time, close-form analytical expressions that bound the bias and the variance of the weighted least square and maximum likelihood implicit estimators for astrometry using a Poisson-driven detector. These expressions can be used to formally assess the precision attainable by these estimators in comparison with the minimum variance bound.",0
87294,1,"Semiclassical asymptotics of $\operatorname{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$ tensor products and quantum random matrices The Littlewood-Richardson process is a discrete random point process which encodes the isotypic decomposition of tensor products of irreducible rational representations of $\operatorname{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$. Biane-Perelomov-Popov matrices are a family of quantum random matrices arising as the geometric quantization of random Hermitian matrices with deterministic eigenvalues and uniformly random eigenvectors. As first observed by Biane, correlation functions of certain global observables of the LR process coincide with correlation functions of linear statistics of sums of classically independent BPP matrices, thereby enabling a random matrix approach to the statistical study of $\operatorname{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$ tensor products. In this paper, we prove an optimal result: classically independent BPP matrices become freely independent in any semiclassical/large-dimension limit. This removes all assumptions on the decay rate of the semiclassical parameter present in previous works, and may be viewed as a maximally robust geometric quantization of Voiculescu's theorem on the asymptotic freeness of independent unitarily invariant random Hermitian matrices. In particular, our work proves and generalizes a conjecture of Bufetov and Gorin, and shows that the mean global asymptotics of $\operatorname{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$ tensor products are governed by free probability in any and all semiclassical scalings. Our approach extends to global fluctuations, and thus yields a Law of Large Numbers for the LR process valid in all semiclassical scalings.",0
87308,1,"Gas dynamics in the Milky Way: a low pattern speed model We present gas flow models for the Milky Way based on high-resolution grid-based hydrodynamical simulations. The basic galactic potential we use is from an N-body model constrained by the density of red clump giants in the Galactic bulge. We augment this potential with a nuclear bulge, two pairs of spiral arms, and additional mass at the bar end to represent the long bar component. With this combined model we can reproduce many features in the observed ($l,v$) diagram with a bar pattern speed of $33\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{kpc}}^{-1}$ and a spiral pattern speed of $23\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{kpc}}^{-1}$. The shape and kinematics of the nuclear ring, Bania’s Clump 2, the Connecting arm, the Near and Far 3 kpc arms, the Molecular Ring, and the spiral arm tangent points in our simulations are comparable to those in the observations. Our results imply that a low pattern speed model for the bar in our Milky Way reproduces the observations for a suitable Galactic potential. Our best model gives a better match to the ($l,v$) diagram than previous high pattern speed hydrodynamical simulations.",0
87312,1,"Instability of warped discs Accretion discs are generally warped. If a warp in a disc is too large, the disc can `break' apart into two or more distinct planes, with only tenuous connections between them. Further if an initially planar disc is subject to a strong differential precession, then it can be torn apart into discrete annuli that precess effectively independently. In previous investigations, torque-balance formulae have been used to predict where and when the disc breaks into distinct parts. In this work, focusing on discs with Keplerian rotation and where the shearing motions driving the radial communication of the warp are damped locally by turbulence (the `diffusive' regime), we investigate the stability of warped discs to determine the precise criterion for an isolated warped disc to break. We find and solve the dispersion relation, which in general yields three roots. We provide a comprehensive analysis of this viscous-warp instability and the emergent growth rates and their dependence on disc parameters. The physics of the instability can be understood as a combination of (1) a term which would generally encapsulate the classical Lightman-Eardley instability in planar discs (given by $\partial(\nu\Sigma)/\partial\Sigma < 0$) but is here modified by the warp to include $\partial(\nu_1|\psi|)/\partial|\psi| < 0$ and (2) a similar condition acting on the diffusion of the warp amplitude given in simplified form by $\partial(\nu_2|\psi|)/\partial|\psi| < 0$. We discuss our findings in the context of discs with an imposed precession, and comment on the implications for different astrophysical systems.",0

In particular, the ordinal method defines sequences of symbols according to the ordering in which values appear in a time series.

Here we use ordinal analysis to investigate the transition between eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting states. We analyze two {EEG} datasets (with 71 and 109 healthy subjects) with different recording conditions (sampling rates and the number of electrodes in the scalp). Using as diagnostic tools the permutation entropy, the entropy computed from symbolic transition probabilities, and an asymmetry coefficient (that measures the asymmetry of the likelihood of the transitions between symbols) we show that ordinal analysis applied to the raw data distinguishes the two brain states. In both datasets, we find that the EO state is characterized by higher entropies and lower asymmetry coefficient, as compared to the EC state. Our results thus show that these diagnostic tools have the potential for detecting and characterizing changes in time-evolving brain states.",0

The full parameter region of the model is systematically studied using conventional and infinite density-matrix renormalization group as well as bosonization. The rich phase diagram consists of five distinct phases: A Haldane phase, a NNN-Haldane phase and a staggered dimer phase when $J_{\perp} &lt; 0$; a rung singlet phase and a columnar dimer phase when $J_{\perp} &gt; 0$. An interesting reentrant behavior from the dimerized phase into the Haldane phase is found as the frustration $J_2$ increases. The universalities of the critical phase transitions are fully analyzed. Phase transitions between dimerized and disordered phases belong to the two-dimensional Ising class with central charge $c=1/2$.

We investigate the properties of ITD components and show that the expected level of phase synchronization at a given change point may be enhanced by more than 4 folds when we employ multiple intrinsic components. Next, we introduce a concept of maximal mutual agreement to identify the set of ITD components that are most likely to capture the information about dynamical changes of interest, and define an InSync statistic to capture this local information. Extensive numerical as well as real-world case studies involving benchmark neurophysiological processes and industrial machine sensor data suggest that the present method can detect sharp change points and second/higher order moment shifts with average sensitivity of ~91% as compared to approximately 30% for other contemporary methods tested on the case studies presented.",0
88329,1,"Merging symmetry projection methods with coupled cluster theory: Lessons from the Lipkin model Hamiltonian Coupled cluster and symmetry projected Hartree-Fock are two central paradigms in electronic structure theory. However, they are very different. Single reference coupled cluster is highly successful for treating weakly correlated systems, but fails under strong correlation unless one sacrifices good quantum numbers and works with broken-symmetry wave functions, which is unphysical for finite systems. Symmetry projection is effective for the treatment of strong correlation at the mean-field level through multireference non-orthogonal configuration interaction wavefunctions, but unlike coupled cluster, it is neither size extensive nor ideal for treating dynamic correlation. We here examine different scenarios for merging these two dissimilar theories. We carry out this exercise over the integrable Lipkin model Hamiltonian, which despite its simplicity, encompasses non-trivial physics for degenerate systems and can be solved via diagonalization for a very large number of particles. We show how symmetry projection and coupled cluster doubles individually fail over different correlation limits, whereas models that merge these two theories are highly successful over the entire phase diagram. Despite the simplicity of the Lipkin Hamiltonian, the lessons learned in this work will be useful for building an ab initio symmetry projected coupled cluster theory that we expect to be accurate over the weakly and strongly correlated limits, as well as the recoupling regime.",0
88427,1,"Sonic Landau Levels and Synthetic Gauge Fields in Mechanical Metamaterials Mechanical strain can lead to a synthetic gauge field that controls the dynamics of electrons in graphene sheets as well as light in photonic crystals. Here, we show how to engineer an analogous synthetic gauge field for lattice vibrations. Our approach relies on one of two strategies: shearing a honeycomb lattice of masses and springs or patterning its local material stiffness. As a result, vibrational spectra with discrete Landau levels are generated. Upon tuning the strength of the gauge field, we can control the density of states and transverse spatial confinement of sound in the metamaterial. We also show how this gauge field can be used to design waveguides in which sound propagates with robustness against disorder as a consequence of the change in topological polarization that occurs along a domain wall. By introducing dissipation, we can selectively enhance the domain-wall-bound topological sound mode, a feature that may potentially be exploited for the design of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (SASER, the mechanical analogs of lasers).",0
88474,1,"Manifold boundaries give ""gray-box"" approximations of complex models We discuss a method of parameter reduction in complex models known as the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM). This approach, based on a geometric interpretation of statistics, maps the model reduction problem to a geometric approximation problem. It operates iteratively, removing one parameter at a time, by approximating a high-dimension, but thin manifold by its boundary. Although the method makes no explicit assumption about the functional form of the model, it does require that the model manifold exhibit a hierarchy of boundaries, i.e., faces, edges, corners, hyper-corners, etc. We empirically show that a variety of model classes have this curious feature, making them amenable to MBAM. These model classes include models composed of elementary functions (e.g., rational functions, exponentials, and partition functions), a variety of dynamical system (e.g., chemical and biochemical kinetics, Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems, and compartment models), network models (e.g., Bayesian networks, Markov chains, artificial neural networks, and Markov random fields), log-linear probability distributions, and models with symmetries.

A sure-fire recipe is provided to design models for Chern and unstable topological insulators by splitting elementary band representations; this recipe, combined with recently-constructed Bilbao tables on such representations, can be systematized for mass identification of topological materials.

The spectroscopic data are taken with the optical DOLoRes and near-IR NICS instruments at TNG, and include the previously unexplored range between C III] $\lambda$1910 and [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007.

The solution of the Slepian problem is a set of functions that are optimally concentrated and orthogonal within a spatial or spectral region. These properties make them useful for applications where measurements are taken within a spatially limited region of the sphere and/or a signal is only to be analyzed within a region of the sphere. To support localized spectral/spatial analysis, and estimation and sparse representation of localized data in these applications, we exploit the expansion of spherical harmonics in the complex exponential basis to develop an analytical formulation for the Slepian concentration problem for a limited colatitude-longitude spatial region. We also extend the analytical formulation for spatial regions that are comprised of a union of rotated limited colatitude-longitude subregions. By exploiting various symmetries of the proposed formulation, we design a computationally efficient algorithm for the implementation of the proposed analytical formulation.

We compare the total gas column densities, $N_{\rm{H}}$, derived from the $\gamma$ rays and stellar reddening with those inferred from a similar analysis (Remy et al. 2017) of $\gamma$ rays and of the optical depth of the thermal dust emission, $\tau_{353}$, at 353 GHz. We can therefore compare environmental variations in specific dust reddening, E(B-V)/$N_{\rm H}$, and in dust emission opacity (dust optical depth per gas nucleon), $\tau_{353}/N_{\rm{H}}$. Over the whole anti-centre region, we find an average E(B-V)/$N_{\rm H}$ ratio of $(2.02\pm0.48)\times$ $10^{-22}$~mag~cm$^2$, with maximum local variations of about $\pm30\%$ at variance with the two to six fold coincident increase seen in emission opacity as the gas column density increases. In the diffuse medium, the small variations in specific reddening, E(B-V)/$N_{\rm H}$ implies a rather uniform dust-to-gas mass ratio in the diffuse parts of the anti-centre clouds. The small amplitude of the E(B-V)/$N_{\rm H}$ variations with increasing $N_{\rm{H}}$ column density confirms that the large opacity $\tau_{353}/N_{\rm{H}}$ rise seen toward dense CO clouds is primarily due to changes in dust emissivity. The environmental changes are qualitatively compatible with model predictions based on mantle accretion on the grains and the formation of grain aggregates.",0
89344,1,"Higher-twisted periodic smooth Deligne cohomology Degree one twisting of Deligne cohomology, as a differential refinement of integral cohomology, was established in previous work. Here we consider higher degree twists. The Rham complex, hence de Rham cohomology, admits twists of any odd degree. However, in order to consider twists of integral cohomology we need a periodic version. Combining the periodic versions of both ingredients leads us to introduce a periodic form of Deligne cohomology. We demonstrate that this theory indeed admits a twist by a gerbe of any odd degree. We present the main properties of the new theory and illustrate its use with examples and computations, mainly via a corresponding twisted differential Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.",0
89467,1,"Leaders and followers: Quantifying consistency in spatio-temporal propagation patterns Repetitive spatio-temporal propagation patterns are encountered in fields as wide-ranging as climatology, social communication and network science. In neuroscience, perfectly consistent repetitions of the same global propagation pattern are called a synfire pattern. For any recording of sequences of discrete events (in neuroscience terminology: sets of spike trains) the questions arise how closely it resembles such a synfire pattern and which are the spike trains that lead/follow. Here we address these questions and introduce an algorithm built on two new indicators, termed SPIKE-order and spike train order, that define the synfire indicator value, which allows to sort multiple spike trains from leader to follower and to quantify the consistency of the temporal leader-follower relationships for both the original and the optimized sorting. We demonstrate our new approach using artificially generated datasets before we apply it to analyze the consistency of propagation patterns in two real datasets from neuroscience (giant depolarized potentials in mice slices) and climatology (El Niño sea surface temperature recordings). The new algorithm is distinguished by conceptual and practical simplicity, low computational cost, as well as flexibility and universality.",0
89525,1,"The Influence of Sagittarius and the Large Magellanic Cloud on the Milky Way Galaxy We present N-body simulations of a Sagittarius-like dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) that follow its orbit about the Milky Way (MW) since its first crossing of the Galaxy's virial radius to the present day. As Sgr orbits around the MW, it excites vertical oscillations, corrugating and flaring the Galactic stellar disc. These responses can be understood by a two-phase picture in which the interaction is first dominated by torques from the wake excited by Sgr in the MW dark halo before transitioning to tides from Sgr's direct impact on the disc at late times. We show for the first time that a massive Sgr model simultaneously reproduces the locations and motions of arc-like over densities, such as the Monoceros Ring and the Triangulum Andromeda stellar clouds, that have been observed at the extremities of the disc, while also satisfying the solar neighbourhood constraints on the vertical structure and streaming motions of the disc. In additional simulations, we include the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) self consistently with Sgr. The LMC introduces coupling through constructive and destructive interference, but no new corrugations. In our models, the excitation of the current structure of the outer disk can be traced to interactions as far back as 6-7 Gyr ago (corresponding to $z\leq1$). Given the apparently quiescent accretion history of the MW over this timescale, this places Sgr as the main culprit behind the vertical oscillations of the disc and the last major accretion event for the Galaxy with the capacity to modulate its chemodynamical structure.",0

89674,1,"Observational constraints on the physical nature of submillimetre source multiplicity: chance projections are common Interferometric observations have demonstrated that a significant fraction of single-dish submillimetre (submm) sources are blends of multiple submm galaxies (SMGs), but the nature of this multiplicity, i.e. whether the galaxies are physically associated or chance projections, has not been determined. We performed spectroscopy of 11 SMGs in six multi-component submm sources, obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for nine of them. For an additional two component SMGs, we detected continuum emission but no obvious features. We supplement our observed sources with four sources from the literature. This sample allows us to statistically constrain the physical nature of single-dish submm source multiplicity for the first time. In three [3/7, or 43 (-33/+39) per cent at 95% confidence] of the single-dish sources for which the nature of the blending is unambiguous, the components for which spectroscopic redshifts are available are physically associated, whereas 4/7 [57 (-39/+33) per cent] have at least one unassociated component. When components whose spectra exhibit continuum but no features and for which the photometric redshift is significantly different from the spectroscopic redshift of the other component are also considered, 6/9 [67 (-37/+26) per cent] of the single-dish sources are comprised of at least one unassociated component. The nature of the multiplicity of one single-dish source is ambiguous. We conclude that physically associated systems and chance projections both contribute to the multi-component single-dish submm source population. This result contradicts the conventional wisdom that bright submm sources are solely a result of merger-induced starbursts, as blending of unassociated galaxies is also important.",0
89915,1,"Theory of current-induced spin polarization in an electron gas We derive the Bloch equations for the spin dynamics of a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. For the latter we consider both the intrinsic mechanisms of structure inversion asymmetry (Rashba) and bulk inversion asymmetry (Dresselhaus), and the extrinsic ones arising from the scattering from impurities. The derivation is based on the SU(2) gauge-field formulation of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. Our main result is the identification of a spin-generation torque arising from Elliot-Yafet scattering, which opposes a similar term arising from Dyakonov-Perel relaxation. Such a torque, which to the best of our knowledge has gone unnoticed so far, is of basic nature, i.e., should be effective whenever Elliott-Yafet processes are present in a system with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, irrespective of further specific details. The spin-generation torque contributes to the current-induced spin polarization (CISP), also known as inverse spin-galvanic or Edelstein effect. As a result, the behavior of the CISP turns out to be more complex than one would surmise from consideration of the internal Rashba-Dresselhaus fields alone. In particular, the symmetry of the current-induced spin polarization does not necessarily coincide with that of the internal Rashba-Dresselhaus field, and an out-of-plane component of the CISP is generally predicted, as observed in recent experiments. We also discuss the extension to the three-dimensional electron gas, which may be relevant for the interpretation of experiments in thin films.",0

However, using these devices to trap and manipulate ultracold atomic systems for, e.g., quantum simulation is often complicated by the presence of kHz-frequency switching noise. Here we demonstrate a simple hardware extension that solves this problem and makes it possible to produce truly static light fields. This modification leads to a 47 fold increase in the time that we can hold ultracold 6Li atoms in a dipole potential created with the DMD. Finally, we provide reliable and user friendly APIs written in Matlab and Python to control the DMD.",0
90064,1,"Evolving Deep Networks Using HPC While a large number of deep learning networks have been studied and published that produce outstanding results on natural image datasets, these datasets only make up a fraction of those to which deep learning can be applied. These datasets include text data, audio data, and arrays of sensors that have very different characteristics than natural images. As these “best” networks for natural images have been largely discovered through experimentation and cannot be proven optimal on some theoretical basis, there is no reason to believe that they are the optimal network for these drastically different datasets. Hyperparameter search is thus often a very important process when applying deep learning to a new problem. In this work we present an evolutionary approach to searching the possible space of network hyperparameters and construction that can scale to 18, 000 nodes. This approach is applied to datasets of varying types and characteristics where we demonstrate the ability to rapidly find best hyperparameters in order to enable practitioners to quickly iterate between idea and result.",0

The results clarify the concept of quantum-superposition states is not required for the description of the interference, which leads to an improved understanding of the uncertainty principle and resolution of paradox of reduction of the wave packet, elimination of infinite zero-point energy and derivation of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

We explore the consequences of such broken integrability for the dynamics of a large number of particles and find three distinct regimes: initial, chaotic, and stationary. The initial regime is captured by an evolution equation for the phase-space distribution function. For any finite number of particles, this hydrodynamics breaks down and the dynamics becomes chaotic after a characteristic timescale determined by the interparticle distance and scattering length. The system fails to thermalize over the timescale studied (104 natural units), but the time-averaged ensemble is a stationary state of the hydrodynamic evolution.

90610,1,"Beyond conventional photon-number detection with click detectors Photon-number measurements are a fundamental technique for the discrimination and characterization of quantum states of light. Beyond the abilities of state-of-the-art devices, we present measurements with an array of 100 avalanche photodiodes exposed to photon-numbers ranging from well below to significantly above one photon per diode. Despite each single diode only discriminating between zero and non-zero photon-numbers we are able to extract characteristic information about the quantum state. We demonstrate a vast enhancement of the applicable intensity range by two orders of magnitude relative to the standard application of such devices. It turns out that the probabilistic mapping of arbitrary photon-numbers on a finite number of registered clicks is not per se a disadvantage compared with true photon counters. Such detector arrays can bridge the gap between single-photon and linear detection, by directly using the recorded data, without the need of elaborate data reconstruction methods.",0

90683,1,"Model selection for dynamical systems via sparse regression and information criteria We develop an algorithm for model selection which allows for the consideration of a combinatorially large number of candidate models governing a dynamical system. The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number of candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support , weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered disease model, Burgers’ equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.",0

The ponderomotive approach has its own validity limits well established, beyond which particles are resonantly trapped by the carrier waves. We show that under adequate conditions, the trapping mechanism places particles at an optimal relative phase with respect to the carrier for maximum acceleration. In addition to the analytical approach involved in the ponderomotive description, we use numerical simulations to validate the corresponding dynamics as well as to explore various features of the resonant trapping and acceleration.",0

91000,1,"Correcting Observation Model Error in Data Assimilation Standard methods of data assimilation assume prior knowledge of a model that describes the system dynamics and an observation function that maps the model state to a predicted output. An accurate mapping from model state to observation space is crucial in filtering schemes when adjusting the estimate of the system state during the filter's analysis step. However, in many applications the true observation function may be unknown and the available observation model may have significant errors, resulting in a suboptimal state estimate. We propose a method for observation model error correction within the filtering framework. The procedure involves an alternating minimization algorithm used to iteratively update a given observation function to increase consistency with the model and prior observations, using ideas from attractor reconstruction. The method is demonstrated on the Lorenz 1963 and Lorenz 1996 models, and on a single-column radiative transfer model with multicloud parameterization.",0

We find the optimal feasible conditions for generating a stationary entangled state between the qubits when they are initially prepared in their ground state. Furthermore, we analyse the effects of motion on the probability of spontaneous emission in the standard scenarios of single-atom and two-atom superradiance, where one or two excitations are initially present.

92048,1,"Multivariate analysis of short time series in terms of ensembles of correlation matrices When dealing with non-stationary systems, for which many time series are available, it is common to divide time in epochs, i.e. smaller time intervals and deal with short time series in the hope to have some form of approximate stationarity on that time scale. We can then study time evolution by looking at properties as a function of the epochs. This leads to singular correlation matrices and thus poor statistics. In the present paper, we propose an ensemble technique to deal with a large set of short time series without any consideration of non-stationarity. We randomly select subsets of time series and thus create an ensemble of non-singular correlation matrices. As the selection possibilities are binomially large, we will obtain good statistics for eigenvalues of correlation matrices, which are typically not independent. Once we defined the ensemble, we analyze its behavior for constant and block-diagonal correlations and compare numerics with analytic results for the corresponding correlated Wishart ensembles. We discuss differences resulting from spurious correlations due to repeatitive use of time-series. The usefulness of this technique should extend beyond the stationary case if, on the time scale of the epochs, we have quasi-stationarity at least for most epochs.",0
92088,1,"Shape (In)dependent Inequalities for Triangleland's Jacobi and Democratic-Linear Ellipticity Quantitities Sides and medians are both Jacobi coordinate magnitudes, moreover then equably entering the spherical coordinates on Kendall's shape sphere and the Hopf coordinates. This motivates treating medians on the same footing as sides in triangle geometry and the resulting Shape Theory. In this paper, we consequently reformulate inequalities for the medians in terms of shape quantities, and proceed to find inequalities on the mass-weighted Jacobi coordinates. This work moreover identifies the $4/3$ -- powers of which occur frequently in the theory of medians -- as the ratio of Jacobi masses. One of the Hopf coordinates is tetra-area. Another is anisoscelesness, which parametrizes whether triangles are left-or-right leaning as bounded by isoscelesness itself. The third is ellipticity, which parametrizes tallness-or-flatness of triangles as bounded by regular triangles. Whereas tetra-area is clearly cluster choice invariant, Jacobi coordinates, anisoscelesness and ellipticity are cluster choice dependent but can be `democratized' by averaging over all clusters. Democratized ellipticity moreover trivializes, due to ellipticity being the difference of base-side and median second moments, whose averages are equal to each other. Thus we introduce a distinct `linear ellipticity' quantifier of tallness-or-flatness of triangles whose democratization is nontrivial, and find inequalities bounding this. Some of this paper's inequalities are shape-independent bounds, whereas others' bounds depend on the isoperimetric ratio and arithmetic-to-geometric side mean ratio shape variables.",0

92519,1,"Chromatic Information and Feature Detection in Fast Visual Analysis The visual system is able to recognize a scene based on a sketch made of very simple features. This ability is likely crucial for survival, when fast image recognition is necessary, and it is believed that a primal sketch is extracted very early in the visual processing. Such highly simplified representations can be sufficient for accurate object discrimination, but an open question is the role played by color in this process. Rich color information is available in natural scenes, yet artist's sketches are usually monochromatic; and, black-andwhite movies provide compelling representations of real world scenes. Also, the contrast sensitivity of color is low at fine spatial scales. We approach the question from the perspective of optimal information processing by a system endowed with limited computational resources. We show that when such limitations are taken into account, the intrinsic statistical properties of natural scenes imply that the most effective strategy is to ignore fine-scale color features and devote most of the bandwidth to gray-scale information. We find confirmation of these information-based predictions from psychophysics measurements of fast-viewing discrimination of natural scenes. We conclude that the lack of colored features in our visual representation, and our overall low sensitivity to high-frequency color components, are a consequence of an adaptation process, optimizing the size and power consumption of our brain for the visual world we live in.",0

Fiducial panchromatic colors of Virgo core globular clusters and their comparison to model predictions The central region of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies contains thousands of globular clusters (GCs), an order of magnitude more than the number of clusters found in the Local Group. Relics of early star formation epochs in the universe, these GCs also provide ideal targets to test our understanding of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of old stellar populations. Based on photometric data from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and its near-infrared counterpart NGVS-IR, we select a robust sample of $\approx 2000$ GCs with excellent photometry and that span the full range of colors present in the Virgo core. The selection exploits the well-defined locus of GCs in the uiK diagram and the fact that the GCs are marginally resolved in the images. We show that the GCs define a narrow sequence in five-dimensional color space, with limited but real dispersion around the mean sequence. The comparison of these SEDs with the predictions of 11 widely used population synthesis models highlights differences between the models and also shows that no single model adequately matches the data in all colors. We discuss possible causes for some of these discrepancies. Forthcoming papers of this series will examine how best to estimate photometric metallicities in this context, and compare the Virgo GC colors with those in other environments.",0

In order to quantify entanglement we use the logarithmic negativity. The analytical solutions are presented for the system in a parameter regime very close to the current experimental results. We show that in the presence of the photon hopping process between the cavities, the two mechanical resonators and the field modes can be entangled.

Population increases of native herbivores, e.g., white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), combined with burgeoning plant invasions raise concerns for native plant diversity and forest regeneration. While individual researchers typically test for the impact of deer on plant invasion at a few sites, the overarching influence of deer on plant invasion across regional scales is unclear. We tested the effects of deer on the abundance and diversity of introduced and native herbaceous and woody plants across 23 white-tailed deer research sites distributed across the east central and northeastern United States and representing a wide range of deer densities and invasive plant abundance and identity. Deer access/exclusion or deer population density did not affect introduced plant richness or community-level abundance. Native and total plant species richness, abundance (cover and stem density), and Shannon diversity were lower in deer-access vs. deer-exclusion plots. Among deer access plots, native species richness, native and total cover, and Shannon diversity (cover) declined as deer density increased. Deer access increased the proportion of introduced species cover (but not of species richness or stem density). As deer density increased, the proportion of introduced species richness, cover, and stem density all increased. Because absolute abundance of introduced plants was unaffected by deer, the increase in proportion of introduced plant abundance is likely an indirect effect of deer reducing native cover. Indicator species analysis revealed that deer access favored three introduced plant species, including Alliaria petiolata and Microstegium vimineum, as well as four native plant species. In contrast, deer exclusion favored three introduced plant species, including Lonicera japonica and Rosa multiflora, and fifteen native plant species. Overall, native deer reduced community diversity, lowering native plant richness and abundance, and benefited certain invasive plants, suggesting pervasive impacts of this keystone herbivore on plant community composition and ecosystem services in native forests across broad swathes of the eastern US.",0
92735,1,"Stability of Quantum Loops and Exchange Operations in the Construction of Quantum Computation Gates Quantum information and quantum computation is a rapidly emergent field where quantum systems and their applications play a central role. In the gate version of quantum computation, the construction of universal quantum gates to manipulate quantum information is currently an intensive arena for quantum engineering. Specific properties of systems should be able to reproduce such idealized gates imitating the classically inspired computational gates. Recently, for magnetic systems driven by the bipartite Heisenberg-Ising model a universal set of gates has been realized, an alternative easy design for the Boykin set but using the Bell states as grammar. Exact control can be then used to construct specific prescriptions to achieve those gates. Physical parameters impose a challenge in the gate control. This work analyzes, based on the worst case quantum fidelity, the associated instability for the proposed set of gates. An strong performance is found in those gates for the most of quantum states involved.",0
92814,1,"VLT-SINFONI sub-kpc study of the star formation in local LIRGs and ULIRGs - Analysis of the global Σ$_{SFR}$ structure and characterisation of individual star-forming clumps We present a two-dimensional study of star formation at kiloparsec and sub-kiloparsec scales of a sample of local (z ) luminous (10) and ultraluminous (7) infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs), based on near-infrared VLT-SINFONI integral field spectroscopy (IFS). We obtained integrated measurements of the star formation rate and star formation rate surface density, together with their 2D distributions, based on Brgamma and Paalpha emission. In agreement with previous studies, we observe a tight linear correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) derived from our extinction-corrected Paalpha measurements and that derived from Spitzer 24 mum data, and a reasonable agreement with SFR derived from L_IR. We also compared our SFR_Paalpha values with optical measurements from Halpha emission and find that the SFR_Paalpha is on average a factor ~3 larger than the SFR_Halpha, even when the extinction corrections are applied. Within the angular resolution and sizes sampled by the SINFONI observations, we found that LIRGs have a median-observed star formation rate surface density of Sigma_LIRGs^obs=1.16M_&#8857;yr^-1kpc^-2, andSigma_LIRGs^corr=1.72M_&#8857;yr^-1kpc^-2 for the extinction-corrected distribution. The median-observed and the extinction-corrected Sigma_SFR values for ULIRGs areSigma_ULIRGs^obs=0.16M_&#8857;yr^-1kpc^-2 andSigma_ULIRGs^corr=0.23M_&#8857;yr^-1kpc^-2, respectively. These median values for ULIRGs increase up to 1.38M_&#8857;yr^-1kpc^-2 and 2.90M_&#8857;yr^-1kpc^-2, when only their inner regions, covering the same size as the average FoV of LIRGs, are considered. For a given fixed angular sampling, our simulations show that the predicted median of the Sigma_SFR distribution increases artificially with distance, a factor ~2-3 when the original measurements for LIRGs are simulated at the average distance of our ULIRGs. This could have consequences on any estimates of the star formation surface brightness in high-z galaxies, and consequently on the derivation of the universality of star formation laws at all redshifts. We identified a total of 95 individual star-forming clumps in our sample of U/LIRGs, with sizes that range within ~60-400pc and ~300-1500pc, and extinction-corrected Paalpha luminosities of ~10^5-10^7L_&#8857; and ~10^6-10^8L_&#8857; in LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively. The Sigma_SFR of the clumps presents a wide range of values within 1-90M_&#8857;yr^-1kpc^-2 and 0.1-100M_&#8857;yr^-1kpc^-2 for LIRGs and ULIRGs. Star-forming clumps in LIRGs are about ten times larger and thousands of times more luminous than typical clumps in spiral galaxies, which is consistent with expected photon-bounded conditions in ionized nebulae that surround young stellar clusters. Clumps in ULIRGs have sizes similar (x0.5-1) to those of high-z clumps, having Paalpha luminosities similar to some high-z clumps, and about 10 times less luminous than the most luminous high-z clumps identified so far. This could be an indication that the most luminous giant clumps in high-z star-forming galaxies are forming stars with a higher surface density rate than low-z compact ULIRGs. We also observed a change in the slope of the L-r relation, from eta = 3.04 of local samples to eta = 1.88 from high-z observations. A likely explanation is that most luminous galaxies are interacting and merging, and therefore their size represents a combination of the distribution of the star-forming clumps within each galaxy in the system plus the additional effect of the projected distance between the galaxies. As a consequence, this produces an overall size that is larger than that of individual clumps, or galaxies (for integrated measurements)",0
92925,1,"Information-theoretic limitations on approximate quantum cloning and broadcasting We prove quantitative limitations on any approximate simultaneous cloning or broadcasting of mixed states. The results are based on information-theoretic (entropic) considerations and generalize the well-known no-cloning and no-broadcasting theorems. We also observe and exploit the fact that the universal cloning machine on the symmetric subspace of n qudits and symmetrized partial trace channels are dual to each other. This duality manifests itself both in the algebraic sense of adjointness of quantum channels and in the operational sense that a universal cloning machine can be used as an approximate recovery channel for a symmetrized partial trace channel and vice versa. The duality extends to give control of the performance of generalized universal quantum cloning machines (UQCMs) on subspaces more general than the symmetric subspace. This gives a way to quantify the usefulness of a priori information in the context of cloning. For example, we can control the performance of an antisymmetric analog of the UQCM in recovering from the loss of n−k fermionic particles.",0

92990,1,"Spectral Test of the MIXMAX Random Number Generators An important statistical test on the pseudo-random number generators is called the spectral test. The test is aimed at answering the question of distribution of the generated pseudo-random vectors in dimensions $d$ that are larger than the genuine dimension of a generator $N$. In particular, the default MIXMAX generators have various dimensions: $N=8,17,240$ and higher. Therefore the spectral test is important to perform in dimensions $d > 8$ for $N=8$ generator, $d> 17$ for $N=17$ and $d> 240$ for $N=240$ generator. These tests have been performed by L'Ecuyer and collaborators. When $d > N$ the vectors of the generated numbers fall into the parallel hyperplanes and the distances between them can be larger than the genuine ""resolution"" of the MIXMAX generators, which is $ 2^{-61}$. The aim of this article is to further study the spectral properties of the MIXMAX generators, to investigate the dependence of the spectral properties of the MIXMAX generators as a function of their internal parameters and in particular their dependence on the parameter $m$. We found that the best spectral properties are realized when $m$ is between $2^{24}$ and $2^{36}$, a range which is inclusive of the value of the $N=17$ generator. We also provide the alternative parameters for the generators, $N=8$ and $N=240$ with $m$ in this optimised range.",0

Lett. 117, 220401 (2016)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.117.220401], we study the ground-state properties of interacting fermions in a one-dimensional optical lattice clock with spin-orbit coupling. As the electronic and the hyperfine-spin states in the clock-state manifolds can be treated as effective sites along distinct synthetic dimensions, the system can be considered as multiple two-leg ladders with uniform magnetic flux penetrating the plaquettes of each ladder. As the interorbital spin-exchange interactions in the clock-state manifolds couple individual ladders together, we show that exotic interaction-induced vortex states emerge in the coupled-ladder system, which compete with existing phases of decoupled ladders and lead to a rich phase diagram. Adopting the density matrix renormalization group approach, we map out the phase diagram, and investigate in detail the currents and the density-density correlations of the various phases. Our results reveal the impact of interactions on spin-orbit coupled systems, and are particularly relevant to the ongoing exploration of spin-orbit coupled optical lattice clocks.",0

The theoretical aspect of VNLEM is studied, which explains why the VNLEM and traditional non-local mean/non-local Euclidean median (NLEM) algorithm work. The numerical issue of the VNLEM is improved by taking the orientation feature in the commonly applied scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and a theoretical analysis of the robustness of the orientation feature in the SIFT is provided.

Different image quality assessments based on the error-sensitivity or the human visual system are applied to evaluate the performance. The results confirmed the potential of the VNLEM algorithm.",0

93237,1,"Accuracy of the adiabatic-impulse approximation for closed and open quantum systems We study the adiabatic-impulse approximation (AIA) as a tool to approximate the time evolution of quantum states when driven through a region of small gap. Such small-gap regions are a common situation in adiabatic quantum computing and having reliable approximations is important in this context. The AIA originates from the Kibble-Zurek theory applied to continuous quantum phase transitions. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism was developed to predict the power-law scaling of the defect density across a continuous quantum phase transition. Instead, here we quantify the accuracy of the AIA via the trace norm distance with respect to the exact evolved state. As expected, we find that for short times or fast protocols, the AIA outperforms the simple adiabatic approximation. However, for large times or slow protocols, the situation is actually reversed and the AIA provides a worse approximation. Nevertheless, we found a variation of the AIA that can perform better than the adiabatic one. This counterintuitive modification consists in crossing the region of small gap twice. Our findings are illustrated by several examples of driven closed and open quantum systems.",0
93338,1,"The Formation of S0 Galaxies with Counter-Rotating Neutral and Molecular Hydrogen The observation of counter-rotation in galaxies (i.e. gas that rotates in the opposite direction to the stellar component or two cospatial stellar populations with opposite rotation) is becoming more commonplace with modern integral field spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we explore the emergence of counter-rotation (both stellar and gaseous) in S0 galaxies from smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations of 1/10 mass ratio minor mergers between a ∼10^10.8 M_⊙ disc galaxy with a bulge-to-total ratio of 0.17 and a gas-rich companion (gas-to-stellar mass fraction of 5.0). These simulations include a self-consistent treatment of gas dynamics, star formation, the production/destruction of H_2 and dust and the time evolution of the interstellar radiation field. We explore the effect of retrograde versus prograde obits, gas and bulge mass fractions of the primary galaxy, and orbital parameters of the companion. The key requirement for producing counter-rotation in stars or gas in a merger remnant is a retrograde primary, while the relative spin of the companion affects only the radial extent of the accreted gas. We also find that including a significant amount of gas in the primary can prevent the emergence of counter-rotating gas, although accreted stars retain counter-rotation. Bulge mass and orbit have a secondary effect, generally influencing the final distribution of accreted stars and gas within the framework outlined above. In addition to our primary focus of counter-rotating components in galaxies, we also make some predictions regarding the SFRs, H_2 distributions, and dust in minor-merger remnants.",0
93372,1,"Knotted optical vortices in exact solutions to Maxwell's equations We construct a family of exact solutions to Maxwell's equations in which the points of zero intensity form knotted lines topologically equivalent to a given but arbitrary algebraic link. These lines of zero intensity, more commonly referred to as optical vortices, and their topology are preserved as time evolves and the fields have finite energy. To derive explicit expressions for these new electromagnetic fields that satisfy the nullness property, we make use of the Bateman variables for the Hopf field as well as complex polynomials in two variables whose zero sets give rise to algebraic links. The class of algebraic links includes not only all torus knots and links thereof, but also more intricate cable knots. While the unknot has been considered before, the solutions presented here show that more general knotted structures can also arise as optical vortices in exact solutions to Maxwell's equations.",0

An exponential decay law for difference-sideband generation in the presence of electric interaction is identified which exhibits more sensitivity to electrical charges than the conventional linearized effects. Using exact the same parameters with previous work based on the linearized dynamics of the optomechanical interactions, we show that optomechanically induced difference-sideband generation may enable an all-optical sensor for precision measurement of electrical charges with higher precision and lower power. The proposed mechanism is especially suited for on-chip optomechanical devices, where nonlinear optomechanical interaction in the weak coupling regime is within current experimental reach.",0

93652,1,"A silicon-based single-electron interferometer coupled to a fermionic sea We study Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry under the influence of projective readout using a charge qubit tunnel-coupled to a fermionic sea. This allows us to characterize the coherent charge-qubit dynamics in the strong-driving regime. The device is realized within a silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistor. We first read out the charge state of the system in a continuous nondemolition manner by measuring the dispersive response of a high-frequency electrical resonator coupled to the quantum system via the gate. By performing multiple fast passages around the qubit avoided crossing, we observe a multipassage LZSM interferometry pattern. At larger driving amplitudes, a projective measurement to an even-parity charge state is realized, showing a strong enhancement of the dispersive readout signal. At even larger driving amplitudes, two projective measurements are realized within the coherent evolution resulting in the disappearance of the interference pattern. Our results demonstrate a way to increase the state readout signal of coherent quantum systems and replicate single-electron analogs of optical interferometry within a CMOS transistor.",0
93712,1,"Electron system correlated by the zero-point field: physical explanation for the spin-statistics connection Which is the physical agent behind the antisymmetry of the electron state vectors? With the purpose to find an answer to this key question, we analyze the stationary states of a system containing two noninteracting electrons, using the tools of stochastic electrodynamics. In previous work, the resonant response of two particles to common modes of the random zero- point field has been shown to lead to the nonfactorizability of the composite state vector. Here we extend the analysis to particles with spin. When two electrons constitute a single system, a correlation is established between their dynamical variables through the common relevant modes of the zero-point field, which acts as a mediator. An analysis of the exchange properties of the bipartite state vectors obtained is shown to lead to the connection between spin and symmetry. The conclusion is that due consideration of the vacuum field in first quantization leads to the corresponding statistics for an assembly of electrons.",0

To observe this spectra correspondence in the high-frequency range, we study spoof plasmons on metallic hexagonal and kagomé lattices. The band correspondence between them is predicted by a simulation. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we demonstrate the band correspondence of fabricated metallic hexagonal and kagomé lattices.",0
94071,1,"Dynamics of linked filaments in excitable media In this paper we present the results of parallel numerical computations of the long-term dynamics of linked vortex filaments in a three-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable medium. In particular, we study all torus links with no more than 12 crossings and identify a timescale over which the dynamics is regular in the sense that each link is well-described by a spinning rigid conformation of fixed size that propagates at constant speed along the axis of rotation. We compute the properties of these links and demonstrate that they have a simple dependence on the crossing number of the link for a fixed number of link components. Furthermore, we find that instabilities that exist over longer timescales in the bulk can be removed by boundary interactions that yield stable torus links which settle snugly at the medium boundary. The Borromean rings are used as an example of a non-torus link to demonstrate both the irregular tumbling dynamics that arises in the bulk and its suppression by a tight confining medium. Finally, we investigate the collision of torus links and reveal that this produces a complicated wrestling motion where one torus link can eventually dominate over the other by pushing it into the boundary of the medium.",0

In fact, the Cu-doped, and pressure-tuned superconducting Bi2Se3 show no evidence of the time reversal symmetry breaking. We report on the detection of the time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in the topological superconductor Sr0.1Bi2Se3 , probed by zero-field (ZF) {\mu}SR measurements. The TRS breaking provides strong evidence for the existence of spin-triplet pairing state. The temperature dependent super-fluid density deduced from transverse-field (TF) {\mu}SR measurement yields nodeless superconductivity with low superconducting carrier density and penetration depth {\lambda} = 1622(134) nm. From the microscopic theory of unconventional pairing, we find that such a fully gapped spin triplet pairing channel is promoted by the complex interplay between the structural hexagonal warping and higher order Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling terms. Based on Ginzburg-Landau analysis, we delineate the mixing of singlet to triplet pairing symmetry as the chemical potential is tuned far above from the Dirac cone. Our observation of such spontaneous TRS breaking chiral superconductivity on a helical surface state, protected by the TRS invariant bulk topology, can open new avenues for interesting research and applications.",0
94762,1,"Direct Multipixel Imaging and Spectroscopy of an Exoplanet with a Solar Gravity Lens Mission The remarkable optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) include major brightness amplification (~1e11 at wavelength of 1 um) and extreme angular resolution (~1e-10 arcsec) in a narrow field of view. A mission to the SGL carrying a modest telescope and coronagraph opens up a possibility for direct megapixel imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy of a habitable Earth-like exoplanet at a distance of up to 100 light years. The entire image of such a planet is compressed by the SGL into a region with a diameter of ~1.3 km in the vicinity of the focal line. The telescope, acting as a single pixel detector while traversing this region, can build an image of the exoplanet with kilometer-scale resolution of its surface, enough to see its surface features and signs of habitability. We report here on the results of our initial study of a mission to the deep outer regions of our solar system, with the primary mission objective of conducting direct megapixel high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy of a potentially habitable exoplanet by exploiting the remarkable optical properties of the SGL. Our main goal was to investigate what it takes to operate spacecraft at such enormous distances with the needed precision. Specifically, we studied i) how a space mission to the focal region of the SGL may be used to obtain high-resolution direct imaging and spectroscopy of an exoplanet by detecting, tracking, and studying the Einstein ring around the Sun, and ii) how such information could be used to detect signs of life on another planet.

Here, we report atomically thin graphene-WS$_2$ heterostructure photodetectors encapsulated in an ionic polymer, which are uniquely able to operate at bandwidths up to 1.5 kHz, whilst maintaining internal gain as large as $10^6$. Highly mobile ions and a nanometre scale Debye length of the ionic polymer are used to screen charge traps and tune the Fermi level of graphene over an unprecedented range at the interface with WS$_2$.

95157,1,"Another look at AM Herculis $-$ radio-astrometric campaign with the e-EVN at 6 cm We conducted radio-interferometric observations of the well known binary cataclysmic system AM Herculis. This particular system is formed by the magnetic white dwarf (primary) and the red dwarf (secondary), and is the prototype of so-called polars. Our observations were conducted with the European VLBI Network (EVN) in the e-EVN mode at 5 GHz. We obtained six astrometric measurements spanning one year, which make it possible to update the annual parallax for this system with the best precision to date ($\pi=11.29\pm0.08$ mas), equivalent to the distance of $88.6\pm0.6$ pc. The system was observed mostly in the quiescent phase (visual magnitude $m_v\sim15.3$), when the radio emission was at the level of about $300~\mu$Jy. Our analysis suggests that the radio flux of AM Herculis is modulated with the orbital motion. Such specific properties of the radiation can be explained using the emission mechanism similar to the scenario proposed for V471 Tauri and, in general, for RS CVn type stars. In this scenario the radio emission arises near the surface of the red dwarf, where the global magnetic field strength may reach a few kG. We argue that the quiescent radio emission distinguishes AM Herculis together with AR Ursae Majoris (the second known persistent radio polar) from other polars, as the systems with a magnetized secondary star.",0
95161,1,"Nanosecond Dynamics at Protein Metal Sites: An Application of Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) of $\gamma$-Rays Spectroscopy Metalloproteins are essential to numerous reactions in nature, and constitute approximately one-third of all known proteins. Molecular dynamics of proteins has been elucidated with great success both by experimental and theoretical methods, revealing atomic level details of function involving the organic constituents on a broad spectrum of time scales. However, the characterization of dynamics at biomolecular metal sites on nanosecond time scales is scarce in the literature. The aqua ions of many biologically relevant metal ions exhibit exchange of water molecules on the nanosecond time scale or faster, often defining their reactivity in aqueous solution, and this is presumably also a relevant time scale for the making and breaking of coordination bonds between metal ions and ligands at protein metal sites. Ligand exchange dynamics is critical for a variety of elementary steps of reactions in metallobiochemistry, for example, association and dissociation of metal bound water, association of substrate and dissociation of product in the catalytic cycle of metalloenzymes, at regulatory metal sites which require binding and dissociation of metal ions, as well as in the transport of metal ions across cell membranes or between proteins involved in metal ion homeostasis.

In Perturbed Angular Correlation of γ-rays (PAC) spectroscopy, the correlation in time and space of two γ-rays emitted successively in a nuclear decay is recorded, reflecting the hyperfine interactions of the PAC probe nucleus with the surroundings. This allows for characterization of molecular and electronic structure as well as nanosecond dynamics at the PAC probe binding site. Herein, selected examples describing the application of PAC spectroscopy in probing the dynamics at protein metal sites are presented, including (1) exchange of Cd2+ bound water in de novo designed synthetic proteins, and the effect of remote mutations on metal site dynamics; (2) dynamics at the β-lactamase active site, where the metal ion appears to jump between the two adjacent sites; (3) structural relaxation in small blue copper proteins upon 111Ag+ to 111Cd2+ transformation in radioactive nuclear decay; (4) metal ion transfer between two HAH1 proteins with change in coordination number; and (5) metal ion sensor proteins with two coexisting metal site structures.

With this Account, we hope to make our modest contribution to the field and perhaps spur additional interest in dynamics at protein metal sites, which we consider to be severely underexplored. Relatively little is known about detailed atomic motions at metal sites, for example, how ligand exchange processes affect protein function, and how the amino acid composition of the protein may control this facet of metal site characteristics. We also aim to provide the reader with a qualitative impression of the possibilities offered by PAC spectroscopy in bioinorganic chemistry, especially when elucidating dynamics at protein metal sites, and finally present data that may serve as benchmarks on a relevant time scale for development and tests of theoretical molecular dynamics methods applied to biomolecular metal sites.",0

95419,1,"The emergence of braided magnetic fields We study the emergence of braided magnetic fields from the top of the solar interior through to the corona. It is widely believed that emerging regions smaller than active regions are formed in the upper convection zone near the photosphere. Here, bundles of braided, rather than twisted, magnetic field can be formed, which then rise upward to emerge into the atmosphere. To test this theory, we investigate the behaviour of braided magnetic fields as they emerge into the solar atmosphere. We compare and contrast our models to previous studies of twisted flux tube emergence and discuss results that can be tested observationally. Although this is just an initial study, our results suggest that the underlying magnetic field structure of small emerging regions need not be twisted and that braided field, formed in the convection zone, could suffice.",0
95459,1,"Speckle-Free Coherence Tomography of Turbid Media Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a powerful biomedical imaging technology that relies on the coherent detection of backscattered light to image tissue morphology in vivo. As a consequence, OCT is susceptible to coherent noise (speckle noise), which imposes significant limitations on its diagnostic capabilities. Here we show a method based purely on light manipulation that is able to entirely remove the speckle noise originating from turbid samples without any compromise in resolution. We refer to this method as Speckle-Free OCT (SFOCT). Using SFOCT, we succeeded in revealing small structures that are otherwise hidden by speckle noise when using conventional OCT, including the inner stromal structure of a live mouse cornea, the fine structures inside the mouse pinna, sweat ducts, and Meissners corpuscle in the human fingertip skin.

More specifically, a single-mode mechanical oscillator is quadratically coupled to a single-mode cavity field in the regime in which the cavity dissipation is a dominant source of damping, and adiabatic elimination of the cavity field leads to an effective cubic nonlinearity for the mechanics. We show analytically in the weak-coupling regime that the mechanics displays a chaotic phonon field for small optomechanical cooperativity, whereas an antibunched single-phonon field appears for large optomechanical cooperativity. This opens the door to control of the second-order correlation function of a mechanical oscillator in the weak-coupling regime.",0
95622,1,"Fast-growing SMBHs in Fast-growing Galaxies, at High Redshifts: the Role of Major Mergers as Revealed by ALMA We present a long-term, multi-wavelength project to understand the epoch of fastest growth of the most massive black holes by using a sample of 40 luminous quasars at z~4.8. These quasars have rather uniform properties, with typical accretion rates and black hole masses of L/L_Edd~0.7 and M_BH~10^9 M_sol. The sample consists of ""FIR-bright"" sources with a previous Herschel/SPIRE detection, suggesting SFR > 1000 M_sol/yr, as well as of ""FIR-faint"" sources for which Herschel stacking analysis implies a typical SFR of ~400 M_sol/yr. Six of the quasars have been observed by ALMA in [CII]{\lambda}157.74 micron line emission and adjacent rest-frame 150 micron continuum, to study the dusty cold ISM. ALMA detected companion, spectroscopically confirmed sub-mm galaxies (SMGs) for three sources - one FIR-bright and two FIR-faint. The companions are separated by ~14-45 kpc from the quasar hosts, and we interpret them as major galaxy interactions. Our ALMA data therefore clearly support the idea that major mergers may be important drivers for rapid, early SMBH growth. However, the fact that not all high-SFR quasar hosts are accompanied by interacting SMGs, and their ordered gas kinematics observed by ALMA, suggest that other processes may be fueling these systems. Our analysis thus demonstrates the diversity of host galaxy properties and gas accretion mechanisms associated with early and rapid SMBH growth.",0
95655,1,"The Role of Data Analysis in Uncertainty Quantification: Case Studies for Materials Modeling In computational materials science, mechanical properties are typically extracted from simulations by means of analysis routines that seek to mimic their experimental counterparts. However, simulated data often exhibit uncertainties that can propagate into final predictions in unexpected ways. Thus, modelers require data analysis tools that (i) address the problems posed by simulated data, and (ii) facilitate uncertainty quantification. In this manuscript, we discuss three case studies in materials modeling where careful data analysis can be leveraged to address specific instances of these issues. As a unifying theme, we highlight the idea that attention to physical and mathematical constraints surrounding the generation of computational data can significantly enhance its analysis.",0
95706,1,"Two new versions of Heron's Formula Recollect that Heron's formula for the area of a triangle given its sides has a counterpart given the medians instead, which carries an extra factor of $\frac{4}{3}$. On the one hand, we formulate the pair of these in Linear Algebra terms, showing that they are related by a sides-to-medians involution $J$, which we find to furthermore commute with the `Heron map' $H$ as visible in the expanded version of Heron. Upon further casting the pair of these in terms of mass-weighted Jacobi coordinates, we find moreover that they are placed on an exactly equal footing, the factor of $\frac{4}{3}$ having now cancelled out. This motivates the `Heron--Jacobi' version of Heron's formulae, for mass-weighted area in terms of mass-weighted sides and mass-weighted medians respectively. On the other hand, we show that diagonalizing the Heron map $H$ provides new derivations of, firstly, the famous Hopf map, and, secondly, of Kendall's Theorem that the space of triangles is a sphere. This occurs by the `Heron--Hopf' version of Heron's formula simplifying down to none other than the on-sphere condition. Thus we establish that -- both an important fibre bundle model, and a foundational theorem of Shape Theory: a widely applicable Differential Geometry and Topology topic -- arise together as consequences of just Heron's formula, Stewart's Theorem, and some elementary Linear Algebra manipulations. This working also accounts for the extra factor of 4 in the Hopf coordinate that is elsewise equal to the mass-weighted area in the 3-body problem context. It finally offers a new interpretation of the shape-theoretic ellipticity and anisoscelesness which realize the other two Hopf quantities: as eigenvectors shared by the Heron map $H$ and the sides-to-medians involution $J$.",0

95905,1,"Sigmoid-Based Refined Composite Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding Based Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearing Multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE) has been a prevalent tool to quantify the complexity of time series. However, it is extremely sensitive to the predetermined parameters and length of time series and it may yield an inaccurate estimation of entropy or cause undefined entropy when the length of time series is too short. In this paper the Sigmoid-based refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy (SRCMFE) is introduced to improve the robustness of complexity measurement of MFE for short time series analysis. Also SRCMFE is used to quantify the dynamical properties of mechanical vibration signals and based on that a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis approach is proposed by combining SRCMFE with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for feature dimension and variable predictive models based class discrimination (VPMCD) for mode classification. In the proposed method, SRCMFE firstly is employed to extract the complexity characteristic from vibration signals of rolling bearing and t-SNE for feature dimension reduction is utilized to obtain a low dimensional manifold characteristic. Then VPMCD is employed to construct a multi-fault classifier to fulfill an automatic fault diagnosis. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to experimental data of rolling bearing and the results indicate that the proposed method can effectively distinguish different fault categories of rolling bearings.",0
95931,1,"Comment on ""Benchmarking Compressed Sensing, Super-Resolution, and Filter Diagonalization"" In a recent paper [Int. J. Quant. Chem. (2016) DOI: 10.1002/qua.25144, arXiv:1502.06579] Markovich, Blau, Sanders, and Aspuru-Guzik presented a numerical evaluation and comparison of three methods, Compressed Sensing (CS), Super-Resolution (SR), and Filter Diagonalization (FDM), on their ability of ""recovering information"" from time signals, concluding that CS and RS outperform FDM. We argue that this comparison is invalid for the following reasons. FDM is a well established method designed for solving the harmonic inversion problem or, similarly, for the problem of spectral estimation, and as such should be applied only to problems of this kind. The authors incorrectly assume that the problem of data fitting is equivalent to the spectral estimation problem, regardless of what parametric form is used, and, consequently, in all five numerical examples FDM is applied to the wrong problem. Moreover, the authors' implementation of FDM turned out to be incorrect, leading to extremely bad results, caused by numerical instabilities. As we demonstrate here, if implemented correctly, FDM could still be used for fitting the data, at least for the time signals composed of damped sinusoids, resulting in superior performance. In addition, we show that the published article is full of inaccuracies, mistakes and incorrect statements.",0

Selection rules forbid these transitions in zero magnetic field. At the same time, the probabilities of these transitions in a magnetic field increase significantly; for this reason, we refer to these transitions as magnetically induced transitions. The following rule has been found for the intensities of $24$ magnetically induced $F_{\text{g}}=3\to F_{\text{e}}=5$ and $F_{\text{g}}=4\to F_{\text{e}}=2$ transitions: the intensities of magnetically induced transitions with $\Delta F=+2$ are maximal (the number of such magnetically induced transitions is also maximal) in the case of $\sigma^+$ polarized radiation, whereas the intensities of magnetically induced transitions with $\Delta F=-2$ are maximal (the number of such transitions is also maximal) in the case of $\sigma^-\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ polarized radiation can reach several orders of magnitude; i.e., anomalous circular dichroism is observed. For an experimental test, absorption spectra of a Cs-filled nanocell with the thickness equal to half the wavelength of resonant laser radiation $= 852$ nm have been analyzed in order to separately detect magnetically induced transitions. The experiment is in good agreement with the theory. Possible applications have been discussed.",0

96804,1,"Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics for Rapid Model Recovery Big data has become a critically enabling component of emerging mathematical methods aimed at the automated discovery of dynamical systems, where first principles modeling may be intractable. However, in many engineering systems, abrupt changes must be rapidly characterized based on limited, incomplete, and noisy data. Many leading automated learning techniques rely on unrealistically large data sets and it is unclear how to leverage prior knowledge effectively to re-identify a model after an abrupt change. In this work, we propose a conceptual framework to recover parsimonious models of a system in response to abrupt changes in the low-data limit. First, the abrupt change is detected by comparing the estimated Lyapunov time of the data with the model prediction. Next, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) regression to update a previously identified model with the fewest changes, either by addition, deletion, or modification of existing model terms. We demonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system change detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems. Our examples show that sparse updates to a previously identified model perform better with less data, have lower runtime complexity, and are less sensitive to noise than identifying an entirely new model. The proposed abrupt-SINDy architecture provides a new paradigm for the rapid and efficient recovery of a system model after abrupt changes.",0
96837,1,"Study of acoustic emission due to vaporisation of superheated droplets at higher pressure Bubble nucleation in superheated liquids can be controlled by adjusting the ambient pressure and temperature. At higher pressure the threshold energy for bubble nucleation increases, and we have observed that the amplitude of the acoustic emission during vaporisation of superheated droplet decreases with increase in pressure at any given temperature. Other acoustic parameters such as the primary harmonic frequency and the decay time constant of the acoustic signal also decrease with increase in pressure. This behavior is independent of the type of superheated liquid. The decrease in signal amplitude limits the detection of bubble nucleation at higher pressure. This effect is explained by the emission of shockwave generated during the supersonic growth of the microbubble in superheated liquids.",0

We conclude that planets orbiting most M-dwarfs are not likely to host life, and that the highest probability of complex biospheres is for planets around K- and G-type stars. Our analysis suggests that the current existence of life near the Sun is slightly unusual, but not significantly anomalous.",0

However, to gain enumerative information by using a meaningful intersection theory, it is necessary to consider compactifications of these moduli spaces. Doing so, an essential point is to provide a modular interpretation of the new objects on the boundary - and this can be understood from two, rather opposite viewpoints: On the one hand, we will study degenerations of classical objects, and on the other, we might start with singular, sometimes rather combinatorial objects and look for deformations, e.g. smoothings.

97177,1,Control of Spin-Wave Refraction Using Arrays of Skyrmions A periodically patterned and magnetized medium for controlling spin waves is proposed in a magnonic device and presents a clear advantage compared with other metamaterials because of the tunability in reconfiguring its pattern during operation. We study the spin-wave propagation numerically by controlling the arrangement of two magnetic Skyrmion arrays instead of patterned structures. The adjustment the position of each of the Skyrmion arrays could result in distinct spin-wave propagation or refraction depending on the location of the Skyrmions in each array. Control of the arrangement of two Skyrmion arrays can be made by an asymmetric magnetic field generated by a symmetric electrode with different current directions. This simple method of spin-wave manipulation can be applied to the development of magnonic devices consisting of Skyrmions as the building blocks of the magnonic crystals.,0

By carrying out a renormalization group analysis of an effective field theory, we obtain the energy-scale dependent flows of all the model parameters, and then apply the results to understand the observed phase diagram. On the basis of the renormalization group analysis, we show that the critical line of nematic order has a negative slope in the superconducting dome and superconductivity is suppressed near the magnetic quantum critical point, which are both consistent with recent experiments. Moreover, we find that, although the observed C4 symmetric magnetic state could be a charge-spin density wave or a spin-vortex crystal at high temperatures, charge-spin density wave is the only stable C4 magnetic state in the low-temperature regime. Therefore, ordering competition provides a method to distinguish these two candidate C4 magnetic states.",0

97702,1,"Ion-induced nucleation of pure biogenic particles Atmospheric aerosols and their effect on clouds are thought to be important for anthropogenic radiative forcing of the climate, yet remain poorly understood1. Globally, around half of cloud condensation nuclei originate from nucleation of atmospheric vapours2. It is thought that sulfuric acid is essential to initiate most particle formation in the atmosphere3, 4, and that ions have a relatively minor role5. Some laboratory studies, however, have reported organic particle formation without the intentional addition of sulfuric acid, although contamination could not be excluded6, 7. Here we present evidence for the formation of aerosol particles from highly oxidized biogenic vapours in the absence of sulfuric acid in a large chamber under atmospheric conditions. The highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) are produced by ozonolysis of α-pinene. We find that ions from Galactic cosmic rays increase the nucleation rate by one to two orders of magnitude compared with neutral nucleation. Our experimental findings are supported by quantum chemical calculations of the cluster binding energies of representative HOMs. Ion-induced nucleation of pure organic particles constitutes a potentially widespread source of aerosol particles in terrestrial environments with low sulfuric acid pollution.",0

The Laplacian is associated with the flow of Ricci curvature and with topological invariants of the observed field - Betti numbers for compact manifolds. Using discrete version of Morse theory, we consider each pixel of energy flux (B(2)) image as a simplex and calculate its combinatorial Bochner Laplacian. It was found that maximum of Laplacian is located near AR polarity inversion line. Evolution of total spatial variation of the Laplacian has a number of maxima in time for each of examined AR.

Applying random matrix theory to the problem, we derive an exact result for the joint distribution of the transmission intensity (envelope) and the transmission phase at arbitrary coupling to the background with finite absorption. The intensity and phase are distributed within a certain region, revealing essential correlations even at strong absorption. In the latter limit, we obtain a simple asymptotic expression that provides a uniformly good approximation of the exact distribution within its whole support, thus going beyond the Rician distribution often used for such purposes. Exact results are also derived for the marginal distribution of the phase, including its limiting forms at weak and strong absorption.",0

We show that for values of the trap shape parameter equal or smaller than 2 the system seems to be stable. However, when the shape of the potential is bigger that 2, the instability of the system grows when the shape parameter grows, indicating that large values of the aforementioned parameter can be related to a lost in the number of particles from the condensed state.

98378,1,"A New Approach for 4DVar Data Assimilation Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) has become an increasingly important tool in data science with wide applications in many engineering and scientific fields such as geoscience1-12, biology13 and the financial industry14. The 4DVar seeks a solution that minimizes the departure from the background field and the mismatch between the forecast trajectory and the observations within an assimilation window. The current state-of-the-art 4DVar offers only two choices by using different forms of the forecast model: the strong- and weak-constrained 4DVar approaches15-16. The former ignores the model error and only corrects the initial condition error at the expense of reduced accuracy; while the latter accounts for both the initial and model errors and corrects them separately, which increases computational costs and uncertainty. To overcome these limitations, here we develop an integral correcting 4DVar (i4DVar) approach by treating all errors as a whole and correcting them simultaneously and indiscriminately. To achieve that, a novel exponentially decaying function is proposed to characterize the error evolution and correct it at each time step in the i4DVar. As a result, the i4DVar greatly enhances the capability of the strong-constrained 4DVar for correcting the model error while also overcomes the limitation of the weak-constrained 4DVar for being prohibitively expensive with added uncertainty. Numerical experiments with the Lorenz model show that the i4DVar significantly outperforms the existing 4DVar approaches. It has the potential to be applied in many scientific and engineering fields and industrial sectors in the big data era because of its ease of implementation and superior performance.",0
98473,1,"Outflows and complex stellar kinematics in SDSS star forming galaxies We investigate the properties of star-formation-driven outflows by using a large spectroscopic sample of ~160000 local 'normal' star-forming galaxies drawn from the Sloan digital sky survey (SDSS), spanning a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses (M_&#8727;). The galaxy sample is divided into a fine grid of bins in the M_&#8727;-SFR parameter space, for each of which we produced a composite spectrum by stacking the SDSS spectra of the galaxies contained in that bin together. We exploited the high signal-to-noise of the stacked spectra to study the emergence of faint features of optical emission lines that may trace galactic outflows and are otherwise too faint to detect in individual galaxy spectra. We have adopted a novel approach that relies on the comparison between the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LoSVD) of the ionised gas (as traced by the [OIII]lambda5007 and Halpha+[NII]lambdalambda6548, 6583 emission lines) and the LoSVD of the stars, which are used as a reference for tracing virial motions. Significant deviations in the gas kinematics from the stellar kinematics in the high-velocity tail of the LoSVDs are interpreted as a signature of outflows. Our results suggest that the incidence of ionised outflows increases with SFR and specific SFR. The outflow velocity (v_out) is found to correlate tightly with the SFR for SFR> 1 M_&#8857; yr^-1, whereas the dependence of v_out on SFR is nearly flat at lower SFRs. The outflow velocity appears to also increase with the stellar velocity dispersion (sigma_&#8727;), although this relation has a much larger scatter than the one with SFR, and we infer velocities as high as v_out ~ (6-8)sigma_&#8727;. Strikingly, we detect the signature of ionised outflows only in galaxies located above the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies in the M_&#8727;-SFR diagram, and the incidence of such outflows increases sharply with the offset from the MS. This result suggests that star-formation-driven outflows may be responsible for shaping the upper envelope of the MS by providing a self-regulating mechanism for star formation. Finally, our complementary analysis of the stellar kinematics reveals the presence of blue asymmetries of a few 10 kms^-1 in the stellar LoSVDs. The origin of such asymmetries is not clear, but a possibility is that they trace the presence of a large number of high velocity runaway stars and hypervelocity stars in radial trajectories in local galaxies.",0

In particular, we show that if G is a classical compact simple Lie group and H is a closed subgroup such that G/H is a standard homogeneous Einstein manifold, then there exist holonomy irreducible non-naturally reductive Einstein metrics on H×G , except for some very special cases. A further interesting result of this paper is that for any compact simple Lie group G , there always exist holonomy irreducible non-naturally reductive Einstein metrics on the compact semisimple Lie groups Gn , for any n≥4 .",0

This presentation will introduce the historical and cultural background behind the invention of Hangul and describe the systematic linguistic principles on which it is based.

98740,1,"Extinction Laws Toward Stellar Sources Within a Dusty Circumstellar Medium and Implications for Type ia Supernovae Many astronomical objects are surrounded by dusty environments. In such dusty objects, multiple scattering processes of photons by circumstellar (CS) dust grains can effectively alter extinction properties. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effects of multiple scattering on extinction laws for steady-emission sources surrounded by the dusty CS medium using a radiation transfer simulation based on the Monte Carlo technique. In particular, we focus on whether and how the extinction properties are affected by properties of CS dust grains by adopting various dust grain models. We confirm that behaviors of the (effective) extinction laws are highly dependent on the properties of CS grains, especially the total-to-selective extinction ratio R ( )V( ), which characterizes the extinction law and can be either increased or decreased and compared with the case without multiple scattering. We find that the criterion for this behavior is given by a ratio of albedos in the B and V bands. We also find that either small silicate grains or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are necessary for realizing a low value of R ( )V( ) as often measured toward SNe Ia if the multiple scattering by CS dust is responsible for their non-standard extinction laws. Using the derived relations between the properties of dust grains and the resulting effective extinction laws, we propose that the extinction laws toward dusty objects could be used to constrain the properties of dust grains in CS environments.",0
98781,1,"Nonlinear effects due to parametric resonance in modulated 1D atomic Bose condensates We present a numerical study of the dynamical effects following a sudden change of the transverse trapping frequency in an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, which induces periodic oscillations of the radial density. At early times, we observe an exponential growth of the number of resonant longitudinal phonons, in agreement with the predictions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes treatment. We then observe an ordered sequence of phenomena induced by the nonlinearities of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The first is a loss of the nonseparability of the resonant phonon pairs. This is followed by the saturation of the exponential growth and a strong depletion of condensed atoms. Notably, these effects are well-described by effective 1D dynamics, and are hardly affected by the damping of the radial oscillations. Finally, the atomic spectrum becomes broad, featureless and almost incoherent, in agreement with experimental results obtained in [J.-C. Jaskula et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 220401 (2012)]. The link between this sequence of events and the preheating scenario in inflationary cosmology is striking.",0

However, designing topological nodal points in photonic crystals is much more difficult than in electronic systems due to lack of the atomic picture. We propose an atomic approach for the design of three-dimensional Dirac and Weyl points via Mie resonances which can be viewed as photonic local orbits. Using connected-hollow-cylinder structure as an example we demonstrate how to design topological degeneracy points in photonic energy bands by tuning the geometric shape. We discover a new type of topological degeneracy three-dimensional photonic spectrum, the $Z_2$ Dirac points, which are monopoles of the $SU(2)$ Berry-flux protected by the parity-time symmetry. Upon breaking the inversion symmetry each Dirac point splits into a pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality. Our study provides new methodology and example for future topological photonics where monopoles and surface states offer unprecedented control of light flow.",0

The devices employ sequential resonant tunneling and can provide optical gain on the diagonal or vertical transition. Depending on the tunneling resonance detuning, the lasers can operate either on a stable part of I-V curve or with unstable electric field domain formation. We report how all these features impact the occurrence of the RNGH instability with broadband multimode emission, and show how they can be tailored with an applied bias or via optical excitation of free carriers. We present the results of 2nd order interferometric autocorrelation measurements and time-resolved spectral measurements in free-running QCLs and QCLs subjected to optical pumping. We explain the diversity of dynamic regimes in QCLs using a simple analytical expression for the second threshold.",0

This new algorithms-based and semi-automatic procedure allowed to investigate with high resolution the 3D internal structure of two ancient papyrus rolls formerly analysed by X-ray phase-contrast tomography. Through a new rendering procedure, selected regions inside the rolls could be identified and isolated and the different sheets could be peeled one by one virtually, all without damaging these very precious manuscripts.

The OVNA method is based on generation and detection of modulated optical sideband by using a radio-frequency vector network analyzer. This technique is widely used in the field of microwave photonics for the characterization of optical responses of optical devices such as filters and high-Q resonators. However, dense solid-state atomic ensembles induce a large phase shift on one of the optical sidebands which results in the appearance of extra features on the measured transmission response.

99480,1,"Quantum superreplication of states and gates Although the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect replication of quantum information, it is sometimes possible to produce large numbers of replicas with vanishingly small error. This phenomenon, known as quantum superreplication, can occur for both quantum states and quantum gates. The aim of this paper is to review the central features of quantum superreplication and provide a unified view of existing results. The paper also includes new results. In particular, we show that when quantum superreplication can be achieved, it can be achieved through estimation up to an error of size O(M/N$^{2}$), where N and M are the number of input and output copies, respectively. Quantum strategies still offer an advantage for superreplication in that they allow for exponentially faster reduction of the error. Using the relation with estimation, we provide i) an alternative proof of the optimality of Heisenberg scaling in quantum metrology, ii) a strategy for estimating arbitrary unitary gates with a mean square error scaling as log N/N$^{2}$, and iii) a protocol that generates O(N$^{2}$) nearly perfect copies of a generic pure state U |0〉 while using the corresponding gate U only N times. Finally, we point out that superreplication can be achieved using interactions among k systems, provided that k is large compared to M$^{2}$/N$^{2}$.",0

99567,1,"In Situ Detection and Single Cell Quantification of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles Using Nuclear Microprobe Analysis Micro-analytical techniques based on chemical element imaging enable the localization and quantification of chemical composition at the cellular level. They offer new possibilities for the characterization of living systems and are particularly appropriate for detecting, localizing and quantifying the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles both in biological specimens and the environment. Indeed, these techniques all meet relevant requirements in terms of (i) sensitivity (from 1 up to 10 µg.g-1 of dry mass), (ii) micrometer range spatial resolution, and (iii) multi-element detection. Given these characteristics, microbeam chemical element imaging can powerfully complement routine imaging techniques such as optical and fluorescence microscopy. This protocol describes how to perform a nuclear microprobe analysis on cultured cells (U2OS) exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Cells must grow on and be exposed directly in a specially designed sample holder used on the optical microscope and in the nuclear microprobe analysis stages. Plunge-freeze cryogenic fixation of the samples preserves both the cellular organization and the chemical element distribution. Simultaneous nuclear microprobe analysis (scanning transmission ion microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and particle induced X-ray emission) performed on the sample provides information about the cellular density, the local distribution of the chemical elements, as well as the cellular content of nanoparticles. There is a growing need for such analytical tools within biology, especially in the emerging context of Nanotoxicology and Nanomedicine for which our comprehension of the interactions between nanoparticles and biological samples must be deepened. In particular, as nuclear microprobe analysis does not require nanoparticles to be labelled, nanoparticle abundances are quantifiable down to the individual cell level in a cell population, independently of their surface state.",0

99840,1,"Variability of the adiabatic parameter in monoatomic thermal and non-thermal plasmas {\bf Context.} Numerical models of the evolution of interstellar and integalactic plasmas often assume that the adiabatic parameter $\gamma$ (the ratio of the specific heats) is constant (5/3 in monoatomic plasmas). However, $\gamma$ is determined by the total internal energy of the plasma, which depends on the ionic and excitation state of the plasma. Hence, the adiabatic parameter may not be constant across the range of temperatures available in the interstellar medium. {\bf Aims.} We aim to carry out detailed simulations of the thermal evolution of plasmas with Maxwell-Boltzmann and non-thermal ($\kappa$ and $n$) electron distributions in order to determine the temperature variability of the total internal energy and of the adiabatic parameter. {\bf Methods.} The plasma, composed of H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe atoms and ions, evolves under collisional ionization equilibrium conditions, from an initial temperature of $10^9$ K. The calculations include electron impact ionization, radiative and dielectronic recombinations and line excitation. The ionization structure was calculated (...) using the Gauss elimination method with scaled partial pivoting. Numerical integrations (...) were carried out using the double-exponential over a semi-finite interval method. In both methods a precision of $10^{-15}$ is adopted. {\bf Results.} The total internal energy of the plasma is mainly dominated by the ionization energy for temperatures lower than $8\times 10^4$ K with the excitation energy having a contribution of less than one percent. In thermal and non-thermal plasmas composed of H, He, and metals, the adiabatic parameter evolution is determined by the H and He ionizations leading to a profile in general having three transitions. However, for $\kappa$ distributed plasmas these three transitions are not observed for $\kappa<15$ (...). In general, $\gamma$ varies from 1.01 to 5/3.",0
99853,1,"Space-time random walk loop measures Recently Markovian Loop measures have become an active field in probability (LeJan,Sznitman) with its origin going back to Symanzik [Sym69] and Brydges et al. [BFS82]. In this work we are going to investigate a novel setting of these loop measures, namely we consider first loop soups with varying intensity $ \mu\le 0 $ (chemical potential in physics terms). Secondly, we study Markovian loop measures on graphs with an additional time dimension leading to so-called space-time random walks and their loop measures and Poisson point loop processes. Interesting phenomena appear when the additional coordinate of the space-time process is on a discrete torus with non-symmetric jumping rates. The projection of these space-time random walk loop measures onto the space dimensions are loop measures on the spatial graph, and in the scaling limit of the discrete torus these loop measures converge to the so-called Bosonic loop measures. These novel loop measures have similarities with the standard Markovian loop measures. The Bosonic loop measures not only have the probabilistic motivation as outlined, a second major interest in these objects stems from the fact the the total weights of the Bosonic loop measure for a finite graph is exactly the logarithm of the grand-canonical partition function of non-interacting Bose gases in thermodynamic equilibrium at inverse temperature $ \beta&gt;0 $ and chemical potential $ \mu\le 0 $. We complement our study with generalised versions of Dynkin's isomorphim theorem as well as Symanzik's moment formulae for complex Gaussian measures. Due to the lacking symmetry of our space-time random walks, the distributions of the occupation time fields is given in terms of a complex Gaussian measures over complex-valued random fields [B92,BIS09].",0
99914,1,"Non-signalling energy use in the developing rat brain Energy use in the brain constrains its information processing power, but only about half the brain's energy consumption is directly related to information processing. Evidence for which non-signalling processes consume the rest of the brain's energy has been scarce. For the first time, we investigated the energy use of the brain's main non-signalling tasks with a single method. After blocking each non-signalling process, we measured oxygen level changes in juvenile rat brain slices with an oxygen-sensing microelectrode and calculated changes in oxygen consumption throughout the slice using a modified diffusion equation. We found that the turnover of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, followed by lipid synthesis, are significant energy drains, contributing 25%, 22% and 18%, respectively, to the rate of oxygen consumption. In contrast, protein synthesis is energetically inexpensive. We assess how these estimates of energy expenditure relate to brain energy use in vivo, and how they might differ in the mature brain.",0

A new analytic tool: self-consistently 'rotating' Holstein-Primakoff representation for the Cartesian components of the total spin, is proposed. Our approach enables, as a by-product, description of the second order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model without frustrating antiferromagnetic interaction, explored previously by other authors (Emary, Brandes 2003), but interpreted differently.

We assume that the effective frequency of the optical mode is much greater than those of the mechanical and the Bogoliubov modes of the movable mirror and the BEC. In the adiabatic approximation where the damping rate of the cavity is faster than those of the other modes, the system behaves as an effective two-mode model in which the atomic and mechanical modes are coupled to each other through the mediation of the optical field by an effective coupling parameter. We show that in the effective two-mode model, the LPN appears as a classical stochastic pump term which drives the amplitude quadratures of the mechanical and the Bogoliubov modes. It is also shown that a strong stationary mirror-atom entanglement can be established just in the dispersive and Doppler regimes where the two modes come into resonance with each other and the effect of the LPN gets very small.",0

The exchange and the correlation potentials among the electrons are described by using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The results of our study show that the electronic structure changes somewhat when CsI is doped with silver or thallium. The band gaps of CsI(Ag) and CsI(Tl) are smaller than that of CsI, and the width of the conduction band of CsI is increased when CsI is doped with thallium or silver.

We use a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph together with a deep multi-wavelength medium-resolution spectrum obtained with X-shooter (both on the Very Large Telescope) to perform a detailed analysis of the absorption lines from ionic, neutral atomic and molecular species in different excitation levels, as well as the broad-band dust extinction. We find that the absorber classifies as a Damped Lyman-alpha system (DLA) with logN(H i) (cm^-2) = 20.8 +- 0.1. The DLA has super-solar metallicity (Z ~ 2.5 Z_&#8857;, albeit to within a factor of two to three) with a depletion pattern typical of cold gas and an overall molecular fraction f = 2N(H_2)/(2N(H_2) + N(H i)) ~ 50%. This is the highest f-value observed to date in a high-z intervening system. Most of the molecular hydrogen arises from a clearly identified narrow (b ~ 0.7km s^-1), cold component in which carbon monoxide molecules are also found, with logN(CO)sim 15. With the help of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy, we study the chemical and physical conditions in the cold gas. We find that the line of sight probes the gas deep after the Hi-to-H_2 transition in a ~4-5 pc-size cloud with volumic density n_H ~ 80 cm^-3 and temperature of only 50 K. Our model suggests that the presence of small dust grains (down to about 0.001mum) and high cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_H ~ a few times 10^-15s^-1) are needed to explain the observed atomic and molecular abundances. The presence of small grains is also in agreement with the observed steep extinction curve that also features a 2175 A/ bump. Interestingly, the chemical and physical properties of this cloud are very similar to what is seen in diffuse molecular regions of the nearby Perseus complex, despite the former being observed when the Universe was only 2.5 Gyr old. The high excitation temperature of CO rotational levels towards J0000+0048 betrays however the higher temperature of the cosmic microwave background.

These measurements include characterization of the scintillation response for one hemisphere of proton recoil directions in each crystal. In addition to standard measurements of the total light output and pulse shape at each angle, the prompt and delayed light anisotropies are analyzed, allowing for investigation of the singlet and triplet molecular excitation behaviors independently. This work provides new quantitative and qualitative observations that make progress toward understanding the physical mechanisms behind the scintillation anisotropy. These measurements show that the relationship between the prompt and delayed light anisotropies is correlated with crystal structure, as it changes between the pi-stacked crystal structure materials (anthracene and p-terphenyl) and the herringbone crystal structure materials (stilbene, bibenzyl, and diphenylacetylene).

Here, we combine ideas from the theory of operator-valued kernels with delay-embedding techniques in dynamical systems to develop of a method for objective identification of spatiotemporal coherent patterns, without prior knowledge of the state space and/or the dynamical laws of the system generating the data. A key aspect of this method is that it operates on a space of vector-valued observables using a kernel measure of similarity that takes into account both temporal and spatial degrees of freedom (in contrast, classical kernel techniques such as PCA utilize aggregate measures of similarity between 'snapshots'). As a result, spectral decomposition of data via our approach yields a significantly more efficient and physically meaningful representation of complex spatiotemporal signals than conventional methods based on scalar-valued kernels.

The metric is able to detect non- linear causalities; to analyse both cross-sectional and longitudinal data sets; and to discriminate between real causalities and correlations caused by confounding factors. We validate the metric through synthetic data, dynamical and chaotic systems, and data representing the human brain activity in a cognitive task. We further show how the proposed metric is able to outperform classical causality metrics, provided non-linear relationships are present and large enough data sets are available.",0
101157,1,"A Bayesian view of Single-Qubit Clocks, and an Energy versus Accuracy tradeoff We bring a Bayesian approach to the analysis of clocks. Using exponential distributions as priors for clocks, we analyze how well one can keep time with a single qubit freely precessing under a magnetic field. We find that, at least with a single qubit, quantum mechanics does not allow exact timekeeping, in contrast to classical mechanics which does. We find the design of the single-qubit clock that leads to maximum accuracy. Further, we find an energy versus accuracy tradeoff --- the energy cost is at least $k_BT$ times the improvement in accuracy as measured by the entropy reduction in going from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution. We propose a physical realization of the single qubit clock using charge transport across a capacitively-coupled quantum dot.",0
101283,1,"Unifying decoherence and the Heisenberg Principle We exhibit three inequalities involving quantum measurement, all of which are sharp and state independent. The first inequality bounds the performance of joint measurement. The second quantifies the trade-off between the measurement quality and the disturbance caused on the measured system. Finally, the third inequality provides a sharp lower bound on the amount of decoherence in terms of the measurement quality. This gives a unified description of both the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the collapse of the wave function.",0

We study a very general model on the triangular lattice where spin-orbit coupling leads to the presence of highly anisotropic interactions. We use variational Monte Carlo to study both $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid states and ordered ones, via the Gutzwiller projected fermion construction. We thereby obtain the ground state phase diagram in this phase space. We furthermore consider effects beyond the Gutzwiller wavefunctions for the spinon Fermi surface quantum spin liquid, which are of particular importance when spin-orbit coupling is present.",0
101601,1,"Composing decoherence functionals Quantum measure theory (QMT) is a generalization of quantum theory where physical predictions are computed from a matrix known as the decoherence functional (DF). Previous works have noted that, in its original formulation, QMT exhibits a problem with composability, since the composition of two decoherence functionals is, in general, not a valid decoherence functional. This does not occur when the DFs in question happen to be positive semidefinite (a condition known as strong positivity). In this paper, we study the concept of composability of DFs and its consequences for QMT. Firstly, we show that the problem of composability is much deeper than originally envisaged, since, for any n, there exists a DF that can coexist with n−1 copies of itself, but not with n. Secondly, we prove that the set of strongly positive DFs cannot be enlarged while remaining closed under composition. Furthermore, any closed set of DFs containing all quantum DFs can only contain strongly positive DFs.",0

The process of scientific inference (the inverse problem) and prediction (the forward problem) involve multiple steps of data analysis, hypothesis formation, model construction, parameter estimation, model validation, and finally, the prediction of the quantity of interest. This article seeks to clarify the concepts of model inadequacy and bias, measurement uncertainty, and the two traditional classes of uncertainty: aleatoric versus epistemic, as well as their relationships with each other in the process of scientific inference. Starting from basic principles of probability, we build and explain a hierarchical Bayesian framework to quantitatively deal with model inadequacy and noise in data.

Open data and open-source software have enabled the rapid implementation of novel methods to manage and analyze the growing flood of data.

Although there are many dimensions to this issue, we believe that there is a lack of formalism used when describing end-to-end published results, from the data source to the analysis to the final published results. Even when authors do their best to make their research and data accessible, this lack of formalism reduces the clarity and efficiency of reporting, which contributes to issues of reproducibility.

This extends previous results to arbitrary dimension and arbitrary (constant) symplectic structure. As a by-product we introduce and prove several concepts and results on non-standard symplectic spaces which generalize those on the standard symplectic space, namely the symplectic spectrum, Williamson's theorem and Narcowich-Wigner spectra.

101871,1,"Automated Availability Statistics The availability of any large machine with users is not only of paramount importance but is also an oft quoted number, taken to represent the overall health of the facility, reflecting on the maintenance, operation, and engineering of the machine. The officially quoted availability is typically generated by hand after perusing the operation statistics over the time period in question. When humans are involved in such calculations there might be a subtle tendency to avoid the stigma of low availability or otherwise inflate performance. This could lead to skepticism at 'impossibly high' availability, as well as render the comparison of availability from one machine with another moot. We present here a method for calculating the machine availability automatically, based on the known machine states and the known alarm states of the machine. Although sufficient, in order to be accurate and useful, the method requires a perfect representation of all possible machine states and of all possible fatal alarms. As achieving perfection is an ongoing affair, the ability for a human to 'post-correct' the automated statistics is also described.",0
101879,1,"Multi-Fidelity Surrogate Based on Single Linear Regression Various frameworks have been proposed to predict mechanical system responses by combining data from different fidelities for design optimization and uncertainty quantification as reviewed by Fern\'andez-Godino et al. and Peherstorfer et al.. Among all frameworks, the Bayesian framework based on Gaussian processes has the potential of highest accuracy. However, the Bayesian framework requires optimization for estimating hyper-parameters, and there is a risk of estimating inappropriate hyper-parameters as Kriging surrogate often does, especially in the presence of noisy data. We propose an easy and yet powerful framework for practical design and applications. In this technical note, we revised a heuristic framework which minimizes the prediction errors at high-fidelity samples using optimization. The system behavior (high-fidelity behavior) is approximated by a linear combination of the low-fidelity predictions and a polynomial-based discrepancy function. The key idea is to consider the low-fidelity model as a basis function in the multi-fidelity model with the scale factor as a regression coefficient. The design matrix for least-square estimation consists of both the low-fidelity model and discrepancy function. Then the scale factor and coefficients of the basis functions are obtained simultaneously using linear regression, which guarantees the uniqueness of fitting process. Besides enabling efficient estimation of the parameters, the proposed least-squares multi-fidelity surrogate (LS-MFS) can be applicable to other regression models by simply replacing the design matrix. Therefore, the LS-MFS is expected to be easily applied to various applications such as prediction variance, D-optimal designs, uncertainty propagation and design optimization.",0

We prove that the energy attains a global constrained maximum at a family of particular stationary solutions which we call the ground state family. Using this fact and spectral properties of the linearized flow (which are interesting on their own due to a supersymmetric structure) we prove nonlinear orbital stability of the ground state family. The main difficulty in the proof is due to the degeneracy of the ground state family as a constrained maximizer of the energy.",0

Subsequently, we apply this methodology to real-world problems emerging across several disciplines including cases in neurobiology, finance and climate science.

102200,1,"Proposal of screening for diffuse low-grade gliomas in the population from 20 to 40 years Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGG) are cerebral tumors occurring in young adults, with an inescapable progression to higher grade of malignancy, resulting in functional impairment and death. DLGG evolve in several phases: an asymptomatic period despite a slow radiological growth; a period in which inauguralsymptoms occur, usually epilepsy with possible mild cognitive disorders; then a phase with malignant transformation generating disabling neurological deficits; and ultimately the terminal stage. Early maximal surgical resection significantly increases overall survival while preserving quality of life. Surgeries are conducted under local anesthesia in order to map neural networks crucial for brain functions, and with the goal to use neuroplasticity mechanisms by sparing cerebral connectivity. Adjuvant oncological treatments such as chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are kept for partial resection or non-operable recurrences. Because of an increase of incidentally discovered DLGG, explained by a facilitated accessto brain imaging, awake surgery has been proposed in asymptomatic patients, with the aim of maximizing the rate of total or even ""supratotal'' resection in smaller tumors.

102557,1,"Dimensional crossover of Bose-Einstein condensation phenomena in quantum gases confined within slab geometries We investigate systems of interacting bosonic particles confined within slablike boxes of size L2×Z with Z≪L, at their three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) transition temperature Tc, and below Tc where they experience a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition (at TBKT<Tc depending on the thickness Z). The low-temperature phase below TBKT shows quasi-long-range order: the planar correlations decay algebraically as predicted by the 2D spin-wave theory. This dimensional crossover, from a 3D behavior for T≳Tc to a quasi-2D critical behavior for T≲TBKT, can be described by a transverse finite-size scaling limit in a slab geometry. Numerical evidence of the 3D→2D dimensional crossover is presented for the Bose-Hubbard model defined in anisotropic L2×Z lattices with Z≪L. We extend this scaling analysis to the case the slab geometry of the gas is effectively realized by a transverse (inhomogeneous) harmonic trap. Finally, we discuss off-equilibrium behaviors arising from slow time variations of the temperature across the BEC transition of gases confined within a slab geometry. We argue that the system develops an off-equilibrium transverse finite-size scaling under these time-dependent protocols.",0

In part this has lowered the barriers to entry of exploring and monitoring larger areas of the earth's oceans. However, these advances have been mostly focused on autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) or shallow water autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). One of the main drivers for high cost in the deep water domain is the challenge of localizing such vehicles using acoustics.

103149,1,"Open or Closed? Information Flow Decided by Transfer Operators and Forecastability Quality Metric A basic systems question concerns the concept of closure, meaning autonomomy (closed) in the sense of describing the (sub)system as fully consistent within itself. Alternatively, the system may be nonautonomous (open) meaning it receives influence from an outside coupling subsystem. Information flow, and related causation inference, are tenant on this simple concept. We take the perspective of Weiner-Granger causality, descriptive of a subsystem forecast quality dependence on considering states of another subsystem. Here we develop a new direct analytic discussion, rather than a data oriented approach. That is, we refer to the underlying Frobenius-Perron transfer operator that moderates evolution of densities of ensembles of orbits, and two alternative forms of the restricted Frobenius-Perron (FP) operator, interpreted as if either closed (determinstic FP) or not closed (the unaccounted outside influence seems stochastic and correspondingly the stochastic FP operator). From this follows contrasting the kernels of the variants of the operators, as if densities in their own rights. However, the corresponding differential entropy to compare by Kulback-Leibler divergence, as one would when leading to transfer entropy, becomes ill-defined. Instead we build our Forecastability Quality Metric (FQM) upon the ""symmetrized"" variant known as Jensen-Shanon divergence, and also we are able to point out several useful resulting properties that result. We illustrate the FQM by a simple coupled chaotic system. For now, this analysis is a new theoretical direction, but we describe data oriented directions for the future.",0
103240,1,"Incoherent population mixing contributions to phase-modulation two-dimensional coherent excitation spectra We present theoretical and experimental results showing the effects of incoherent population mixing on two-dimensional (2D) coherent excitation spectra that are measured via a time-integrated population and phase-sensitive detection. The technique uses four collinear ultrashort pulses and phase modulation to acquire two-dimensional spectra by isolating specific nonlinear contributions to the photoluminescence or photocurrent excitation signal. We demonstrate that an incoherent contribution to the measured lineshape, arising from nonlinear population dynamics over the entire photoexcitation lifetime, generates a similar lineshape to the expected 2D coherent spectra in condensed-phase systems. In those systems, photoexcitations are mobile such that inter-particle interactions are important on any timescale, including those long compared to the 2D coherent experiment. Measurements on a semicrystalline polymeric semiconductor film at low temperature show that, in some conditions in which multi-exciton interactions are suppressed, the technique predominantly detects coherent signal and can be used, in our example, to extract homogeneous linewidths. The same method used on a lead-halide perovskite photovoltaic cell shows that incoherent population mixing of mobile photocarriers can dominate the measured signal since carrier-carrier bimolecular scattering is active even at low excitation densities, which hides the coherent contribution to the spectral lineshape.",0

Considering the qubit comprising the lowest two vibrational energy eigenstates of the impurity, we demonstrate that its dynamics probes the equilibrium density fluctuations encoded in the dynamic structure factor of the superfluid. Observing the impurity's evolution is thus shown to facilitate nondestructive measurements of the superfluid order parameter and the contact between collective and single-particle excitation spectra.

103786,1,"Deep Packet/Flow Analysis using GPUs Deep packet inspection (DPI) faces severe performance challenges in high-speed networks (40/100 GE) as it requires a large amount of raw computing power and high I/O throughputs. Recently, researchers have tentatively used GPUs to address the above issues and boost the performance of DPI. Typically, DPI applications involve highly complex operations in both per-packet and per-flow data level, often in real-time. The parallel architecture of GPUs fits exceptionally well for per-packet network traffic processing. However, for stateful network protocols such as TCP, their data stream need to be reconstructed in a per-flow level to deliver a consistent content analysis. Since the flow-centric operations are naturally antiparallel and often require large memory space for buffering out-of-sequence packets, they can be problematic for GPUs, whose memory is normally limited to several gigabytes. In this work, we present a highly efficient GPU-based deep packet/flow analysis framework. The proposed design includes a purely GPU-implemented flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly. Instead of buffering and waiting for TCP packets to become in sequence, our framework process the packets in batch and uses a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) with prefix-/suffix- tree method to detect patterns across out-of-sequence packets that happen to be located in different batches. Evaluation shows that our code can reassemble and forward tens of millions of packets per second and conduct a stateful signature-based deep packet inspection at 55 Gbit/s using an NVIDIA K40 GPU.",0

104215,1,"On the Study of Chaos and Memory Effects in the Bonhoeffer-van der Pol Oscillator with a Non-Ideal Capacitor In this paper, the voltage fluctuations of the Bonhoeffer van der pol oscillator system with a non-ideal capacitor were investigated. Here, the capacitor was modeled, using a fractional differential equation in which the order of the fractional derivative is also a measure of the memory in the dielectric. The governing fractional differential equation was derived using two methods, namely a differential and integral approach. The former method utilized a hierarchical resistor-capacitor (RC) ladder model while the latter utilized the theory of the universal dielectric-response. The dynamical behavior of the potential across the capacitor was found to be affected by this parameter, and, therefore, the memory of the system. Additionally, findings indicate that an increase in the memory parameter was associated with an increase in the energy stored in the dielectric. It was found that oscillation death resulted in a higher amount of stored energy in the dielectric over time, as compared to behavior, which displayed relaxation oscillations or chaotic fluctuations. The relatively-lower stored energy resulting from the latter types of dynamical behavior appeared to be a consequence of the memory effect, where present accumulations of energy in the capacitor are affected by previous decreases in the potential. Hence, in this type of scenario, the dielectric material can be thought of as remembering the past behavior of the voltage, which leads to either a decrease, or an enhancement in the stored energy. The non-ideal capacitor was also found to have a transitory nature, where it behaves more like a resistor as {\alpha} approaches 0, and conversely, more like a capacitor as {\alpha} goes to 1. Here, a decrease in {\alpha} was linked to an enhanced metallic character of the dielectric.",0

104580,1,"An algorithm to increase the residues of wrapped-phase in spatial domain In phase unwrapping, the locations and densities of residues are indicative of the severity of the unwrapping problem. The residues are used to detect and evade inconsistent phase areas. Gdeisat et al. proposed an algorithm to increase the number of residues in a wrapped-phase map to improve the results of phase unwrapping. But this method will take much time to make the Fourier transform, inverse Fourier transform, select and shift the spectral components, and there is no theoretical analysis on why the frequency shift can increase the number of residues. In view of the above problems, we proposed an algorithm to increase the number of residues in a wrapped-phase map, which only uses a simple multiply operation in spatial domain to realize frequency shift by taking advantage of the frequency shift property of Fourier transform. Besides that, we discuss the relationship between the number of residues and frequency shift. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted to prove the validity of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can speed up more than 50%.",0
104711,1,"Addition and removal energies of circular quantum dots We present and compare several many-body methods as applied to two-dimensional quantum dots with circular symmetry. We calculate the approximate ground state energy using a harmonic oscillator basis optimized by Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and further improve the ground state energy using two post-HF methods: in-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG) and coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD). With the application of quasidegenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) or the equations-of-motion (EOM) method to the results of the previous two methods, we obtain addition and removal energies as well. Our results are benchmarked against full configuration interaction (FCI) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) where available. We examine the rate of convergence and perform extrapolations to the infinite basis limit using a power-law model.",0
104758,1,"Percolation thresholds of two-dimensional continuum systems of rectangles [with erratum] The present work introduces an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for continuum percolation composed of randomly-oriented rectangles. By conducting extensive simulations, we report high precision percolation thresholds for a variety of homogeneous systems with different rectangle aspect ratios. This work verifies and extends the excluded area theory. It is confirmed that percolation thresholds are dominated by the average excluded areas for both homogeneous and heterogeneous rectangle systems (except for some special heterogeneous systems where the rectangle lengths differ too much from one another). In terms of the excluded areas, generalized formulae are proposed to effectively predict precise percolation thresholds for all these rectangle systems. This work is therefore helpful for both practical applications and theoretical studies concerning relevant systems. The Erratum addresses errors in our earlier paper ""Percolation thresholds of two-dimensional continuum systems of rectangles"" published in [Phys. Rev. E 88, 012101 (2013)].",0
104806,1,"Response of the Higgs amplitude mode of superfluid Bose gases in a three-dimensional optical lattice We study the Higgs mode of superfluid Bose gases in a three-dimensional optical lattice, which emerges near the quantum phase transition to the Mott insulator at commensurate fillings. Specifically, we consider responses of the Higgs mode to temporal modulations of the onsite interaction and the hopping energy. In order to calculate the response functions including the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations, we map the Bose-Hubbard model onto an effective pseudospin-1 model and use a perturbative expansion based on the imaginary-time Green's function theory. We also include the effects of an inhomogeneous trapping potential by means of a local density approximation. We find that the response function for the hopping modulation is equal to that for the interaction modulation within our approximation. At the unit filling rate and in the absence of a trapping potential, we show that the Higgs mode can exist as a sharp resonance peak in the dynamical susceptibilities at typical temperatures. However, the resonance peak is significantly broadened due to the trapping potential when the modulations are applied globally to the entire system. We suggest that the Higgs mode can be detected as a sharp resonance peak by partial modulations around the trap center.",0
104923,1,"Fast C-V method to mitigate effects of deep levels in CIGS doping profiles In this work, methods to determine more accurate doping profiles in semiconductors is explored where trap-induced artifacts such as hysteresis and doping artifacts are observed. Specifically in CIGS, it is shown that this fast capacitance-voltage (C-V) approach presented here allows for accurate doping profile measurement even at room temperature, which is typically not possible due to the large ratio of trap concentration to doping. Using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurement, the deep trap responsible for the abnormal C-V measurement above 200 K is identified. Importantly, this fast C-V can be used for fast evaluation on the production line to monitor the true doping concentration, and even estimate the trap concentration. Additionally, the influence of high conductance on the apparent doping profile at different temperature is investigated.",0

A hybrid number is a number created with any combination of the complex, hyperbolic and dual numbers satisfying the relation $\mathbf { ih=-hi=i}+\varvec{\varepsilon }.$ Because these numbers are a composition of dual, complex and hyperbolic numbers, we think that it would be better to call them hybrid numbers instead of the generalized complex numbers. In this paper, we give some algebraic and geometric properties of this number set with some classifications. In addition, we examined the roots of a hybrid number according to its type and character.",0

Our method applies equally to stochastic and deterministic time series data (with no prior knowledge required of the nature of the data) and relies on one realisation (ie one sample path) of the process. Linear drift effects are automatically removed without any preprocessing. We show numerical results for time series constructed from i.i.d. α-stable random variables and from deterministic weakly chaotic maps.

105650,1,"New solar metallicity measurements In the past years, a systematic downward revision of the metallicity of the Sun has led to the ""solar modelling problem"", namely the disagreement between predictions of standard solar models and inferences from helioseismology. Recent solar wind measurements of the metallicity of the Sun, however, provide once more indication for a high-metallicity Sun. Because of the effects of possible residual fractionation, the derived value of the metallicity Z$\circledcirc$ = 0.0196$\pm$0.0014 actually represents a lower limit to the true metallicity of Sun. However, when compared with helioseismological measurements, solar models computed using these new abundances fail to restore agreement, owing to the implausibly high abundance of refractory (Mg, Si, S, Fe) elements, which correlates with a higher core temperature and hence an over-production of solar neutrinos. Moreover, the robustness of these measurements is challenged by possible first ionization potential fractionation processes. In this talk I will discuss these solar wind measurements, which leave the ""solar modelling problem"" unsolved.",0

It's existence proves that the circular orbit is stable in the sense of Lyapunov.

We obtained the energy eigenvalues and the total normalized wave function. We employed Hellmann-Feynman Theorem (HFT) to compute expectation values , , , and for four different diatomic molecules: hydrogen molecule (H2), lithium hydride molecule (LiH), hydrogen chloride molecule (HCl), and carbon (II) oxide molecule. The resulting energy equation reduces to three well-known potentials which are as follows: Hulthen potential, Yukawa potential, and inversely quadratic potential. The bound state energies for Hulthen and Yukawa potentials agree with the result reported in existing literature. We obtained the numerical bound state energies of the expectation values by implementing MATLAB algorithm using experimentally determined spectroscopic constant for the different diatomic molecules.

105929,1,"Prediction of flow dynamics using point processes Describing a time series parsimoniously is the first step to study the underlying dynamics. For a time-discrete system, a generating partition provides a compact description such that a time series and a symbolic sequence are one-to-one. But, for a time-continuous system, such a compact description does not have a solid basis. Here, we propose to describe a time-continuous time series using a local cross section and the times when the orbit crosses the local cross section. We show that if such a series of crossing times and some past observations are given, we can predict the system's dynamics with fine accuracy. This reconstructability neither depends strongly on the size nor the placement of the local cross section if we have a sufficiently long database. We demonstrate the proposed method using the Lorenz model as well as the actual measurement of wind speed.",0

106632,1,"Emerging importance of chemokine receptor CXCR3 and its ligands in cardiovascular diseases The CXC chemokines, CXCL4, -9, -10, -11, CXCL4L1, and the CC chemokine CCL21, activate CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), a cell-surface G protein-coupled receptor expressed mainly by Th1 cells, cytotoxic T (Tc) cells and NK cells that have a key role in immunity and inflammation. However, CXCR3 is also expressed by vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and appears to be important in controlling physiological vascular function. In the last decade, evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies has revealed the participation of CXCR3 and its ligands in multiple cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) of different aetiologies including atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, as well as in heart transplant rejection and transplant coronary artery disease (CAD). CXCR3 ligands have also proven to be valid biomarkers for the development of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, suggesting an underlining pathophysiological relation between levels of these chemokines and the development of adverse cardiac remodelling. The observation that several of the above-mentioned chemokines exert biological actions independent of CXCR3 provides both opportunities and challenges for developing effective drug strategies. In this review, we provide evidence to support our contention that CXCR3 and its ligands actively participate in the development and progression of CVDs, and may additionally have utility as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.",0
106652,1,"Observation of a phononic quadrupole topological insulator The modern theory of charge polarization in solids is based on a generalization of Berry's phase. Its quantization lies at the heart of our understanding of all systems with topological band structures that were discovered over the last decades. These include the quantum Hall effect, time-reversal invariant topological insulators in two and three dimensions as well as Weyl semi-metals. Recently, the theory of this quantized polarization was extended from the dipole- to higher multipole-moments. In particular, a two-dimensional quantized quadrupole insulator is predicted to have gapped yet topological one-dimensional edge-modes, which in turn stabilize zero-dimensional in-gap corner states. However, such a state of matter has not been observed experimentally. Here, we provide the first measurements of a phononic quadrupole insulator. We experimentally characterize the bulk, edge, and corner physics of a mechanical metamaterial and find the predicted gapped edge and in-gap corner states. We further corroborate our findings by comparing the mechanical properties of a topologically non-trivial system to samples in other phases predicted by the quadrupole theory. From an application point of view, these topological corner states are an important stepping stone on the way to topologically protected wave-guides in higher dimensions and thereby open a new design path for metamaterials.",0
106807,1,"Multifractal surrogate-data generation algorithm that preserves pointwise Hölder regularity structure, with initial applications to turbulence An algorithm is described that can generate random variants of a time series while preserving the probability distribution of original values and the pointwise Hölder regularity. Thus, it preserves the multifractal properties of the data. Our algorithm is similar in principle to well-known algorithms based on the preservation of the Fourier amplitude spectrum and original values of a time series. However, it is underpinned by a dual-tree complex wavelet transform rather than a Fourier transform. Our method, which we term the iterated amplitude adjusted wavelet transform can be used to generate bootstrapped versions of multifractal data, and because it preserves the pointwise Hölder regularity but not the local Hölder regularity, it can be used to test hypotheses concerning the presence of oscillating singularities in a time series, an important feature of turbulence and econophysics data. Because the locations of the data values are randomized with respect to the multifractal structure, hypotheses about their mutual coupling can be tested, which is important for the velocity-intermittency structure of turbulence and self-regulating processes.",0

We show that this proposal is realized when one subsystem only contains one qubit and a quantum state is a linear combination of two product states. We also use a toric code model with smooth and rough boundary conditions on a cylinder manifold and a disk manifold with holes to show that a choice of a generalized concurrence of a pure state depends on boundary degrees of freedom of a Hilbert space. A relation of a generalized concurrence of a pure state and maximum violation of Bell's inequality is also demonstrated in a $2n$-qubit state.

107333,1,"Nanoscale thermal imaging of dissipation in quantum systems Energy dissipation is a fundamental process governing the dynamics of physical, chemical, and biological systems. It is also one of the main characteristics distinguishing quantum and classical phenomena. In condensed matter physics, in particular, scattering mechanisms, loss of quantum information, or breakdown of topological protection are deeply rooted in the intricate details of how and where the dissipation occurs. Despite its vital importance the microscopic behavior of a system is usually not formulated in terms of dissipation because the latter is not a readily measureable quantity on the microscale. Although nanoscale thermometry is gaining much recent interest, the existing thermal imaging methods lack the necessary sensitivity and are unsuitable for low temperature operation required for study of quantum systems. Here we report a superconducting quantum interference nano-thermometer device with sub 50 nm diameter that resides at the apex of a sharp pipette and provides scanning cryogenic thermal sensing with four orders of magnitude improved thermal sensitivity of below 1 {\mu}K/Hz1/2. The non-contact non-invasive thermometry allows thermal imaging of very low nanoscale energy dissipation down to the fundamental Landauer limit of 40 fW for continuous readout of a single qubit at 1 GHz at 4.2 K. These advances enable observation of dissipation due to single electron charging of individual quantum dots in carbon nanotubes and reveal a novel dissipation mechanism due to resonant localized states in hBN encapsulated graphene, opening the door to direct imaging of nanoscale dissipation processes in quantum matter.",0

Analysis of state standards put into place between 1990 and 2010 find that most states directed teachers to deemphasize both memorization and student practice in computational problem solving. Available state test score data show a significant decline in student computation skills. In recent international testing, scores for US 16 to 24 year olds in numeracy finished last among 22 tested nations in the OECD.

Our re-reduced, flux calibrated X-SHOOTER spectra of CR7 reveal a tentative detection of HeII with F(HeII)=$(1.8\pm0.7)\times10^{-17}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ and we identify the signal (~2.6$\sigma$) as coming only from observations obtained along the major axis of Lya emission. There is a change of +0.2-0.5mag in UltraVISTA J band data for CR7 from DR2 to DR3, which virtually eliminates the strong J-band excess previously interpreted as being caused by HeII. Our WFC3 grism spectra provide a significant detection of the UV continuum of CR7's clump A, yielding an excellent fit to a power law with $\beta=-2.4\pm0.4$ and $M_{UV}=-21.7\pm0.3$, consistent with no variability. HST grism data fail to detect any rest-frame UV line in clump A above 3$\sigma$, yielding F(HeII)<$0.5\times10^{-17}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ (EW$_0$<10A) at a 95% confidence level. Clump C is tentatively identified as a potential variable and high ionisation source with F(HeII)=$(1.0\pm0.4)\times10^{-17}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$. We perform CLOUDY modelling to constrain the metallicity and the ionising nature of CR7, and also make emission-line predictions for JWST/NIRSpec. CR7 seems to be actively forming stars without any clear AGN activity in clumps A and B, consistent with a metallicity of ~0.05-0.2 Z$_{\odot}$ and with component A experiencing the most massive starburst.

107935,1,"Numerical Evidence for Thermally Induced Monopoles Electrical charges are conserved. The same would be expected to hold for magnetic charges, yet magnetic monopoles have never been observed. It is therefore surprising that the laws of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, combined with Maxwell's equations, suggest that colloidal particles heated or cooled in certain polar or paramagnetic solvents may behave as if they carry an electrical/magnetic charge [J. Phys. Chem. B $\textbf{120}$, 5987 (2016)]. Here we present numerical simulations that show that the field distribution around a pair of such heated/cooled colloidal particles agrees quantitatively with the theoretical predictions for a pair of oppositely charged electrical or magnetic monopoles. However, in other respects, the non-equilibrium colloids do not behave as monopoles: they cannot be moved by a homogeneous applied field. The numerical evidence for the monopole-like fields around heated/cooled colloids is crucial because the experimental and numerical determination of forces between such colloids would be complicated by the presence of other effects, such as thermophoresis.",0
107966,1,"Time-reversed magnetically controlled perturbation (TRMCP) optical focusing inside scattering media Manipulating and focusing light deep inside biological tissue and tissue-like complex media has been desired for long yet considered challenging. One feasible strategy is through optical wavefront engineering, where the optical scattering-induced phase distortions are time reversed or pre-compensated so that photons travel along different optical paths interfere constructively at the targeted position within a scattering medium. To define the targeted position, an internal guidestar is needed to guide or provide a feedback for wavefront engineering. It could be injected or embedded probes such as fluorescence or nonlinear microspheres, ultrasonic modulation, as well as absorption perturbation. Here we propose to use a magnetically controlled optical absorbing microsphere as the internal guidestar. Using a digital optical phase conjugation system, we obtained sharp optical focusing within scattering media through time-reversing the scattered light perturbed by the magnetic microsphere. Since the object is magnetically controlled, dynamic optical focusing is allowed with a relatively large field-of-view by scanning the magnetic field externally. Moreover, the magnetic microsphere can be packaged with an organic membrane, using biological or chemical means to serve as a carrier. Therefore, the technique may find particular applications for enhanced targeted drug delivery, and imaging and photoablation of angiogenic vessels in tumours.",0

In these networks, the coupling strength between two nodes depends on their distance and is modulated by a parameter $\sigma$. We find that, in the thermodynamic limit, ergodicity is lost and the ""distant"" nodes can not be reached. Moreover, for finite-sized systems, there exists a threshold value for $\sigma$ such that, when $\sigma$ is relatively large, the inhomogeneity of the coupling pattern prevails and ""distant"" nodes are hardly reached. The same analysis is carried on also for generic hierarchical graphs, where interactions are meant to involve $p$-plets ($p>2$) of nodes, finding that ergodicity is still broken in the thermodynamic limit, but no threshold value for $\sigma$ is evidenced, ultimately due to a slow growth of the network diameter with the size.",0
108417,1,"Magnetic disorder in superconductors: Enhancement by mesoscopic fluctuations We study the density of states (DOS) and the transition temperature Tc in a dirty superconducting film with rare classical magnetic impurities of an arbitrary strength described by the Poissonian statistics. We take into account that the potential disorder is a source of mesoscopic fluctuations of the local DOS, and, consequently, of the effective strength of magnetic impurities. We find that these mesoscopic fluctuations result in a nonzero DOS for all energies in the region of the phase diagram where without this effect the DOS is zero within the standard mean-field theory. This mechanism can be more efficient in filling the mean-field superconducting gap than rare fluctuations of the potential disorder (instantons). Depending on the magnetic impurity strength, the suppression of Tc by spin-flip scattering can be faster or slower than in the standard mean-field theory.",0

Here we develop a theory to compute the profile of sequential visibility graph motifs in the context of natural visibility graphs (VGs). This theory gives exact results for deterministic aperiodic processes with a smooth invariant density or stochastic processes that fulfill the Markov property and have a continuous marginal distribution. The framework also allows for a linear time numerical estimation in the case of empirical time series. A comparison between the HVG and the VG case (including evaluation of their robustness for short series polluted with measurement noise) is also presented.,0
108892,1,"A New Tracking Algorithm for Multiple Colloidal Particles Close to Contact In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on radial symmetry center method to track colloidal particles close to contact, where the optical images of the particles start to overlap in digital video microscopy. This overlapping effect is important to observe the pair interaction potential in colloidal studies and it appears as additional interaction in the measurement of the interaction with conventional tracking analysis. The proposed algorithm in this work is simple, fast and applicable for not only two particles but also three and more particles without any modification. The algorithm uses gradient vectors of the particle intensity distribution, which allows us to use a part of the symmetric intensity distribution in the calculation of the actual particle position. In this study, simulations are performed to see the performance of the proposed algorithm for two and three particles, where the simulation images are generated by using fitted curve to experimental particle image for different sized particles. As a result, the algorithm yields the maximum error smaller than 2 nm for 5.53 {\mu}m silica particles in contact condition.",0
108901,1,"Geometric influences of a particle confined to a curved surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space In the spirit of the thin-layer quantization approach, we give the formula of the geometric influences of a particle confined to a curved surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The geometric contributions can result from the reduced commutation relation between the acted function depending on normal variable and the normal derivative. According to the formula, we obtain the geometric potential, geometric momentum, geometric orbital angular momentum, geometric linear Rashba, and cubic Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. As an example, a truncated cone surface is considered. We find that the geometric orbital angular momentum can provide an azimuthal polarization for spin, and the sign of the geometric Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling can be flipped through the inclination angle of generatrix.",0
108931,1,"A robust and passive method for geometric calibration of large arrays This paper presents a complete strategy for the geometry estimation of large microphone arrays of arbitrary shape. Largeness is intended here in both number of microphones (hundreds) and size (few meters). Such arrays can be used for various applications in open or confined spaces like acoustical imaging, source identification, or speech processing. For so large array systems,measuring the geometry by hand is impractical. Therefore a blind passive method is proposed. It is based on the analysis of the background acoustic noise, supposed to be a diffuse field. The proposed strategy is a two-step process. First the pairwise microphone distances are identified by matching their measured coherence function to the one predicted by the diffuse field theory. Second, a robust multidimensional scaling(MDS) algorithm is adapted and implemented. It takes advantage of local characteristics to reduce the set of distances and infer the geometry of the array. This work is an extension of previous studies, and it overcomes unsolved drawbacks. In particular it deals efficiently with the outliers known to ruin standard MDS algorithms. Experimental proofs of this ability are presented by treating the case of two arrays. They show that the proposed improvements manage large spatial arrays.",0
108962,1,"Minimum Rate Sampling and Spectrum Blind Reconstruction in Random Equivalent Sampling The random equivalent sampling (RES) is a well-known sampling technique that can be used to capture a high-speed repetitive waveform with low sampling rate. In this paper, the feasibility of spectrum-blind multiband signal reconstruction for data sampled from RES is investigated. We propose a RES sampling pattern and its corresponding mathematical model that guarantees well-conditioned reconstruction of multiband signal with unknown spectral support. We give the minimum number of RES acquisitions that hold overwhelming probability to successfully reconstruct original signal. We demonstrate that for signal with specific spectral occupation, the number of RES acquisitions and the minimum sampling rate could be approached. The signal reconstruction is studied in the framework of compressive sampling (CS) theory. The eigen-decomposition and minimum description length (MDL) criteria are adopted to adaptively estimate the dimension of signal, and the number of unknowns of reconstruction problem is reduced. Experimental results are reported to indicate that, for a spectrum-blind sparse multiband signal, the proposed reconstruction algorithm for RES is feasible and robust.",0
109206,1,"The Class of Jsolated stars We suggest that stars whose angular momentum (J) does not increase by a companion, star or planet, along their post-main sequence evolution have much lower mass loss rates along their giant branches. Their classification to a separate group can bring insight on their late evolution stages. We term these J isolated stars, or Jsolated stars. We argue that the mass loss rate of Jsolated stars is poorly determined because the mass loss rate expressions on the giant branches are empirically based mainly on stars that experience strong binary interaction, with stellar or sub-stellar companions, e.g., planetary nebula (PN) progenitors. We postulate that the average mass loss rate of Jsolated stars during their giant phases is much lower than of non-Jsolated stars. We explore some aspects of this assumption and find that such stars with an initial mass Mi~1-2Mo reach higher luminosities and radii on the upper asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and hence are more likely to swallow brown dwarfs and planets during the AGB than traditional calculations predict. This might lead to the formation of elliptical PNe and account for bright PNe in old stellar populations. We also find that under our assumption the Sun, a Jsolated star, will most likely swallow the Earth during the AGB phase.",0
109284,1,"Nonlinear Phenomena of Ultracold Atomic Gases in Optical Lattices: Emergence of Novel Features in Extended States The system of a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice is governed by two factors: nonlinearity originating from the interparticle interaction, and the periodicity of the system set by the lattice. The high level of controllability associated with such an arrangement allows for the study of the competition and interplay between these two, and gives rise to a whole range of interesting and rich nonlinear effects. This review covers the basic idea and overview of such nonlinear phenomena, especially those corresponding to extended states.

We explicitly demonstrate the appearance of a hysteresis loop with various quench times, showing that it is rate independent for large magnetizations only. In other cases, scaling of the hysteresis loop area is observed, which we explain by using the Kibble-Zurek theory in the limit of small magnetization. The effect of an external harmonic trapping potential is also discussed.",0
109499,1,"Magnification relations of quad lenses and applications on Einstein crosses In this work, we mainly study the magnification relations of quad lens models for cusp, fold and cross configurations. By dividing and ray-tracing in different image regions, we numerically derive the positions and magnifications of the four images for a point source lying inside of the astroid caustic. Then, based on the magnifications, we calculate the signed cusp and fold relations for the singular isothermal elliptical lenses. The signed fold relation map has positive and negative regions, and the positive region is usually larger than the negative region as has been confirmed before. It can also explain that for many observed fold image pairs, the fluxes of the Fermat minimum images are apt to be larger than those of the saddle images. We define a new quantity cross relation R_cross which describes the magnification discrepancy between two minimum images and two saddle images. Distance ratio d_sadd/d_mini is also defined as the ratio of the distance of two saddle images to that of two minimum images. We calculate the cross relations and distance ratios for nine observed Einstein crosses. In theory, for most of the quad lens models, the cross relations decrease as the distance ratios increase. In observation, the cross relations of the nine samples do not agree with the quad lens models very well, nevertheless, the cross relations of the nine samples do not give obvious evidence for anomalous flux ratio as the cusp and fold types do. Then, we discuss several reasons for the disagreement, and expect good consistencies for more precise observations and better lens models in the future.",0
109505,1,"Dynamical Casimir Effect for Gaussian Boson Sampling We show that the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE), realized on two multimode coplanar waveg-uide resonators, implements a gaussian boson sampler (GBS). The appropriate choice of the mirror acceleration that couples both resonators translates into the desired initial gaussian state and many-boson interference in a boson sampling network. In particular, we show that the proposed quantum simulator naturally performs a classically hard task, known as scattershot boson sampling. Our result unveils an unprecedented computational power of DCE, and paves the way for using DCE as a resource for quantum simulation.",0

We compare predictions of the one-dimensional spectra, based on approaches already proposed in the literature. Employing the methods of free random variables and diagrammatic techniques, we solve a general random matrix problem, namely the spectrum of a matrix $\frac{1}{T}XA{{X}^{\dagger}}$ , where X is an $N\times T$ Gaussian random matrix and A is any $T\times T$ , not necessarily symmetric (Hermitian) matrix. Using this result, we study the spectral features of the large lagged correlation matrices as a function of the depth of the time-lag. We also analyze the properties of left and right eigenvector correlations for the time-lagged matrices. We positively verify our results by the numerical simulations.",0

Our purpose in this investigation is threefold: (i) to compare the abundances of HII regions and planetary nebulae in each system in order to investigate the differences derived from the age and origin of these objects, (ii) to compare the chemical evolution in different systems, such as the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, and other galaxies of the Local Group, and (iii) to investigate to what extent the nucleosynthesis contributions from the progenitor stars affect the observed abundances in planetary nebulae, especially for oxygen and neon, which places constraints on the amount of these elements that can be produced by intermediate mass stars.",0
110186,1,"Characters for Complex Bundles and their Connections The paper combines several fortunate mini miracles to achieve its two objectives. These were woven together in a several year's effort to answer a question raised by Iz Singer a decade ago. Our answer is accessible to the topologist, to the differential geometer and to the analyst who appreciates the statement of the Index theorem of Atiyah,Patodi,Singer for manifolds with boundary. The mini miracles are these: a] The Conner Floyd miracle that complex bordism tensored over the Todd genus and the Bott miracle that stable complex vector bundles respectively satisfy the axioms of a generalized homology theory and of a generalized cohomology theory. b] That these theories, with the covariant and contravariant geometric representations indicated, stably almost complex (SAC) manifolds modulo product relations and stable complex bundles, are not only related by Alexander duality but they are also related by Pontryagin duality. c] The abstract corollary of b] that stable complex bundles have a complete system of numerical invariants and that these can be computed by integrals of chern weil characteristic forms over manifolds with boundary reduced modulo integers, thanks to the APS Index Theorem. d] The adiabatic limit argument of the appendix to the last section showing a direct sum connection on the total space of a riemannian family of Riemannian manifolds with connection is Chern Simons equivalent in the limit to the Levi Civita connection of the direct sum metric.

110304,1,"Stellar mass functions and implications for a variable IMF Spatially resolved kinematics of nearby galaxies has shown that the ratio of dynamical- to stellar population-based estimates of the mass of a galaxy ($M_*^{\rm JAM}/M_*$) correlates with $\sigma_e$, if $M_*$ is estimated using the same IMF for all galaxies and the stellar M/L ratio within each galaxy is constant. This correlation may indicate that, in fact, the IMF is more dwarf-rich for galaxies with large $\sigma$. We use this correlation to estimate a dynamical or IMF-corrected stellar mass, $M_*^{\rm \alpha_{JAM}}$, from $M_{*}$ and $\sigma_e$ for a sample of $6 \times 10^5$ SDSS galaxies for which spatially resolved kinematics is not available. We also compute the `virial' mass estimate $k(n,R)\,R_e\,\sigma_R^2/G$, where $n$ is the Sersic index, in the SDSS and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ samples. We show that an $n$-dependent correction must be applied to the $k(n,R)$ values provided by Prugniel & Simien (1997). Our analysis also shows that the shape of the velocity dispersion profile in the ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ sample varies weakly with $n$: $(\sigma_R/\sigma_e) = (R/R_e)^{-\gamma(n)}$. The resulting stellar mass functions, based on $M_*^{\rm \alpha_{JAM}}$ and the recalibrated virial mass, are in good agreement. If the $M_*^{\rm \alpha_{JAM}}/M_* - \sigma_e$ correlation is indeed due to the IMF, and stellar M/L gradients can be ignored, then our $\phi(M_*^{\rm \alpha_{JAM}})$ is an estimate of the stellar mass function in which $\sigma_e$-dependent variations in the IMF across the population have been accounted for. Using a Fundamental Plane based observational proxy for $\sigma_e$ produces comparable results. By demonstrating that cheaper proxies are sufficiently accurate, our analysis should enable a more reliable census of the mass in stars for large galaxy samples, at a fraction of the cost. Our results are provided in tabular form.",0

110475,1,"A Pattern Recognition Approach to Transistor Array Parameter Variance The properties of semiconductor devices, including bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), are known to vary substantially in terms of their parameters. In this work, an experimental approach, including pattern recognition concepts and methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), was used to experimentally investigate the variation among BJTs belonging to integrated circuits known as transistor arrays. It was shown that a good deal of the devices variance can be captured using only two PCA axes. It was also verified that, though substantially small variation of parameters is observed for BJT from the same array, larger variation arises between BJTs from distinct arrays, suggesting the consideration of device characteristics in more critical analog designs. As a consequence of its supervised nature, LDA was able to provide a substantial separation of the BJT into clusters, corresponding to each transistor array. In addition, the LDA mapping into two dimensions revealed a clear relationship between the considered measurements. Interestingly, a specific mapping suggested by the PCA, involving the total harmonic distortion variation expressed in terms of the average voltage gain, yielded an even better separation between the transistor array clusters. All in all, this work yielded interesting results from both semiconductor engineering and pattern recognition perspectives.",0
110497,1,"$r$-Tuple Error Functions and Indefinite Theta Series of Higher-Depth Theta functions for definite signature lattices constitute a rich source of modular forms. A natural question is then their generalization to indefinite signature lattices. One way to ensure a convergent theta series while keeping the holomorphicity property of definite signature theta series is to restrict the sum over lattice points to a proper subset. Although such series do not have the modular properties that a definite signature theta function has, as shown by Zwegers for signature $(1,n-1)$ lattices, they can be completed to a function that has these modular properties by compromising on the holomorphicity property in a certain way. This construction has recently been generalized to signature $(2,n-2)$ lattices by Alexandrov, Banerjee, Manschot, and Pioline. A crucial ingredient in this work is the notion of double error functions which naturally lends itself to generalizations to higher dimensions. In this work we study the properties of such higher dimensional error functions which we will call $r$-tuple error functions. We then construct an indefinite theta series for signature $(r,n-r)$ lattices and show they can be completed to modular forms by using these $r$-tuple error functions.",0

111002,1,"On the hydrodynamics of Bose-condensed fluids subject to density-dependent gauge potentials When the energy functional of a Bose-condensed state of matter features an effective gauge potential which depends on the density $\rho$ of the condensate, the kinetic energy density of the matter field becomes nonlinear in $\rho$ and additional flow-dependent terms enter the wave equation for the phase of the condensate wavefunction. To begin with, we consider a certain class of density-dependent `single-component' gauge potentials, and later extend this class to encompass more general `multi-component' potentials. The nonlinear flow terms are cast into the general form of an inner-product between the velocity field of the fluid and the gauge potential. This is achieved by introducing a coupling matrix of dimensionless functions $\gamma_{ij}\left( \rho \right)$, which characterises the particular functional form of the gauge potential and regulates the strengths of the nonlinear terms accordingly. In the momentum-transport equation of the fluid, two non-trivial terms emerge due to the density-dependent vector potential. A body-force of dilation appears as a product of the gauge potential and the dilation rate of the fluid, while the fluid stress tensor features a flow-dependent pressure contribution given by the inner-product of the gauge potential and the current density of the fluid. This explicit dependence of the fluid pressure on the flow highlights the lack of Galilean invariance of the nonlinear fluid.",0

111070,1,"Radiative corrections to quantum sticking on graphene We study the sticking rate of atomic hydrogen to suspended graphene using four different methods that include contributions from processes with multiphonon emission. We compare the numerical results of the sticking rate obtained by: (i) the loop expansion of the atom self-energy; (ii) the noncrossing approximation (NCA); (iii) the independent boson model approximation (IBMA); and (iv) a leading-order soft-phonon resummation method (SPR). The loop expansion reveals an infrared problem, analogous to the infamous infrared problem in QED. The two-loop contribution to the sticking rate gives a result that tends to diverge for large membranes. The latter three methods remedy this infrared problem and give results that are finite in the limit of an infinite membrane. We find that for micromembranes (sizes ranging 100 nm to 10μm), the latter three methods give results that are in good agreement with each other and yield sticking rates that are mildly suppressed relative to the lowest-order golden rule rate. Lastly, we find that the SPR sticking rate decreases slowly to zero with increasing membrane size, while both the NCA and IBMA rates tend to a nonzero constant in this limit. Thus, approximations to the sticking rate can be sensitive to the effects of soft-phonon emission for large membranes.",0
111206,1,"Negative values of quasidistributions and quantum wave and number statistics We consider nonclassical wave and number quantum statistics, and perform a decomposition of quasidistributions for nonlinear optical down-conversion processes using Bessel functions. We show that negative values of the quasidistribution do not directly represent probabilities; however, they directly influence measurable number statistics. Negative terms in the decomposition related to the nonclassical behavior with negative amplitudes of probability can be interpreted as positive amplitudes of probability in the negative orthogonal Bessel basis, whereas positive amplitudes of probability in the positive basis describe classical cases. However, probabilities are positive in all cases, including negative values of quasidistributions. Negative and positive contributions of decompositions to quasidistributions are estimated. The approach can be adapted to quantum coherence functions.",0

Every step of the splitting method is decomposed into sets of quantum gates. It is demonstrated that the algorithm has an exponential speed-up over the implementation of the same numerical scheme on a classical computer, as long as certain conditions are satisfied.

111541,1,"Learning from the machine: interpreting machine learning algorithms for point- and extended- source classification We investigate star-galaxy classification for astronomical surveys in the context of four methods enabling the interpretation of black-box machine learning systems. The first is outputting and exploring the decision boundaries as given by decision tree based methods, which enables the visualization of the classification categories. Secondly, we investigate how the Mutual Information based Transductive Feature Selection (MINT) algorithm can be used to perform feature pre-selection. If one would like to provide only a small number of input features to a machine learning classification algorithm, feature pre-selection provides a method to determine which of the many possible input properties should be selected. Third is the use of the tree-interpreter package to enable popular decision tree based ensemble methods to be opened, visualized, and understood. This is done by additional analysis of the tree based model, determining not only which features are important to the model, but how important a feature is for a particular classification given its value. Lastly, we use decision boundaries from the model to revise an already existing method of classification, essentially asking the tree based method where decision boundaries are best placed and defining a new classification method. We showcase these techniques by applying them to the problem of star-galaxy separation using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (hereafter SDSS). We use the output of MINT and the ensemble methods to demonstrate how more complex decision boundaries improve star-galaxy classification accuracy over the standard SDSS frames approach (reducing misclassifications by up to $\approx33\%$). We then show how tree-interpreter can be used to explore how relevant each photometric feature is when making a classification on an object by object basis.",0

The method is predicated on the freedom of choice of the HMC momentum distribution, and due to its mixing properties, exhibits sample-to-sample autocorrelations that decay far faster than those in the traditional hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We test the methods on distributions of varying correlation structure, finding that the proposed technique produces superior covariance estimates, is less reliant on step-size tuning, and can even function with sparse or no momentum re-sampling.

112239,1,"Weak Calabi-Yau structures and moduli of representations We give a new characterization of weak Calabi-Yau structures in the sense of [KV13] and establish some relations with other concepts. We start by developing some noncommutative calculus for DG categories. In particular we give a new construction of periodic and negative cyclic homology, and we construct a natural extension of the necklace Lie algebra [BL02]. This latter extension still has the structure of a DG Lie algebra, which allows one to define a weak Calabi-Yau structure as a Maurer-Cartan element on a certain filtration piece in its completion. This is equivalent and in a sense Koszul dual to the original definition of [KV13]. We show that a double Poisson structure [VdB08a] is equivalent to a weak Calabi-Yau structure concentrated in certain components. We also adapt the arguments in [Pri17] to show that on a homologically smooth DG category, a (left) $n$-Calabi-Yau structure [Gin,KV13,BD] is equivalent to a non-degenerate weak $n$-Calabi-Yau structure on any cellular model. Finally, using the Van den Bergh functor [VdB08b], we give a constructive proof which shows that for homotopically finitely presented DG categories concentrated in non-negative (homological) degree, any (left) $n$-Calabi-Yau structure induces a $(2-n)$-shifted symplectic structure [PTVV13] on its derived moduli stack of representations; while any weak $n$-Calabi-Yau structure on a semi-free model induces a $(2-n)$-shifted Poisson structure [CPTVV17] on this derived moduli stack.",0
112301,1,"Broad absorption line symbiotic stars: highly ionized species in the fast outflow from MWC 560 In symbiotic binaries, jets and disk winds may be integral to the physics of accretion onto white dwarfs from cool giants. The persistent outflow from symbiotic star MWC 560 (=V694 Mon) is known to manifest as broad absorption lines (BALs), most prominently at the Balmer transitions. We report the detection of high-ionization BALs from C IV, Si IV, N V, and He II in International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra obtained on 1990 April 29-30, when an optical outburst temporarily erased the obscuring 'iron curtain' of absorption troughs from Fe II and similar ions. The C IV and Si IV BALs reached maximum radial velocities at least 1000 km/s higher than contemporaneous Mg II and He II BALs; the same behaviors occur in the winds of quasars and cataclysmic variables. An iron curtain lifts to unveil high-ionization BALs during the P Cygni phase observed in some novae, suggesting by analogy a temporary switch in MWC 560 from persistent outflow to discrete mass ejection. At least three more symbiotic stars exhibit broad absorption with blue edges faster than 1500 km/s; high-ionization BALs have been reported in AS 304 (=V4018 Sgr), while transient Balmer BALs have been reported in Z And and CH Cyg.

112479,1,"Apparent cores and non-circular motions in the HI discs of simulated galaxies We use 'mock' interferometric HI measurements and a conventional tilted-ring modelling procedure to estimate rotation curves of dwarf galaxy discs from the APOSTLE suite of {\Lambda}CDM cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The modelling yields a large diversity of rotation curves for an individual galaxy, depending on the line-of-sight orientation. The diversity is driven by non-circular motions in the gas; in particular, by strong bisymmetric fluctuations in the azimuthal velocities that the tilted-ring model is ill-suited to account for and that are difficult to detect in model residuals. Large under-estimates of the circular velocity can result when the kinematic major axis coincides with the minima of the fluctuation pattern, mimicking the presence of kiloparsec-scale 'cores', when none are actually present. The thickness of APOSTLE discs accentuates the effect, as slowly-rotating extraplanar gas systematically reduces the average line-of-sight speeds in the inner regions. APOSTLE dwarf galaxies compare favourably with observations in terms of the mass, size and kinematics of their HI discs, although the amplitude of their non-circular motions appears somewhat larger than in quiescent discs from the THINGS and LITTLE THINGS surveys. Non-circular motions provide a compelling explanation for the large apparent cores observed in galaxies such as DDO 47 and DDO 87, where such motions are clearly present and might have negatively affected estimates of the inner circular velocities. We argue that non-circular motions might help reconcile the inner rotation cuves of disc galaxies with the 'cusps' expected in cold dark matter-dominated galaxies.",0

112518,1,"Chaos synchronization between the Josephson junctions governed by the central junction under the effect of parameter mismatches and noise Chaos synchronization between Josephson junctions driven by a central junction is studied under the parameter mismatches and noise. It is demonstrated that chaos synchronization quality is robust to 10-15 % parameter mismatches. It is also elucidated that for the intermediary noise intensity correlation between the synchronized junctions can be even enhanced; however for larger intensities of noise synchronization quality deteriorates. It is also established that synchronization quality between some junctions remains unchanged, despite the fact that all the driven junctions and the driver junction were subject to the same amount of noise. These results are of certain importance for obtaining the high power system of Josephson junctions in real-life situations and are promising for practical applications in the Terahertz region.",0

We focus on polynomial models, linear in particular, although the approach can be easily applied to other classes of models. As an example of application, we consider the smoothing of time series in finance. A comparison with moving averages is performed using NIFTY 50 stock market index.

113018,1,"Phase response function for oscillators with strong forcing or coupling Phase response curve (PRC) is an extremely useful tool for studying the response of oscillatory systems, e.g., neurons, to sparse or weak stimulation. Here we develop a framework for studying the response to a series of pulses which are frequent or/and strong. In this case the effect of a stimulus does not vanish before the next one arrives, so the standard PRC fails. In the present letter, we introduce the so-called phase response function (PRF) that measures the phase response even when the system is far from the limit cycle. The PRF uses the history of several previous pulses and does not need the information about the distance from the limit cycle. As a result, an oscillator with pulse input is reduced to a phase system. We illustrate our approach by its application to various systems, such as the Morris-Lecar, Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models, and others. We show that the PRF allows predicting the dynamics of forced and coupled oscillators even when the PRC fails. Thus, the PRF provides an effective tool that may be used for simulation of neural, chemical, optic and other oscillatory systems.",0

In this paper we provide the estimates for costs and physical area required to build such a network. Our estimates indicate that our proposed design offers significant cost advantage over traditional solutions, but higher space utilisation. Next, we show how the latter can be improved with multi-host Ethernet controllers, as an alternative to typical network interface cards.

We estimate the size and shape of the stability domain around the origin, whose main connected component is enclosed by an invariant curve. We describe the evolution of the stability domain as the synchronous phase varies.

In this communication, we prove a normal form theorem for Poisson maps around Poisson transversals. A Poisson map pulls a Poisson transversal back to a Poisson transversal, and our first main result states that simultaneous normal forms exist around such transversals, for which the Poisson map becomes transversally linear, and intertwines the normal form data of the transversals. Our second result concerns symplectic integrations. We prove that a neighborhood of a Poisson transversal is integrable exactly when the Poisson transversal itself is integrable, and in that case we prove a normal form theorem for the symplectic groupoid around its restriction to the Poisson transversal, which puts all structure maps in normal form. We conclude by illustrating our results with examples arising from Lie algebras.",0

113519,1,"Stripping off hydrogens in imidazole triggered by the attachment of a single electron Imidazole [C3H4N2] is ubiquitous in nature as an important biological building block of amino acids, purine nucleobases or antibiotics. In the present study, dissociative electron attachment to imidazole shows low energy shape resonances at 1.52 and 2.29 eV leading to the most abundant dehydrogenated anion [imidazole − H]− through dehydrogenation at the N1 position. All the other anions formed exhibit core excited resonances observed dominantly at similar electron energies of ∼7 and 11 eV, suggesting an initial formation through two temporary negative ion states. Among these anions, multiple dehydrogenation reactions are observed resulting in the loss of 2 up to 4 hydrogens, thus, leading to a complete dehydrogenation of the imidazole molecule, an interesting prototype of complex unimolecular decay induced by the attachment of a single electron. Additionally, the quantum chemical calculations reveal that these multiple dehydrogenation reactions are responsible for the remarkable one electron-induced gas-phase chemistry leading to the opening of the ring. The formation of the observed anions is likely driven by the high positive electron affinity of cyanocarbon molecules supported by quantum chemical calculations. The formation of H− showed additional resonance at about 5 eV and dipolar dissociation above ∼14 eV.",0
113905,1,"On the role of corotation radius in the low T/W dynamical instability of differentially rotating stars We investigate the nature of so-called low T/W dynamical instability in a differentially rotating star, by focusing on the role played by the corotation radius of the unstable oscillation modes. A one-dimensional model of linear perturbation, which neglects dependence of variables on the coordinate along the rotational axis of the star, is solved to obtain stable and unstable eigenmodes. A linear eigenmode having a corotation radius, at which azimuthal pattern speed of the mode coincides with the stellar angular velocity, is categorized to either a complex (growing or damping) mode or a purely real mode belonging to a continuous spectrum of frequency. We compute canonical angular momentum and its flux to study eigenmodes with corotation radius. In a dynamically unstable mode, sound wave transports its angular momentum in such a way that the absolute value of the angular momentum is increased on both sides of the corotation radius. We further evaluate growth of amplitude of reflected sound wave incident to a corotation point, and find that the overreflection of the wave and the trapping of it between the corotation radius and the surface of the star may qualitatively explain dependences of eigenfrequencies on the stellar differential rotation. The results suggest that the low T/W instability may be caused by overreflection of sound waves trapped mainly between the surface of the star and a corotation radius.",0
114085,1,"Parameter estimation with data-driven nonparametric likelihood functions This paper presents a nonparametric modeling technique to avoid expensive evaluation of the likelihood function in estimating parameters of dynamical systems. The proposed method trains the likelihood function using the spectral expansion formulation known as the kernel embedding of conditional distribution. In particular, the spectral expansion uses a set of basis functions of a weighted Hilbert space defined on the data manifold with sampling density as the weight function. This choice of basis functions is justified by a rigorous error estimate. Numerically, these basis functions are estimated using the diffusion maps algorithm with variable bandwidth kernels on the training data set. The estimated likelihood function and posterior densities of the parameters based on this data-driven basis expansion will be compared to those that use analytical basis functions such as the Hermite polynomials and the Fourier cosine functions, which enforce simple geometry assumptions on the data manifold. The numerical results demonstrate the robustness of the data-driven basis functions on parameter estimation of stochastic and deterministic differential equations. In particular, the data-driven basis expansion produces superior estimates compared to those from the Hermite and cosine basis expansions when the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold is strictly less than the dimension of the ambient space.",0

114213,1,"Probabilistic prediction of the AL index with the diffusion forecasting model We propose a nonparametric approach for probabilistic prediction of the AL index trained with AL and solar wind ($v B_z$) data. Our framework relies on the diffusion forecasting technique, which views AL and $ v B_z $ data as observables of an autonomous, ergodic, stochastic dynamical system operating on a manifold. Diffusion forecasting builds a data-driven representation of the Markov semigroup governing the evolution of probability measures of the dynamical system. In particular, the Markov semigroup operator is represented in an orthonormal basis acquired from data using the diffusion maps algorithm and Takens delay embeddings. This representation of the evolution semigroup is used in conjunction with a Bayesian filtering algorithm for forecast initialization to predict the probability that the AL index is less than a user-selected threshold over arbitrary lead times and without requiring exogenous inputs. We find that the model produces skillful forecasts out to at least two-hour leads despite gaps in the training data.",0

I - VIMOS spectroscopy of compact stellar systems in the Fornax core region We present the results of a wide spectroscopic survey aimed at detecting extragalactic globular clusters (GCs) in the core of the Fornax cluster. About 4500 low resolution spectra (from 4800 to 10000 \AA ) were observed in 25 VLT/VIMOS masks covering the central 1 deg$^{2}$ around the dominant galaxy NGC 1399 corresponding to $\sim$175 kpc galactocentric radius. We describe the methodology used for data reduction and data analysis. We found a total of 387 unique physical objects (372 GCs and 15 ultra compact dwarfs) in the field covered by our observations. Most of these objects are associated with NGC 1399, with only 10% likely belonging to other giant galaxies. The new VIMOS dataset is complementary to the many GC catalogues already present in the literature and it brings the total number of tracer particles around NGC 1399 to more than 1130 objects. With this comprehensive radial velocity sample we have found that the velocity dispersion of the GC population (equally for red and blue GC populations) shows a relatively sharp increase from low velocity dispersion ($\sim250$-$350$ kms$^{-1}$) to high velocity dispersion ($\sim300$-$400$ kms$^{-1}$) at projected radius of $\approx10$ arcmin ($\sim60$ kpc) from the galaxy centre. This suggests that at a projected radius of $\approx60$ kpc both blue and red GC populations begin to be governed by the dominating Fornax cluster potential, rather than by the central NGC 1399 galaxy potential. This kinematic evidence corroborates similar results found using surface brightness analysis and planetary nebulae kinematics.",0

We show that for isotropic materials with Young's modulus less than 200 GPa, the Poisson's ratio $\nu$ must lie in a ""magic"" range 0.13<$\nu$<0.23 in order to null the influence of the forces supporting the spacer. This restriction can be overcome with the use of anisotropic materials such as silicon. A detailed study aiming at identification of all suitable crystal orientations of silicon with respect to the resonator body is performed and the relation to the Poisson's ratio and the Young's modulus along these orientations is discussed. We also perform an analysis of the sensitivity of the cavity performance to errors in spacer manufacturing.

114511,1,"Self-Similar One-Dimensional Quasilattices We study 1D quasilattices, especially self-similar ones that can be used to generate two-, three- and higher-dimensional quasicrystalline tesselations that have matching rules and invertible self-similar substitution rules (also known as inflation rules) analogous to the rules for generating Penrose tilings. The lattice positions can be expressed in a closed-form expression we call \emph{floor form}: $x_{n} = S (n-\alpha) + (L-S) \lfloor \kappa (n-\beta) \rfloor$, where $L > S > 0$ and $0 < \kappa < 1$ is an irrational number. We describe three equivalent geometric constructions of these quasilattices and show how they can be subdivided into various types of equivalence classes: (i) \emph{lattice equivalent}, where any two quasilattices in the same lattice equivalence class may be derived from one another by a local decoration/gluing rule; (ii) \emph{self-similar}, a proper subset of lattice equivalent where, in addition, the two quasilattices are locally isomorphic; and (iii) \emph{self-same}, a proper subset of self-similar where, in addition, the two quasilattices are globally isomorphic (i.e. identical up to rescaling). For all three types of equivalence class, we obtain the explicit transformation law between the floor form expression for two quasilattices in the same class. We tabulate (in Table 1 and Figure 5) the ten special self-similar 1D quasilattices relevant for constructing Ammann patterns and Penrose-like tilings in two dimensions and higher, and we explicitly construct and catalog the corresponding self-same quasilattices. Finally, we sketch the extension of our results from degree two to degree $N$ (i.e to 1D quasilattices built from $N$ different intervals).",0
114517,1,"Topological time-series analysis with delay-variant embedding Identifying qualitative changes in time-series data provides insights into the dynamics behind these data. Such changes can be detected through topological approaches, which first embed the time-series data into a high-dimensional space using a time-delay parameter and subsequently extract topological features describing the shape of the data from the embedded points. However, the essential topological features extracted at a single time-delay value are not sufficient for evaluating qualitative changes, even when well-chosen time-delay values are used. We propose a delay-variant embedding scheme that constructs the extended topological features by regarding the time delay as a variable parameter, rather than as a single fixed value. This method allows observation of variations in topological features, where time delay serves as an extra dimension in topological-feature space. We theoretically prove that the proposed topological features are robust under noise perturbation of time series. Furthermore, we combine these features with the kernel technique in machine learning to classify general time-series data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in the classification of synthetic noisy biological data and real electrocardiogram data. Our method outperforms that based on a single time-delay value and, surprisingly, achieves the highest classification accuracy on average among standard time-series analysis techniques.",0

We develop a sufficient decoupling criterion for arbitrary Hamiltonians and a necessary decoupling criterion for semibounded Hamiltonians.

114861,1,"Generalized parafermions and nonlocal Josephson effect in multilayer systems We theoretically investigate the effects of backscattering and superconducting proximity terms between the edges of two multilayer fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems. While the different layers are strongly interacting, we assume that tunneling between them is absent. Studying the boundaries between regions gapped by the two mechanisms in an N-layer system, we find N localized zero-mode operators, realizing a generalized parafermionic algebra. We further propose an experiment capable of probing imprints of the generalized parafermionic bound states. This is done by coupling different superconducting contacts to different layers and examining the periodicity of the Josephson effect as a function of the various relative superconducting phases. Remarkably, even if we apply a phase difference between the superconductors in one layer, we induce a Josephson current at the other layers due to interlayer interactions. Furthermore, while the Josephson effect is commonly used to probe only charged degrees of freedom, the possibility of independently controlling the superconducting phase differences between the layers allows us to find imprints of the neutral modes of the underlying multilayer system. In particular, we propose two configurations, one of which is capable of isolating the signal associated with the charge modes while the other probes the neutral modes.",0
115146,1,"Positron annihilation in the near surface of room temperature ionic liquids Positronium (Ps, a bound state of an electron and a positron) formation in insulating materials is explained by the spur reaction model. According to the model, electron and/or positron mobility affects the yield of Ps formation. A vertical slow positron beam was used to investigate the surface of a room temperature ionic liquid, N,N,N-trimethyl-N-propylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TMPA-TFSI). Measurement of positron lifetimes indicated a higher Ps formation probability in near surface of TMPA-TFSI than in the bulk. This result suggests that the electron (and positron) mobility in the near surface may be larger than that in the bulk. Moreover, the longest annihilation lifetime of triplet Ps (ortho-Ps) in the near surface was found to be shorter than that measured in the bulk liquid. Ortho-Ps lifetimes in liquids are well correlated with the surface tension with a shorter lifetime corresponding to higher surface tension. The higher Ps formation yield and the shorter ortho-Ps annihilation lifetime were probably caused by the layered structure in near surface of TMPA-TFSI. A vertical slow positron beam is a strong tool to investigate the surface of room temperature ionic liquids.",0
115204,1,"Localized Higgs modes of superfluid Bose gases in optical lattices: A Gutzwiller mean-field study We study effects of a potential barrier on collective modes of superfluid Bose gases in optical lattices. We assume that the barrier is created by local suppression of the hopping amplitude. When the system is in a close vicinity of the Mott transition at commensurate fillings, where an approximate particle-hole symmetry emerges, there exist bound states of Higgs amplitude mode that are localized around the barrier. By applying the Gutzwiller mean-field approximation to the Bose-Hubbard model, we analyze properties of normal modes of the system with a special focus on the Higgs bound states. We show that when the system moves away from the Mott transition point, the Higgs bound states turn into quasibound states due to inevitable breaking of the particle-hole symmetry. We use a stabilization method to compute the resonance energy and linewidth of the quasibound states. We compare the results obtained by the Gutzwiller approach with those by the Ginzburg-Landau theory. We find that the Higgs bound states survive even in a parameter region far from the Mott transition, where the Ginzburg-Landau theory fails.",0

We elaborate on a decomposition procedure for the conditional probability function of sequences considered to be high-order Markov chains. We represent the conditional probability function as the sum of multilinear memory function monomials of different orders (from zero up to the chain order). This allows us to introduce a family of Markov chain models and to construct artificial sequences via a method of successive iterations, taking into account at each step increasingly high correlations among random elements. At weak correlations, the memory functions are uniquely expressed in terms of the high-order symbolic correlation functions. The proposed method fills the gap between two approaches, namely the likelihood estimation and the additive Markov chains.

We also find the steady state limits of the quadrature noises and discuss the $ g^{(2)} $ factor of the generated light inside the cavity in the steady state.",0
116015,1,"A necessary condition for strong hyperbolicity of general first order systems We study strong hyperbolicity of first order partial differential equations for systems with differential constraints. In these cases, the number of equations is larger than the unknown fields, therefore, the standard Kreiss necessary and sufficient conditions of strong hyperbolicity do not directly apply. To deal with this problem one introduces a new tensor, called a reduction, which selects a subset of equations with the aim of using them as evolution equations for the unknown. If that tensor leads to a strongly hyperbolic system we call it a hyperbolizer. There might exist many of them or none. A question arises on whether a given system admits any hyperbolization at all. To sort-out this issue, we look for a condition on the system, such that, if it is satisfied, there is no hyperbolic reduction. To that purpose we look at the singular value decomposition of the whole system and study certain one parameter families ($\varepsilon $) of perturbations of the principal symbol. We look for the perturbed singular values around the vanishing ones and show that if they behave as $O\left( \varepsilon ^{l}\right) $, with $l\geq 2$, then there does not exist any hyperbolizer. In addition, we further notice that the validity or failure of this condition can be established in a simple and invariant way. Finally we apply the theory to examples in physics, such as Force-Free Electrodynamics in Euler potentials form and charged fluids with finite conductivity. We find that they do not admit any hyperbolization.",0

116140,1,"Topological waves and odd viscosity in chiral active fluids and plasmas Two-dimensional fluids with broken chiral and time-reversal symmetries can concurrently exhibit two exotic phenomena in their linear response: topologically protected density waves and an anomalous transport coefficient called odd viscosity. We explore the interplay between these phenomena in the acoustic spectrum of a minimal model that describes two types of two-dimensional classical fluids: a magnetized one-component plasma with screened interactions and a chiral active fluid. We show that for large odd viscosity, this transverse response coefficient can be measured via the penetration depth and profile shape of the topologically robust edge waves. We then discuss the relevant regimes for the observation of such edge waves within experimentally realizable plasmas and in synthetic chiral active fluids in which activity and rotation mimic the effects of temperature and magnetic field, respectively.",0
116146,1,"Conditions for the invertibility of dual energy data The Alvarez-Macovski method [Alvarez, R. E and Macovski, A., ""Energy-selective reconstructions in X-ray computerized tomography"", Phys. Med. Biol. (1976), 733--44] requires the inversion of the transformation from the line integrals of the basis set coefficients to measurements with multiple x-ray spectra. Analytical formulas for invertibility of the transformation from two measurements to two line integrals are derived. It is found that non-invertible systems have near zero Jacobian determinants on a nearly straight line in the line integrals plane. Formulas are derived for the points where the line crosses the axes, thus determining the line. Additional formulas are derived for the values of the terms of the Jacobian determinant at the endpoints of the line of non-invertibility. The formulas are applied to a set of spectra including one suggested by Levine that is not invertible as well as similar spectra that are invertible and voltage switched x-ray tube spectra that are also invertible. An iterative inverse transformation algorithm exhibits large errors with non-invertible spectra.",0

In doing that, we demonstrate a particular form of coupling between pseudospin and momentum, resulting in spin-dependent shifts in the spectrum. Our system consists of two coupled, oppositely tilted waveguide arrays, where the evolution of an optical beam allows for probing the dynamics of the evolving wave packets, and the formation of spectral splitting. We show that the Rashba effect can be amplified or decreased through optical nonlinear effects, which correspond to mean-field interactions in various systems such as cold-atom lattices and exciton-polariton condensates.",0
116397,1,"Fluctuations in an established transmission in the presence of a complex environment In various situations where wave transport is preeminent, like in wireless communication, a strong established transmission is present in a complex scattering environment. We develop a nonperturbative approach to describe emerging fluctuations which combines a transmitting channel and a chaotic background in a unified effective Hamiltonian. Modeling such a background by random matrix theory, we derive exact results for both transmission and reflection distributions at arbitrary absorption that is typically present in real systems. Remarkably, in such a complex scattering situation, the transport is governed by only two parameters: an absorption rate and the ratio of the so-called spreading width to the natural width of the transmission line. In particular, we find that the established transmission disappears sharply when this ratio exceeds unity. The approach exemplifies the role of the chaotic background in dephasing the deterministic scattering.",0

116429,1,"A NIKA view of two star-forming infrared dark clouds: Dust emissivity variations and mass concentration The thermal emission of dust grains is a powerful tool for probing cold, dense regions of molecular gas in the ISM, and so constraining dust properties is key to obtaining accurate measurements of dust mass and temperature. By placing constraints on the dust emissivity spectral index, beta, towards two star-forming infrared dark clouds, SDC18.888 and SDC24.489, we evaluate the role of mass concentration in the associated star-formation activity. We exploit the simultaneous 1.2mm and 2.0mm imaging capability of NIKA on the IRAM 30m telescope to construct maps of beta for both clouds, and by incorporating Herschel observations, we create H2 column density maps with 13"" resolution. While we find no significant systematic radial variations around the most massive clumps in either cloud on >0.1 pc scales, their mean beta values are significantly different, with beta = 2.07 +/- 0.09 (rand) +/- 0.25 (syst) for SDC18.888 and beta = 1.71 +/- 0.09 (rand) +/- 0.25 (syst) for SDC24.489. These differences could be a consequence of the very different environments in which both clouds lie, and we suggest that the proximity of SDC18.888 to the W39 HII region may raise beta on scales of 1 pc. We also find that the mass in SDC24.489 is more centrally concentrated and circularly symmetric than in SDC18.888, and is consistent with a scenario in which spherical globally-collapsing clouds concentrate a higher fraction of their mass into a single core than elongated clouds that will more easily fragment, distributing their mass into many cores. We demonstrate that beta variations towards interstellar clouds can be robustly constrained with high-SNR NIKA observations, providing more accurate estimates of their masses. The methods presented here will be applied to the Galactic Star Formation with NIKA2 (GASTON) large programme, extending our analysis to a statistically significant sample of star-forming clouds.",0
116514,1,"Theoretical derivation of laser-dressed atomic states by using a fractal space The derivation of approximate wave functions for an electron submitted to both a Coulomb and a time-dependent laser electric fields, the so-called Coulomb-Volkov (CV) state, is addressed. Despite its derivation for continuum states does not exhibit any particular problem within the framework of the standard theory of quantum mechanics (QM), difficulties arise when considering an initially bound atomic state. Indeed the natural way of translating the unperturbed momentum by the laser vector potential is no longer possible since a bound state does not exhibit a plane wave form explicitly including a momentum. The use of a fractal space permits to naturally define a momentum for a bound wave function. Within this framework, it is shown how the derivation of laser-dressed bound states can be performed. Based on a generalized eikonal approach, a new expression for the laser-dressed states is also derived, fully symmetric relative to the continuum or bound nature of the initial unperturbed wave function. It includes an additional crossed term in the Volkov phase which was not obtained within the standard theory of quantum mechanics. The derivations within this fractal framework have highlighted other possible ways to derive approximate laser-dressed states in QM. After comparing the various obtained wave functions, an application to the prediction of the ionization probability of hydrogen targets by attosecond XUV pulses within the sudden approximation is provided. This approach allows to make predictions in various regimes depending on the laser intensity, going from the non-resonant multiphoton absorption to tunneling and barrier-suppression ionization.",0

116999,1,"Fitting Power-laws in empirical data with estimators that work for all exponents It has been repeatedly stated that maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of exponents of power-law distributions can only be reliably obtained for exponents smaller than minus one. The main argument that power laws are otherwise not normalizable, depends on the underlying sample space the data is drawn from, and is true only for sample spaces that are unbounded from above. Here we show that power-laws obtained from bounded sample spaces (as is the case for practically all data related problems) are always free of such limitations and maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained for arbitrary powers without restrictions. Here we first derive the appropriate ML estimator for arbitrary exponents of power-law distributions on bounded discrete sample spaces. We then show that an almost identical estimator also works perfectly for continuous data. We implemented this ML estimator and discuss its performance with previous attempts. We present a general recipe of how to use these estimators and present the associated computer codes.",0
117150,1,"Conformance checking for programmable logic controller programs and specifications Verification of industrial control systems' software is an important task, as the cost of failure in these systems is typically high. Formal verification methods can complement the currently used testing techniques, especially if requirements are formally specified. Behavioural specifications can be used to perform conformance checking against the implementation. However, the typical conformance relations are often more sensitive to differences than the controlled processes in case of many control systems, resulting in counterexamples during verification that are considered as false positives in practice. To overcome this issue, we introduce conformance relations adapted to control systems based on programmable logic controllers (PLCs) with different levels of permissibility. The relations can be selected by the control engineers, depending on the required compliance levels. Defining the new relations and a model checking-based method to check them makes conformance checking a powerful tool for the verification of industrial control systems.",0

117669,1,"Relative distance between tracers as a measure of diffusivity within moving aggregates Tracking of particles, be it a passive tracer or an actively moving bacterium in the growing bacterial colony, is a powerful technique to probe the physical properties of the environment of the particles. One of the most common measures of particle motion driven by fluctuations and random forces is its diffusivity, which is routinely obtained by measuring the mean squared displacement of the particles. However, often the tracer particles may be moving in a domain or an aggregate which itself experiences some regular or random motion and thus masks the diffusivity of tracers. Here we provide a method for assessing the diffusivity of tracer particles within mobile aggregates by measuring the so-called mean squared relative distance (MSRD) between two tracers. We provide analytical expressions for both the ensemble and time averaged MSRD allowing for direct identification of diffusivities from experimental data.",0

117831,1,"Differential electron emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules under fast ion impact Interaction between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecule and energetic ion is a subject of interest in different areas of modern physics. Here, we present measurements of energy and angular distributions of absolute double differential electron emission cross section for coronene (C24H12) and fluorene (C13H10) molecules under fast bare oxygen ion impact. For coronene, the angular distributions of the low energy electrons are quite different from that of simpler targets like Ne or CH4, which is not the case for fluorene. The behaviour of the higher electron energy distributions for both the targets are similar to that for simple targets. In case of coronene, a clear signature of plasmon resonance is observed in the analysis of forward-backward angular asymmetry of low energy electron emission. For fluorene, such signature is not identified probably due to lower oscillator strength of plasmon compared to the coronene. The theoretical calculation based on the first-order Born approximation with correct boundary conditions (CB1), in general, reproduced the experimental observations qualitatively, for both the molecules, except in the low energy region for coronene, which again indicates the role of collective excitation. Single differential and total cross sections are also deduced. An overall comparative study is presented.",0

Here the synthetic dimension is provided by hyperfine spin states, and the synthetic field is created by laser-induced transitions between them. While the interaction is short-range in real space, it is long-range in the synthetic dimension in sharp contrast with fractional quantum Hall systems. Introducing an analog of the lowest-Landau-level approximation valid for large transition amplitudes, we derive an effective one-dimensional lattice model, in which density-density interactions turn out to play a dominant role.

117987,1,"Stochastic Longshore Current Dynamics We develop a stochastic parametrization, based on a `simple' deterministic model for the dynamics of steady longshore currents, that produces ensembles that are statistically consistent with field observations of these currents. Unlike deterministic models, stochastic parameterization incorporates randomness and hence can only match the observations in a statistical sense. Unlike statistical emulators, in which the model is tuned to the statistical structure of the observation, stochastic parametrization are not directly tuned to match the statistics of the observations. Rather, stochastic parameterization combines deterministic, i.e physics based models with stochastic models for the ""missing physics"" to create hybrid models, that are stochastic, but yet can be used for making predictions, especially in the context of data assimilation. We introduce a novel measure of the utility of stochastic models of complex processes, that we call {\em consistency of sensitivity}.

118011,1,"Symmetry protected bosonic topological phase transitions: Quantum Anomalous Hall system of weakly interacting spinor bosons in a square lattice We study possible many body phenomena in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system of weakly interacting spinor bosons in a square lattice. There are various novel spin-bond correlated superfluids (SF) and quantum or topological phase transitions among these SF phases. One transition is a first order one driven by roton droppings ( but with non-zero gaps $ \Delta_R $ ) tuned by the Zeeman field $ h $. Another is a second order bosonic Lifshitz transition with the dynamic exponents $ z_x=z_y=2 $ and an accompanying $ [C_4 \times C_4]_D $ symmetry breaking. It is driven by the softening of the superfluid Goldstone mode tuned by the ratio of spin-orbit coupled (SOC) strength over the hopping strength. The two phase boundaries meet at a topological tri-critical (TT) point which separates the $ h=0 $ line into two SF phases with $ N=2 $ and $ N=4 $ condensation momenta respectively. At the $ h=0 $ line where the system has an anti-unitary $ Z_2 $ Reflection symmetry, there are infinite number of classically degenerate family of states on both sides. We perform a systematic order from quantum disorder analysis to find the quantum ground states, also calculate the roton gaps $ \Delta_R $ generated by the order from disorder mechanism on both sides of the TT point. The $ N=2 $ and $ N=4 $ SF phases have the same spin-orbital XY-AFM spin structure, respect the anti-unitary symmetry and break the $ [C_4 \times C_4]_D $ symmetry, so they be distinguished only by the different topology of the BEC condensation momenta instead of by any differences in the symmetry breaking patterns.

118079,1,"Analysis of nonlinear dynamics by square matrix method The nonlinear dynamics of a system with periodic structure can be analyzed using a square matrix. We show that because of the special property of the square matrix constructed for nonlinear dynamics, we can reduce the dimension of the matrix from the original large number for high order calculations to a low dimension in the first step of the analysis. Then a stable Jordan decomposition is obtained with much lower dimension. The Jordan decomposition leads to a transformation to a new variable, which is an accurate action-angle variable, in good agreement with trajectories and tune obtained from tracking. More importantly, the deviation from constancy of the new action-angle variable provides a measure of the stability of the phase space trajectories and tune fluctuation. Thus the square matrix theory shows a good potential in theoretical understanding of a complicated dynamical system to guide the optimization of dynamical apertures. The method is illustrated by many examples of comparison between theory and numerical simulation. In particular, we show that the square matrix method can be used for fast optimization to reduce the nonlinearity of a system.",0

Typically, a random phenomenon is described using the measure-theoretic formulation of probability theory. Such a description can also be done using algebraic methods, which are capable to deal with non-commutative random variables (like in quantum mechanics).

This will be done using the entropic uncertainty relations between random variables, in order to evaluate the presence of non-commutativity in their algebraic description.",0
118243,1,"Large turbulent reservoirs of cold molecular gas around high-redshift starburst galaxies Starburst galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation are among the most extreme starforming engines in the universe, producing stars over ~100 Myr. The star formation rates of these galaxies, which exceed 100 $M_\odot$ per year, require large reservoirs of cold molecular gas to be delivered to their cores, despite strong feedback from stars or active galactic nuclei. Starburst galaxies are therefore ideal targets to unravel the critical interplay between this feedback and the growth of a galaxy. The methylidyne cation, CH$^+$, is a most useful molecule for such studies because it cannot form in cold gas without supra-thermal energy input, so its presence highlights dissipation of mechanical energy or strong UV irradiation. Here, we report the detection of CH$^+$(J=1-0) emission and absorption lines in the spectra of six lensed starburst galaxies at redshifts z~2.5. This line has such a high critical density for excitation that it is emitted only in very dense ($>10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, and is absorbed in low-density gas. We find that the CH$^+$ emission lines, which are broader than 1000 km s$^{-1}$, originate in dense shock waves powered by hot galactic winds. The CH$^+$ absorption lines reveal highly turbulent reservoirs of cool ($T\sim 100$K), low-density gas, extending far outside (>10 kpc) the starburst cores (radii <1 kpc). We show that the galactic winds sustain turbulence in the 10 kpc-scale environments of the starburst cores, processing these environments into multi-phase, gravitationally bound reservoirs. However, the mass outflow rates are found to be insufficient to balance the star formation rates. Another mass input is therefore required for these reservoirs, which could be provided by on-going mergers or cold stream accretion. Our results suggest that galactic feedback, coupled jointly to turbulence and gravity, extends the starburst phase instead of quenching it.",0

The null foliation on the boundary in this case is the Hopf fibration on the 3-sphere and the totally null planes in the boundary are integrable. The metric on the 4-ball is a conformally flat, scalar-flat, positive Ricci curvature neutral metric. The second constructions are subsets of the 4-dimensional space of oriented geodesics in a 3-dimensional space-form, equipped with its canonical neutral metric. We consider all oriented geodesics tangent to a given embedded strictly convex 2-sphere. The third is a neutral geometric model for the intersection of two surfaces in a 4-manifold. The surfaces are the sets of oriented normal lines to two round spheres in Euclidean 3-space, which form Lagrangian surfaces in the 4-dimensional space of all oriented lines. The intersection of the boundaries of their normal neighbourhoods form tori that we prove are totally real and Lorentz if the spheres do not intersect. We conclude with possible topological applications of the three constructions, including neutral Kirby calculus, neutral knot invariants and neutral Casson handles, respectively.",0

Quantum systems are subsystems of classical statistical systems. We discuss static memory materials based on Ising spins that realize quantum operations as the Hadamard or CNOT-gate for the quantum subsystem. Classical spins can account for the entanglement of quantum spins. An arbitrary unitary evolution for an arbitrary number of quantum spins can be described by static memory materials for an infinite number of Ising spins. We discuss discrete subsets of unitary operations realized by a finite number of Ising spins. They may be useful for new computational structures. We suggest that features of quantum computation or more general probabilistic computation may be realized by neural networks, neuromorphic computing or the brain. We propose a general formalism for probabilistic computing for which deterministic computing and quantum computing are special limiting cases.",0

119252,1,"Mechanism of slow equilibration of isolated quantum systems We discuss the approach toward equilibrium of an isolated quantum system. For a wide class of systems we argue that the time-averaged expectation value of a local operator in any initial state is bounded by the so-called deviation function, which characterizes maximal deviation from the equilibrium for all states with a given value of energy fluctuations. We provide numerical evidence that the bound is approximately saturated by the initial configurations with spatial inhomogeneities at macroscopic level. In this way the deviation function establishes an explicit connection between the macroscopically observed timescales associated with transport and properties of microscopic matrix elements. The form of the deviation function indicates that among the slowest states which saturate the bound there are also those with arbitrarily long equilibration times.",0

119352,1,"Dynamics of first-order quantum phase transitions in extended Bose-Hubbard model: From density wave to superfluid and vice-versa In this paper, we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model with the nearest-neighbor repulsion by using time-dependent Gutzwiller (GW) methods. In particular, we vary the hopping parameters in the Hamiltonian as a function of time, and investigate the dynamics of the system from the density wave (DW) to the superfluid (SF) crossing a first-order phase transition and vice-versa. From the DW to SF, we find scaling laws for the correlation length and vortex density with respect to the quench time. This is a reminiscence of the Kibble-Zurek scaling for continuous phase transitions and contradicts the common expectation. On the other hand from the SF to DW, the system evolution depends on the initial SF state. When the initial state is the ground-state obtained by the static GW methods, a coexisting state of the SF and DW domains forms after passing through the critical point. Coherence of the SF order parameter is lost as the system evolves. This is a phenomenon similar to the glass transition in classical systems. Starting from the SF with small local phase fluctuations, the system is getting a large-size DW-domain structure with thin domain walls.",0

Finally, we illustrate the scaling laws of the attainable precisions with the number of photons in the probe state.",0

In this article, we describe reference values for a distance between samples derived from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic $D_{F,F'}$. Each measure of the $D_{F,F'}$ is a measure of difference between two samples. This distance is normalized by the number of observations in each sample to yield the $c'=D_{F,F'}\sqrt{\frac{n n'}{n+n'}}$ statistic, for which high levels favor the rejection of the null hypothesis (that the samples are drawn from the same distribution). One great feature of $c'$ is that it inherits the robustness of $D_{F,F'}$ and is thus suitable for use in settings where the underlying distributions are not known. Benchmarks are obtained by comparing samples derived from standard distributions. The supplied example applications of the $c'$ statistic for the distinction of samples in real data enables further insights about the robustness and power of such statistical distance.",0

119865,1,"Magnons in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$: possible evidence for Goldstone-Higgs interaction in a weakly ordered spin-1/2 chain antiferromagnet The Goldstone theorem mandates that a spontaneous symmetry breaking entails the emergence of gap(mass)less excitations. In the case where a rotational invariance of a system of spin magnetic moments is broken by an antiferromagnetic order, these are well-known transverse spin waves. The interaction of such Goldstone magnons with the Higgs amplitude mode of the order parameter is usually discarded, even though glimpses of Higgs physics have recently been reported in a quantum magnet, a topological insulator, and ferroelectric and disordered superconductor systems. The Goldstone-Higgs interactions could be expected to grow in importance near a quantum critical point (QCP), where the symmetry-breaking order is weak, and its amplitude fluctuations are significant. Here we report an electron spin resonance (ESR) study of a nearly one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain system, Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, which presents exactly such a case. The ESR spectra at $T > T_N$, in the disordered Luttinger-spin-liquid phase with unconfined spinons reveal ideal Heisenberg-chain behavior with only very small, field-independent linewidth, $\sim 1/T$. In the ordered state, below $T_N$, we identify antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) modes, which are well described by pseudo-Goldstone magnons in the model of a collinear biaxial antiferromagnet with two gaps, $\Delta_1 = 23.0$ GHz and $\Delta_2 = 13.3$ GHz. Additionally, we observe a major resonant response of special nature, which we attribute to magnon interaction with the Higgs amplitude mode in a weakly ordered antiferromagnet. Its unusual field dependence indicates the presence of a quantum phase transition at $\mu_0 H \simeq 9.4$ T.",0
119966,1,"Two-dimensional electron systems in $A{\mathrm{TiO}}_{3}$ perovskites ($A=\mathrm{Ca}$, Ba, Sr): Control of orbital hybridization and energy order We report the existence of a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at the ( 001 ) surface of CaTiO 3 . Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find a hybridization between the d x z and d y z orbitals, not observed in the 2DESs at the surfaces of other A TiO 3 perovskites, e.g., SrTiO 3 or BaTiO 3 . Based on a comparison of the 2DES properties in these three materials, we show how the electronic structure of the 2DES (bandwidth, orbital energy order, and electron density) is coupled to different typical lattice distortions in perovskites. The orbital hybridization in orthorhombic CaTiO 3 results from the rotation of the oxygen octahedra, which can also occur at the interface of oxide heterostructures to compensate strain. More generally, the control of the orbital energy order in 2DES by choosing different A -site cations in perovskites offers a gateway toward 2DESs in oxide heterostructures beyond SrTiO 3 .",0
120021,1,"Bayesian optimization for computationally extensive probability distributions An efficient method for finding a better maximizer of computationally extensive probability distributions is proposed on the basis of a Bayesian optimization technique. A key idea of the proposed method is to use extreme values of acquisition functions by Gaussian processes for the next training phase, which should be located near a local maximum or a global maximum of the probability distribution. Our Bayesian optimization technique is applied to the posterior distribution in the effective physical model estimation, which is a computationally extensive probability distribution. Even when the number of sampling points on the posterior distributions is fixed to be small, the Bayesian optimization provides a better maximizer of the posterior distributions in comparison to those by the random search method, the steepest descent method, or the Monte Carlo method. Furthermore, the Bayesian optimization improves the results efficiently by combining the steepest descent method and thus it is a powerful tool to search for a better maximizer of computationally extensive probability distributions.",0
120040,1,"Functional crossover in the dispersion relations of magnons and phonons Experimental data are presented showing that the dispersion relations of magnons and acoustic phonons can consist of two sections with different functions of wave vector. In the low wave vector range a power function of wave vector often holds over a finite q-range while dispersions for larger wave vector values better approach the atomistic model predictions. In the magnon spectra ∼⃒q(x) power functions with exponents x=1.25, 1.5 and 2 are identified. The dispersion of the acoustic phonons can be a linear function of wave vector over a surprisingly large range of energy. Since the slope of the linear section agrees with the known sound velocities it can be concluded that the dispersion of the acoustic phonons has got attracted by the linear dispersion of the mass less Debye bosons (sound waves). Due to the different (translational) symmetries of bosons and atomistic excitations (magnons, phonons) the associated dispersions can attract each other. In the same way the different ∼⃒q(x) power functions in the magnon dispersions indicate that magnon dispersions are attracted by the dispersion of the bosons of the magnetic continuum (Goldstone bosons). This allows evaluation of the otherwise difficult to obtain dispersions of the Goldstone bosons from the known magnon dispersions. Interestingly, the dispersions of Goldstone bosons (Debye bosons) attract magnon dispersions (phonon dispersions) and not vice versa.",0

Finally we provided a necessary and sufficient condition for a $J$-frame potential of the corresponding $\zeta-J$-tight frame to be minimum.",0
120113,1,"Accretion of clumpy cold gas onto massive black holes binaries: the challenging formation of extended circumbinary structures Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) represent an unavoidable outcome of hierarchical galaxy formation, but their dynamical evolution at sub-parsec scales is poorly understood, due to a combination of uncertainties in theoretical models and lack of firm observational evidence. In gas rich environments, it has been shown that a putative extended, steady circumbinary gaseous disc plays an important role in the MBHB evolution, facilitating its coalescence. How gas on galactic scales is transported to the nuclear region to form and maintain such a stable structure is, however, unclear. If, following a galaxy merger, turbulent gas is condenses in cold clumps and filaments that are randomly scattered, gas is naturally transported on parsec scales and interacts with the MBHB in discrete incoherent pockets. The aim of this work is to investigate the gaseous structures arising from this interaction. We employ a suite of smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic simulations to study the formation and evolution of gaseous structures around a MBHB constantly perturbed by the incoherent infall of molecular clouds. We investigate the influence of the infall rate and angular momentum distribution of the clouds on the geometry and stability of the arising structures. We find that the continuous supply of incoherent clouds is a double-edge sword, resulting in the intermittent formation and disruption of circumbinary structures. Anisotropic cloud distributions featuring an excess of co-rotating events generate more prominent co-rotating circumbinary discs. Similar structures are seen when mostly counter-rotating clouds are fed to the binary, even though they are more compact and less stable. In general, our simulations do not show the formation of extended smooth and stable circumbinary discs, typically assumed in analytical and numerical investigations of the the long term evolution of MBHBs.

120296,1,"A General Probabilistic Approach for Quantitative Assessment of LES Combustion Models The Wasserstein metric is introduced as a probabilistic method to enable quantitative evaluations of LES combustion models. The Wasserstein metric can directly be evaluated from scatter data or statistical results using probabilistic reconstruction against experimental data. The method is derived and generalized for turbulent reacting flows, and applied to validation tests involving the Sydney piloted jet flame. It is shown that the Wasserstein metric is an effective validation tool that extends to multiple scalar quantities, providing an objective and quantitative evaluation of model deficiencies and boundary conditions on the simulation accuracy. Several test cases are considered, beginning with a comparison of mixture-fraction results, and the subsequent extension to reactive scalars, including temperature and species mass fractions of \ce{CO} and \ce{CO2}. To demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method in application to multiple datasets, the Wasserstein metric is applied to a series of different simulations that were contributed to the TNF-workshop. Analysis of the results allowed to identify competing contributions to model deviations, arising from uncertainties in the boundary conditions and model deficiencies. These applications demonstrate that the Wasserstein metric constitutes an easily applicable mathematical tool that reduce multiscalar combustion data and large datasets into a scalar-valued quantitative measure.",0

We reveal very broad [CII] wings tracing the presence of outflows with velocities in excess of 1000 km/s. We find that the luminosity of the broad [CII] emission increases with LAGN, while it does not significantly depend on the SFR of the host galaxy, indicating that the central AGN is the main driving mechanism of the [CII] outflows in these powerful, distant QSOs. From the stack of the ALMA cubes, we derive an average outflow spatial extent of ~2 kpc. The average mass outflow rate inferred from the whole sample stack is ~ 170 Msun/yr, while for the most luminous systems it increases to ~340 Msun/yr. The associated outflow kinetic power is about 0.1\% of LAGN, while the outflow momentum rate is about LAGN/c or lower, suggesting that these outflows are either driven by radiation pressure onto dusty clouds or, alternatively, are driven by the nuclear wind and energy conserving but with low coupling with the ISM.

By calculating various concepts in record dynamics, we find some interesting results. In stationary fractional Gaussian noises, we observe a universal behavior for the whole range of Hurst exponents. However, for non-stationary fractional Brownian motions, the record dynamics is crucially dependent on the memory, which plays the role of a non-stationarity index, here. Indeed, the deviation from the results of the stationary case increases by increasing the Hurst exponent in fractional Brownian motions. We demonstrate that the memory governs the dynamics of the records as long as it causes non-stationarity in fractal stochastic processes; otherwise, it has no impact on the record statistics.",0
120800,1,"Using Quantum Mechanics to Cluster Time Series In this article we present a method by which we can reduce a time series into a single point in $\mathbb{R}^{13}$. We have chosen 13 dimensions so as to prevent too many points from being labeled as ""noise."" When using a Euclidean (or Mahalanobis) metric, a simple clustering algorithm will with near certainty label the majority of points as ""noise."" On pure physical considerations, this is not possible. Included in our 13 dimensions are four parameters which describe the coefficients of a cubic polynomial attached to a Gaussian picking up a general trend, four parameters picking up periodicity in a time series, two each for amplitude of a wave and period of a wave, and the final five report the ""leftover"" noise of the detrended and aperiodic time series. Of the final five parameters, four are the centralized probabilistic moments, and the final for the relative size of the series. The first main contribution of this work is to apply a theorem of quantum mechanics about the completeness of the solutions to the quantum harmonic oscillator on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ to estimating trends in time series. The second main contribution is the method of fitting parameters. After many numerical trials, we realized that methods such a Newton-Rhaphson and Levenberg-Marquardt converge extremely fast if the initial guess is good. Thus we guessed many initial points in our parameter space and computed only a few iterations, a technique common in Keogh's work on time series clustering. Finally, we have produced a model which gives incredibly accurate results quickly. We ackowledge that there are faster methods as well of more accurate methods, but this work shows that we can still increase computation speed with little, if any, cost to accuracy in the sense of data clustering.",0

120991,1,"Phase space reconstruction for non-uniformly sampled noisy time series Analyzing data from paleoclimate archives such as tree rings or lake sediments offers the opportunity of inferring information on past climate variability. Often, such data sets are univariate and a proper reconstruction of the system's higher-dimensional phase space can be crucial for further analyses. In this study, we systematically compare the methods of time delay embedding and differential embedding for phase space reconstruction. Differential embedding relates the system's higher-dimensional coordinates to the derivatives of the measured time series. For implementation, this requires robust and efficient algorithms to estimate derivatives from noisy and possibly non-uniformly sampled data. For this purpose, we consider several approaches: (i) central differences adapted to irregular sampling, (ii) a generalized version of discrete Legendre coordinates and (iii) the concept of Moving Taylor Bayesian Regression. We evaluate the performance of differential and time delay embedding by studying two paradigmatic model systems - the Lorenz and the R\""ossler system. More precisely, we compare geometric properties of the reconstructed attractors to those of the original attractors by applying recurrence network analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the potential and the limitations of using the different phase space reconstruction methods in combination with windowed recurrence network analysis for inferring information about past climate variability. This is done by analyzing two well-studied paleoclimate data sets from Ecuador and Mexico. We find that studying the robustness of the results when varying the analysis parameters is an unavoidable step in order to make well-grounded statements on climate variability and to judge whether a data set is suitable for this kind of analysis.",0

121397,1,"Interferometric analogue of chronology protection Consider a unitary beam splitter $\rightrightarrows U \rightrightarrows $, i.e. a unitary map where we have divided the input and output into pairs of `ports'. Dimensions of the ports are arbitrary, finite or infinite. Now connect one output port with an input port by a feedback loop, so that only single external ports remain, $\rightarrow \underset{\circlearrowright}{U}\rightarrow$. The question is: Can we find such a $U$ that a part of an input signal will get trapped in the loop? If so, we could produce an interferometric analogue of a black hole. We prove that this is impossible. No matter which $U$ one selects the process $\psi_{\rm in}\rightarrow \underset{\circlearrowright}{U}\rightarrow \psi_{\rm out}$ implies $||\psi_{\rm in}||=||\psi_{\rm out}||$, i.e. a looped beam splitter is always fully reflecting. Since properties of both $U$ and the looped dynamics get encoded in the scattering phase shift, one can probe the otherwise unaccessible loop region by a Mach-Zehnder interferometry. The Elitzur-Vaidman `bomb' test with the bomb placed in the loop can be interpreted as an interferometric analogue of the `grandfather problem' in the presence of a closed time-like curve. However, here the `grandfather paradox' is absent in consequence of the looped interference. The formalism we employ is based on the standard superposition principle. As opposed to the Deutsch formalism, the loop does not lead to a nonlinear evolution. This is not surprising: An analogous topology occurs in Michelson interferometers but their description does not require nonlinear electrodynamics.",0

Classical beam wander correction techniques cannot be applied due to the stronger requirements of transmitting single photons. One strategy to overcome this limitation consists in using a separate wavelength from that of the quantum signal to analyze the beam wander and use this information for its correction. For this strategy to work adequately, both wavelengths should be affected equally by atmospheric turbulence, i.e. no chromatic effects should be originated from beam wander.

We establish connections between the $1/p$-concavity and the real-rootedness of some polynomials built on the coefficients. We conjecture that if the restriction of the linear combination to the positive diagonal is a real-rooted polynomial, then the linear combination is $1/p$-concave. Using the theory of hyperbolic polynomials, we show that this would be implied by a short algebraic statement: if the polynomials $P$ and $Q$ of degree $n$ are real-rooted, then $\sum_{k=0}^n P^{(k)}Q^{(n-k)}$ is real-rooted as well.

122089,1,"Risks for life on habitable planets from superflares of their host stars We explore some of the ramifications arising from superflares on the evolutionary history of Earth, other planets in the solar system, and exoplanets. We propose that the most powerful superflares can serve as plausible drivers of extinction events, and that their periodicity corresponds to certain patterns in the terrestrial fossil diversity record. On the other hand, weaker superflares may play a positive role in enabling the origin of life through the formation of key organic compounds. Superflares could also prove to be quite detrimental to the evolution of complex life on present-day Mars and exoplanets in the habitable zone of M- and K-dwarfs. We conclude that the risk posed by superflares has not been sufficiently appreciated, and that humanity might potentially witness a superflare event in the next $\sim {10}^{3}$ years, leading to devastating economic and technological losses. In light of the many uncertainties and assumptions associated with our analysis, we recommend that these results should be viewed with due caution.",0

122411,1,"Quantitative modeling of complex molecular response in coherent cavity-enhanced dual-comb spectroscopy We present a complex-valued electric field model for experimentally observed cavity transmission in coherent cavity-enhanced (CE) multiplexed spectroscopy (i.e., dual-comb spectroscopy, DCS). The transmission model for CE-DCS differs from that previously derived for Fourier-transform CE direct frequency comb spectroscopy [Foltynowicz et al., Appl. Phys. B 110, 163-175 (2013)] by the treatment of the local oscillator which, in the case of CE-DCS, does not interact with the enhancement cavity. Validation is performed by measurements of complex-valued near-infrared spectra of CO and CO$_2$ by an electro-optic frequency comb coherently coupled to an enhancement cavity of finesse $F=19600$. Following validation, we measure the $30012\leftarrow00001$ $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$ vibrational band origin with a combined standard uncertainty of 770 kHz (fractional uncertainty of $4\times10^{-9}$).",0
122714,1,Zero Range Process and Multi-Dimensional Random Walks The special limit of the totally asymmetric zero range process of the low-dimensional non-equilibrium statistical mechanics described by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is considered. The calculation of the conditional probabilities of the model are based on the algebraic Bethe ansatz approach. We demonstrate that the conditional probabilities may be considered as the generating functions of the random multi-dimensional lattice walks bounded by a hyperplane. This type of walks we call the walks over the multi-dimensional simplicial lattices. The answers for the conditional probability and for the number of random walks in the multi-dimensional simplicial lattice are expressed through the symmetric functions.,0

The system is composed of two interacting non-equivalent planes in which the intralayer couplings are ferromagnetic while the interlayer interactions are antiferromagnetic. Moreover, one of the planes is randomly diluted. The study is carried out within a Monte Carlo approach employing the multiple histogram reweighting method and finite-size scaling tools. The occurrence of a compensation phenomenon is verified and the compensation temperature, as well as the critical temperature for the model, are obtained as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We present a detailed discussion of the regions of the parameter space where the compensation effect is present or absent. Our results are then compared to a mean-field-like approximation applied to the same model by Balcerzak and Szałowski (2014). Although the Monte Carlo and mean-field results agree qualitatively, our quantitative results are significantly different.",0

123103,1,"Primary thermometry triad at 6 mK in mesoscopic circuits Quantum physics emerge and develop as temperature is reduced. Although mesoscopic electrical circuits constitute an outstanding platform to explore quantum behavior, the challenge in cooling the electrons impedes their potential. The strong coupling of such micrometer-scale devices with the measurement lines, combined with the weak coupling to the substrate, makes them extremely difficult to thermalize below 10 mK and imposes in-situ thermometers. Here we demonstrate electronic quantum transport at 6 mK in micrometer-scale mesoscopic circuits. The thermometry methods are established by the comparison of three in-situ primary thermometers, each involving a different underlying physics. The employed combination of quantum shot noise, quantum back-action of a resistive circuit and conductance oscillations of a single-electron transistor covers a remarkably broad spectrum of mesoscopic phenomena. The experiment, performed in vacuum using a standard cryogen-free dilution refrigerator, paves the way toward the sub-millikelvin range with additional thermalization and refrigeration techniques.",0

123332,1,"Insights from ab-initio non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics: Bridging quantum chemistry and quantum optics By applying the Born-Huang expansion, originally developed for coupled nucleus-electron systems, to the full nucleus-electron-photon Hamiltonian of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the long-wavelength approximation, we deduce an exact set of coupled equations for electrons on photonic energy surfaces and the nuclei on the resulting polaritonic energy surfaces. Since the photonic surfaces and the corresponding non-adiabatic coupling elements can be solved analytically, the resulting expansion can be brought into a compact form which allows us to analyze certain aspects of coupled nucleus-electron-photon systems in a simple and intuitive manner. Furthermore, we discuss structural differences between the exact quantum treatment and Floquet theory, that along this line existing implementations can be adjusted to incorporate QED and how standard drawbacks of Floquet theory can be overcome. We then highlight, by assuming that the relevant photonic frequencies of a prototypical cavity QED experiment are in the energy range of the electrons, how from this generalized Born-Huang expansion an adopted Born-Oppenheimer approximation for nuclei on polaritonic surfaces can be deduced. By restricting the basis set of this generalized Born-Oppenheimer approximation we span the ark from quantum chemistry to quantum optics by recovering simple models of coupled matter-photon systems employed in quantum optics and polaritonic chemistry. We finally highlight numerically that simple few level models can lead to physically wrong predictions, even in the weak coupling regime, and show how the presented derivations from first principles help to check and derive physically grounded simplified models.",0
123359,1,"Centrifugal acceleration in the isotropic photon field In this paper, we study centrifugal acceleration of particles moving along a prescribed rotating curved trajectories. We consider the physical system embedded in an isotropic photon field and study the influence of the photon drag force on the acceleration process. For this purpose, we study three major configurations of the field lines: the straight line, the Archimede spiral and the dipolar field line configuration. By analyzing dynamics of particles sliding along the field lines in the equatorial plane, we have found several interesting features of motion. In particular, it has been shown that for rectilinear field lines, the particles reach the light cylinder (area where the linear velocity of rotation exactly equals the speed of light) zone relatively slowly for bigger drag forces. Considering the Archimedes’ spiral, we have found that in cases when the field lines lag behind the rotation, the particles achieve the force-free regime of dynamics regardless of the drag force. Unlike this scenario, when the spiral is oriented in an opposite direction, the particles do not reach the force free regime, but tend to stable equilibrium locations.",0

123516,1,"Stable dynamics of micro-machined inductive contactless suspensions In this article, we present a qualitative approach to study the dynamics and stability of micro-machined inductive contactless suspensions (MIS). In the framework of this approach, the induced eddy current into a levitated micro-object is considered as a collection of m-eddy current circuits. Assuming small displacements and the quasi- static behaviour of the levitated micro-object, a generalized model of MIS is obtained and represented as a set of six linear differential equations corresponding to six degrees of freedom in a rigid body by using Lagrange-Maxwell formalism. The linear model allows us to investigate the general stability properties of the MIS as a dynamic system, and these properties are synthesized in three major theorems. In particular, we prove that the stable levitation in the MIS without damping is impossible. Based on the approach presented herewith, we give general guidelines for MIS designing. In addition to we demonstrate the successful application of this technique to study the dynamics and stability of the symmetric and axially symmetric MIS designs both based on 3D micro-coil technology.",0
123532,1,"Anomalous breaking of scale invariance in a two-dimensional Fermi gas The frequency of the breathing mode of a classical two dimensional Fermi gas in a harmonic confinement is fixed by the scale invariance of the Hamiltonian. Scale invariance is broken on the quantum mechanical level by introducing the two dimensional scattering length as a regulator. This is an example of a quantum anomaly in the field of ultracold atoms and leads to a shift of the frequency of the collective breathing mode of the cloud. In this work, we study this anomalous frequency shift for a two component Fermi gas in the strongly interacting regime. We measure significant shifts away from the scale invariant result that depend strongly on both interactions and temperature. We find qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations at zero temperature.",0
123538,1,"The clock of chemical evolution Chemical evolution is essential in understanding the origins of life. We present a theory for the evolution of molecule masses and show that small molecules grow by random diffusion and large molecules by a preferential attachment process leading eventually to life's molecules. It reproduces correctly the distribution of molecules found via mass spectroscopy for the Murchison meteorite and estimates the start of chemical evolution back to 12.8 billion years following the birth of stars and supernovae. From the Frontier mass between the random and preferential attachment dynamics the birth time of molecule families can be estimated. Amino acids emerge about 165 million years after the start of evolution. Using the scaling of reaction rates with the distance of the molecules in space we recover correctly the few days emergence time of amino acids in the Miller-Urey experiment. The distribution of interstellar and extragalactic molecules are both consistent with the evolutionary mass distribution, and their age is estimated to 108 and 65 million years after the start of evolution. From the model, we can determine the number of different molecule compositions at the time of the creation of Earth to be 1.6 million and the number of molecule compositions in interstellar space to a mere 719.",0
123542,1,"New theory of stellar convection without the mixing-length parameter: new stellar atmosphere model Stellar convection is usually described by the mixing-length theory, which makes use of the mixing-length scale factor to express the convective flux, velocity, and temperature gradients of the convective elements and stellar medium. The mixing-length scale is proportional to the local pressure scale height of the star, and the proportionality factor (i.e. mixing-length parameter) is determined by comparing the stellar models to some calibrator, i.e. the Sun. No strong arguments exist to suggest that the mixing-length parameter is the same in all stars and all evolutionary phases and because of this, all stellar models in the literature are hampered by this basic uncertainty. In a recent paper [1] we presented a new theory that does not require the mixing length parameter. Our self-consistent analytical formulation of stellar convection determines all the properties of stellar convection as a function of the physical behavior of the convective elements themselves and the surrounding medium. The new theory of stellar convection is formulated starting from a conventional solution of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations expressed in a non-inertial reference frame co-moving with the convective elements. The motion of stellar convective cells inside convective-unstable layers is fully determined by a new system of equations for convection in a non-local and time-dependent formalism. The predictions of the new theory are compared with those from the standard mixing-length paradigm with positive results for atmosphere models of the Sun and all the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.",0

We derive lower bounds on the precision of phase estimation and a closely related problem of frequency estimation. For both problems we show that it is impossible to achieve the Heisenberg limit asymptotically in the presence of such a reservoir. However, we also find that for any fixed number of probes used in the setup there exists a Gaussian dissipative reservoir, which, in principle, allows for the Heisenberg-limited performance for that number of probes. We discuss a realistic implementation of a frequency estimation scheme in the presence of a Gaussian dissipative reservoir in a cavity system.",0

123558,1,Non-Hermitian description of the dynamics of interchain pair tunneling We study interchain pair tunneling dynamics based on an exact two-particle solution for a two-leg ladder. We show that the Hermitian Hamiltonian shares a common two-particle eigenstate with a corresponding non-Hermitian Hubbard Hamiltonian in which the non-Hermiticity arises from an on-site interaction of imaginary strength. Our results provide that the dynamic processes of two-particle collision and cross-leg tunneling are well described by the effective non-Hermitian Hubbard Hamiltonian based on the eigenstate equivalence. We also find that any common eigenstate is always associated with the emergence of a spectral singularity in the non-Hermitian Hubbard model. This result is valid for both Bose and Fermi systems and provides a clear physical implication of the non-Hermitian Hubbard model.,0

123676,1,"Excitonic mass gap in uniaxially strained graphene We study the conditions for spontaneously generating an excitonic mass gap due to Coulomb interactions between anisotropic Dirac fermions in uniaxially strained graphene. The mass gap equation is realized as a self-consistent solution for the self-energy within the Hartree-Fock mean-field and static random phase approximations. It depends not only on momentum, due to the long-range nature of the interaction, but also on the velocity anisotropy caused by the presence of uniaxial strain. We solve the nonlinear integral equation self-consistently by performing large scale numerical calculations on variable grid sizes. We evaluate the mass gap at the charge neutrality (Dirac) point as a function of the dimensionless coupling constant and anisotropy parameter. We also obtain the phase diagram of the critical coupling, at which the gap becomes finite, against velocity anisotropy. Our numerical study indicates that with an increase in uniaxial strain in graphene the strength of critical coupling decreases, which suggests anisotropy supports formation of excitonic mass gap in graphene.",0
123679,1,"Computational complexity and 3-manifolds and zombies We show the problem of counting homomorphisms from the fundamental group of a homology $3$-sphere $M$ to a finite, non-abelian simple group $G$ is #P-complete, in the case that $G$ is fixed and $M$ is the computational input. Similarly, deciding if there is a non-trivial homomorphism is NP-complete. In both reductions, we can guarantee that every non-trivial homomorphism is a surjection. As a corollary, for any fixed integer $m \ge 5$, it is NP-complete to decide whether $M$ admits a connected $m$-sheeted covering. Our construction is inspired by universality results in topological quantum computation. Given a classical reversible circuit $C$, we construct $M$ so that evaluations of $C$ with certain initialization and finalization conditions correspond to homomorphisms $\pi_1(M) \to G$. An intermediate state of $C$ likewise corresponds to a homomorphism $\pi_1(\Sigma_g) \to G$, where $\Sigma_g$ is a pointed Heegaard surface of $M$ of genus $g$. We analyze the action on these homomorphisms by the pointed mapping class group $\text{MCG}_*(\Sigma_g)$ and its Torelli subgroup $\text{Tor}_*(\Sigma_g)$. By results of Dunfield-Thurston, the action of $\text{MCG}_*(\Sigma_g)$ is as large as possible when $g$ is sufficiently large; we can pass to the Torelli group using the congruence subgroup property of $\text{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})$. Our results can be interpreted as a sharp classical universality property of an associated combinatorial $(2+1)$-dimensional TQFT.",0
123695,1,"Charge Exchange Losses and Stochastic Acceleration in the Solar Wind Stochastic acceleration of particles under a pressure balance condition can accommodate the universal $p^{-5}$ spectra observed under many different conditions in the inner heliosphere. In this model, in order to avoid an infinite build up of particle pressure, a relationship between the momentum diffusion of particles and the adiabatic deceleration in the solar wind must exist. This constrains both the spatial and momentum diffusion coefficients and results in the $p^{-5}$ spectrum in the presence of adiabatic losses in the solar wind. However, this theory cannot explain the presence of such spectra beyond the termination shock, where adiabatic deceleration is negligible. To explain this apparent discrepancy, we include the effect of charge exchange losses, resulting in new forms of both the spatial and momentum diffusion coefficients that have not previously been considered. Assuming that the turbulence is of a large-scale compressible nature, we find that a balance between momentum diffusion and losses can still readily lead to the creation of $p^{-5}$ suprathermal tails, including those found in the outer heliosphere.",0

123750,1,"Numerical analysis of transient eddy-current flowmetering for liquid metals We present a comprehensive numerical analysis of transient eddy-current flowmetering method for liquid metals. This type of flowmeter operates by tracking eddy-current markers excited by the magnetic field pulses in the flow of a conducting liquid. Using a simple mathematical model, where the fluid flow is replaced by a translating cylinder, a number possible alternative measurement schemes are considered. The velocity of the medium can be measured by tracking zero crossing points and spatial or temporal extrema of the electromotive force (emf) induced by transient eddy currents in the surrounding space. Zero crossing points and spatial extrema of the emf travel synchronously with the medium whereas temporal extrema experience an initial time delay which depends on the conductivity and velocity of the medium. Performance of transient eddy-current flowmetering depends crucially on the symmetry of system. Eddy current asymmetry of a few per cent makes the detection point drift with a velocity corresponding to a magnetic Reynolds number $Rm\sim0.1.$ With this level of asymmetry transient eddy-current flowmetering can be reliably applicable only to flows with $Rm\gtrsim0.1.$ A more accurate symmetry adjustment or calibration of flowmeters may be necessary at lower velocities.",0

Measured delay time for nanosecond microwave pulse propagation through the photonic crystal is about 23 ns that is in good agreement with the value obtained by numerical simulation. This time delay value corresponds to the group velocity of microwave pulses in the photonic crystal $v_{gr}  \approx 0.11c$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.",0
123908,1,Electromagnetic-continuum-induced nonlinearity A nonrelativistic Hamiltonian describing interaction between a mechanical degree of freedom and radiation pressure is commonly used as an ultimate tool for studying system behavior in optomechanics. This Hamiltonian is derived from the equation of motion of a mechanical degree of freedom and the optical wave equation with time-varying boundary conditions. We show that this approach is deficient for studying higher-order nonlinear effects in an open resonant optomechanical system. Optomechanical interaction induces a large mechanical nonlinearity resulting from a strong dependence of the power of the light confined in the optical cavity on the mechanical degrees of freedom of the cavity due to coupling with electromagnetic continuum. This dissipative nonlinearity cannot be inferred from the standard Hamiltonian formalism.,0

124279,1,"An information theory model for dissipation in open quantum systems This work presents a general model for open quantum systems using an information game along the lines of Jaynes’ original work. It is shown how an energy based reweighting of propagators provides a novel moment generating function at each time point in the process. Derivatives of the generating function give moments of the time derivatives of observables. Aside from the mathematically helpful properties, the ansatz reproduces key physics of stochastic quantum processes. At high temperature, the average density matrix follows the Caldeira-Leggett equation. Its associated Langevin equation clearly demonstrates the emergence of dissipation and decoherence time scales, as well as an additional diffusion due to quantum confinement. A consistent interpretation of these results is that decoherence and wavefunction collapse during measurement are directly related to the degree of environmental noise, and thus occur because of subjective uncertainty of an observer.",0

For the concrete example of the Fulde-Ferrell phase we present a quantitative calculation of the superfluid density, showing not only that the collective-mode contributions are appreciable but also that they derive from the amplitude mode of the order parameter. This latter mode is generally viewed as being invisible in conventional superconductors.

124563,1,"On the late phase of relaxation of two-dimensional fluids: turbulence of unitons The two-dimensional ideal fluid and the plasma confined by a strong magnetic field exhibit an intrinsic tendency to organization due to the inverse spectral cascade. In the asymptotic states reached at relaxation the turbulence has vanished and there are only coherent vortical structures. We are interested in the regime that precedes these ordered flow patterns, in which there still is turbulence and imperfect but robust structures have emerged. To develop an analytical description we propose to start from the stationary coherent states and (in the direction opposite to relaxation) explore the space of configurations before the extremum of the functional that defines the structures has been reached. We find necessary to assemble different but related models: point-like vortices, its field theoretical formulation as interacting matter and gauge fields, chiral model and surfaces with constant mean curvature. These models are connected by the similar ability to described randomly interacting coherent structures. They derive exactly the same equation for the asymptotic state (sinh-Poisson equation, confirmed by numerical calculation of fluid flows). The chiral model, to which one can arrive from self-duality equation of the field theoretical model for fluid and from constant mean curvature surface equations, appears to be the suitable analytical framework. Its solutions, the unitons, aquire dynamics when the system is not at the extremum of the action. In the present work we provide arguments that the underlying common nature of these models can be used to develop an approach to fluid and plasma states of turbulence interacting with structures.",0
124578,1,"Observation of the topological edge state in X-ray band The possibility of obtaining robust edge state of light by mimicking the topological properties of solid state system, have brought a profound impact on optical sciences. With the advent of high-brilliance, accelerator-driven light sources such as storage rings or X-ray lasers, it has become attractive to extend the concept of optical topological manipulation to the X-ray regime. In this paper, we theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated the topological edge state at the interface of two photonic crystals having different band-gap topological characteristics for X-ray. Remarkably, this topologically protected edge state is immune to the weak disorder in form of the thickness disorder and strong disorder in form of the positional disorder of layers in the structure, as long as the zero-average-effective-mass condition is satisfied. Our investigation therefore brings the topological characteristics to the X-ray regime, provides new theoretical tools to study X-ray optics and may pave way to exploit some important potential applications, such as the high efficiency band filter in X-ray band.",0

We provide an analytical description of its functionality and demonstrate its capabilities on systematically controlled leptokurtic noise. Hereby, we investigate the properties of leptokurtic time series and their influence on the Fourier phases of time series. The phase walk analysis is applied to measured and simulated intermittent time series, whose probability density distribution are approximated by power laws. We use the day-to-day returns of the Dow-Jones industrial average, a synthetic time series with tailored nonlinearities mimicing the power law behavior of the Dow-Jones and the acceleration of wind at an Atlantic offshore site. Testing for nonlinearities by means of surrogates shows that the new method yields strong significances for nonlinear behavior. Due to the drastically decreased computing time as compared to embedding space methods the number of surrogate realizations can be increased by orders of magnitude. Thereby, the probability distribution of the test statistics can very accurately be derived and parametrized which allows for much more precise tests on nonlinearities.",0

124991,1,"The Fornax Cluster VLT Spectroscopic Survey II - Planetary Nebulae kinematics within 200 kpc of the cluster core We present the largest and most spatially extended planetary nebulae (PNe) catalog ever obtained for the Fornax cluster. We measured velocities of 1452 PNe out to 200 kpc in the cluster core using a counter-dispersed slitless spectroscopic technique with data from FORS2 on the VLT. With such extended spatial coverage, we can study separately the stellar halos of some of the cluster main galaxies and the intracluster light. In this second paper of the Fornax Cluster VLT Spectroscopic Survey (FVSS), we identify and classify the emission-line sources, describe the method to select PNe and calculate their coordinates and velocities from the dispersed slitless images. From the PN 2D velocity map we identify stellar streams that are possibly tracing the gravitational interaction of NGC1399 with NGC1404 and NGC1387. We also present the velocity dispersion profile out to $\sim 200$ kpc radii, which shows signatures of a superposition of the bright central galaxy and the cluster potential, with the latter clearly dominating the regions outside R $\sim 1000$"" ($\sim 100$ kpc).",0
125060,1,"Role of a fermion condensate in the structure of high-temperature pairing in cuprates The anomalous properties of a pairing gap in cuprate superconductors have been explained under the assumption that their electron systems in the normal phase exhibit a fermion condensate, i.e., a set of dispersionless states close to the nominal Fermi surface. It has been shown that exactly the fermion condensate is responsible for D-state pairing in cuprates. More specifically, the effective Coulomb repulsion in the Cooper channel, which prevents the existence of superconductivity in normal metals in the S channel, makes it high-temperature in the D channel.",0
125276,1,"Statistical mechanics of stochastic growth phenomena We develop statistical mechanics for stochastic growth processes and apply it to Laplacian growth by using its remarkable connection with a random matrix theory. The Laplacian growth equation is obtained from the variation principle and describes adiabatic (quasistatic) thermodynamic processes in the two-dimensional Dyson gas. By using Einstein's theory of thermodynamic fluctuations we consider transitional probabilities between thermodynamic states, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with simply connected domains occupied by gas. Transitions between these domains are described by the stochastic Laplacian growth equation, while the transitional probabilities coincide with a free-particle propagator on an infinite-dimensional complex manifold with a Kähler metric.",0

125447,1,"Modelling, controlling, predicting blackouts The electric power system is one of the cornerstones of modern society. One of its most serious malfunctions is the blackout, a catastrophic event that may disrupt a substantial portion of the system, playing havoc to human life and causing great economic losses. Thus, understanding the mechanisms leading to blackouts and creating a reliable and resilient power grid has been a major issue, attracting the attention of scientists, engineers and stakeholders. In this paper, we study the blackout problem in power grids by considering a practical phase-oscillator model. This model allows one to simultaneously consider different types of power sources (e.g., traditional AC power plants and renewable power sources connected by DC/AC inverters) and different types of loads (e.g., consumers connected to distribution networks and consumers directly connected to power plants). We propose two new control strategies based on our model, one for traditional power grids, and another one for smart grids. The control strategies show the efficient function of the fast-response energy storage systems in preventing and predicting blackouts in smart grids. This work provides innovative ideas which help us to build up a robuster and more economic smart power system.",0

In order to derive the spectral mapping theorem for the quaternionic Szegedy walk, we derive a quaternionic extension of the determinant expression of the second weighted zeta function of a graph. Our main results determine explicitly all the right eigenvalues of the quaternionic Szegedy walk by using complex right eigenvalues of the corresponding doubly weighted matrix. We also show the way to obtain eigenvectors corresponding to right eigenvalues derived from those of doubly weighted matrix.",0

125524,1,"The relation between stretched-exponential relaxation and the vibrational density of states in glassy disordered systems Amorphous solids or glasses are known to exhibit stretched-exponential decay over broad time intervals in several of their macroscopic observables: intermediate scattering function, dielectric relaxation modulus, time-elastic modulus etc. This behaviour is prominent especially near the glass transition. In this Letter we show, on the example of dielectric relaxation, that stretched-exponential relaxation is intimately related to the peculiar lattice dynamics of glasses. By reformulating the Lorentz model of dielectric matter in a more general form, we express the dielectric response as a function of the vibrational density of states (DOS) for a random assembly of spherical particles interacting harmonically with their nearest-neighbours. Surprisingly we find that near the glass transition for this system (which coincides with the Maxwell rigidity transition), the dielectric relaxation is perfectly consistent with stretched-exponential behaviour with Kohlrausch exponents $0.56 < \beta < 0.65$, which is the range where exponents are measured in most experimental systems. Crucially, the root cause of stretched-exponential relaxation can be traced back to soft modes (boson-peak) in the DOS.",0

The former case occurs for quadrangulations of self-dual type, and the zero-temperature critical point has central charge c=1. The latter case occurs for quadrangulations of non-self-dual type, and the critical point belongs to the universality class of the three-state Potts ferromagnet. We have tested this criterion against high-precision computations on four lattices of each type, with very good agreement. We have also found that the Wang-Swendsen-Kotecký algorithm has no critical slowing-down in the former case, and critical slowing-down in the latter.",0

126181,1,"Theory of avoided criticality in quantum motion in a random potential in high dimensions The density of states of a three-dimensional Dirac equation with a random potential as well as in other problems of quantum motion in a random potential placed in sufficiently high spatial dimensionality appears to be singular at a certain critical disorder strength. This was seen numerically in a variety of studies as well as supported by detailed renormalization group calculations. At the same time it was suggested by a number of arguments accompanied by detailed numerical simulations that this singularity is rounded off by the rare region fluctuations of random potential, and that tuning the disorder past its critical value is not a genuine phase transition but rather a crossover. Here we develop an analytic theory which explains how rare region effects indeed lead to rounding off of the singularity and to the crossover replacing the transition.",0
126336,1,"Spectrum of multi-region-relaxed magnetohydrodynamic modes in topologically toroidal geometry A general formulation of the problem of calculating the spectrum of stable and unstable eigenmodes of linearized perturbations about a magnetically confined toroidal plasma is presented. The analysis is based on a new hydromagnetic dynamical model, Multi-region Relaxed Magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD), which models the plasma-magnetic field system as consisting of multiple regions, containing compressible Euler fluid and Taylor-relaxed magnetic field, separated by flexible ideal-MHD current sheets. This is illustrated using a first-principles analysis of a two-region slab geometry, with periodic boundary conditions to model the outer regions of typical tokamak or reversed-field pinch plasmas. The lowest and second-lowest eigenvalues in plasmas unstable to tearing and kink-tearing modes are calculated. Very near marginal stability the lowest mode obtained using the incompressible approximation to the kinetic energy normalization of the present study is shown to correspond to the eigenvalues found in previous studies with less physical normalizations.",0

126557,1,"Towards a Time-Constrained Service-Oriented Architecture for Automation and Control in Large-Scale Dynamic Systems Rapidly changing demands for interoperability among heterogeneous systems leads to a paradigm shift from pre-defined control strategies to dynamic customization within many automation systems, e.g., large-scale scien-tific facilities. However, today's mass systems are of a very static nature. Fully changing the control process requires a high amount of expensive manual efforts and is quite error prone. Hence, flexibility will become a key factor in the future control systems. The adoption of web services and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) can provide the requested capability of flexibility. Since the adaptation of SOAs to automation systems has to face time-constrained requirements, particular attention should be paid to real-time web services for deterministic behaviour. This paper proposes a novel framework for the integration of a Time-Constrained SOA (TcSOA) into mass automation systems. Our design enables service encapsulation in filed level and evaluates how real time technologies can be synthesized with web services to enable deterministic performance.",0
126617,1,"A critical review of statistical calibration/prediction models handling data inconsistency and model inadequacy Inference of physical parameters from reference data is a well studied problem with many intricacies (inconsistent sets of data due to experimental systematic errors, approximate physical models...). The complexity is further increased when the inferred parameters are used to make predictions (virtual measurements) because parameters uncertainty has to be estimated in addition to parameters best value. The literature is rich in statistical models for the calibration/prediction problem, each having benefits and limitations. We review and evaluate standard and state-of-the-art statistical models in a common bayesian framework, and test them on synthetic and real datasets of temperature-dependent viscosity for the calibration of Lennard-Jones parameters of a Chapman-Enskog model.",0

We conjecture that these two algebras are infinite and present evidence in support of our conjectures. Finally, we list examples of knots that have the same even and odd Khovanov homology, but different actions of these homological operations. This confirms that the unified theory is a finer knot invariant than the even and odd Khovanov homology combined. The case of reduced Khovanov homology is also considered.",0
126772,1,"Perpendicular and parallel diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in the presence of adiabatic focusing Understanding stochastic diffusion of energetic charged particles in non-uniform background magnetic field is one of the major problems in plasmas of space and fusion devices. In this paper by using the improved perturbation method developed by He \& Schlickeiser starting from the modified Fokker-Planck equation of energetic charged particles we derive an isotropic distribution function equation with the infinite self-iteration of anisotropic distribution function $g(\mu)$. And then a new perpendicular and parallel diffusion coefficients are obtained which include the infinite self-iteration effect. It is demonstrated that the form of perpendicular diffusion coefficient is form-invariable for the infinite self-iteration effect, but the parallel diffusion coefficient is modified by it. And for simplification by using the simple pitch-angle diffusion model $D_{\mu\mu}=d$ ($d$ is a constant) we find that the modifying factor to parallel diffusion coefficient coming from the infinite self-iteration effect need to be considered at least for the simple model. We also find that the parallel diffusion coefficient derived in some previous papers is the special case of which is obtained in this paper.",0

126928,1,"Observation of global electromagnetic resonances by low- orbiting satellites Penetration of Schumann resonances energy from the Earth-ionosphere resonance cavity into the circumterrestrial space is examined. This study focuses on estimates of Alfvén wave amplitude and spectra in the frequency range of 7-50 Hz which can be observed by low-orbiting satellites. Differences in Schumann resonances observation conditions between the nighttime and sunlit sides of the ionosphere are analyzed. Particular emphasis has been placed on the ionospheric Alfvén resonator (IAR) excited by both global thunderstorm activity and individual lightning discharges. IAR spectra in the frequency range of 0.5-10 Hz are calculated for ionospheric altitudes. The calculated spectral amplitudes of IAR and Schumann resonances are compatible with C/NOFS satellite observations. To explain a shift of IAR resonant frequencies observed during C/NOFS satellite passage through terminator region, the IAR model is developed in which an interference of Alfvén waves reflected from the ionospheric E-layer and the IAR upper boundary is taken into account.",0

127063,1,"Collaboration and decision making tools for mobile groups Nowadays the use of distributed collaboration tools is widespread in many areas of people activity.

Hence, realization of special infrastructures on mobile platforms with help of ad-hoc wireless local networks could eliminate hardware-attachment and be useful also in terms of scientific approach. Solutions from basic internet-messengers to complex software for online collaboration equipment in large-scale workgroups are implementations of tools based on mobile infrastructures.

127304,1,"Zinc and Copper Effects on Stability of Tubulin and Actin Networks in Dendrites and Spines of Hippocampal Neurons Zinc and copper ions can modulate the activity of glutamate receptors. However, labile zinc and copper ions likely represent only the tip of the iceberg and other neuronal functions are suspected for these metals in their bound state. We performed synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging with 30 nm resolution to image total biometals in dendrites and spines from hippocampal neurons. We found that zinc is distributed all along the dendrites while copper is mainly pinpointed within the spines. In spines, zinc content is higher within the spine head while copper is higher within the spine neck. Such specific distributions suggested metal interactions with cytoskeleton proteins. Zinc supplementation induced the increase of β-tubulin content in dendrites. Copper supplementation impaired the β-tubulin and F-actin networks. Copper chelation resulted in the decrease of F-actin content in dendrites, drastically reducing the number of F-actin protrusions. These results indicate that zinc is involved in microtubule stability whereas copper is essential for actin-dependent stability of dendritic spines, although copper excess can impair the dendritic cytoskeleton.",0
127559,1,"Dynamic principle for ensemble control tools Dynamical equations describing physical systems at statistical equilibrium are commonly extended by mathematical tools called ""thermostats"".

It is based on fundamental physical assumptions such that the canonical measure is invariant for the thermostat dynamics. This is a clear advantage over a range of recently proposed and widely discussed in the literature mathematical thermostat schemes. Following justification of the proposed principle we show its generality and usefulness for modeling a wide range of natural systems.",0

These solitary waves provide a natural implementation of qubit and qudit states in the theory of quantum computing. We show the relation of $\pm 2\omega\mathrm{i}$ eigenvalues of the linearization at a solitary wave, Bogoliubov $\mathbf{SU}(1,1)$ symmetry, and the existence of bi-frequency solitary waves.

The quantum Zeno effect inhibits transport and induces localization. Beyond the Zeno freezing and on long time scales, a new dynamics emerges in the form of a Markov process. Studying fermionic and bosonic chains under strong monitoring, we are able to identify the quantum origin of the classical exclusion process, inclusion process and a sub-class of the misanthrope process. Moreover, we show that passive monitoring cannot break time-reversal symmetry and that the transport generally loses its ballistic nature existing for weak measurements.",0
127784,1,"Generation and control of noncollinear magnetism by supercurrent When superconductivity couples with noncollinear spin textures, rich physics arises, for instance, singlet Cooper pairs can be converted to triplet pairs, and topological superconductors can be realized. For their applications, the controllability of noncollinear magnetism is a crucial issue. Here, we propose that a supercurrent can induce and control noncollinear magnetic orders in a correlated metal on top of a singlet superconductor. We show that the magnetic instability in the correlated metal is enhanced by the proximity effect of supercurrents, which leads to phase transitions from a paramagnetic state to noncollinear magnetic phases with helical or vortexlike spin textures. Furthermore, these magnetic orders can be switched by the direction of the supercurrent. We also discuss the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the experimental realization.",0
127882,1,"Unified path integral approach to theories of diffusion-influenced reactions Building on mathematical similarities between quantum mechanics and theories of diffusion-influenced reactions, we develop a general approach for computational modeling of diffusion-influenced reactions that is capable of capturing not only the classical Smoluchowski picture but also alternative theories, as is here exemplified by a volume reactivity model. In particular, we prove the path decomposition expansion of various Green's functions describing the irreversible and reversible reaction of an isolated pair of molecules. To this end, we exploit a connection between boundary value and interaction potential problems with δ- and δ′-function perturbation. We employ a known path-integral-based summation of a perturbation series to derive a number of exact identities relating propagators and survival probabilities satisfying different boundary conditions in a unified and systematic manner. Furthermore, we show how the path decomposition expansion represents the propagator as a product of three factors in the Laplace domain that correspond to quantities figuring prominently in stochastic spatially resolved simulation algorithms. This analysis will thus be useful for the interpretation of current and the design of future algorithms. Finally, we discuss the relation between the general approach and the theory of Brownian functionals and calculate the mean residence time for the case of irreversible and reversible reactions.",0
127915,1,"Mean-field theory of turbulence from the variational principle and its application to the rotation of a thin fluid disk A new mean-field theory of turbulence that treats the effective viscosity as a dynamical degree of freedom is presented on the basis of the stationary action principle, and is shown to reproduce some experiments for the mean flow profile of turbulence in the laboratory. Comparison with eddy viscosity models is also made. Then, with the help of the viscosity expansion method, the theory is applied to a rotating thin fluid disk for the purpose of evaluating the viscosity effect in the dynamics of a spiral galaxy or protoplanetary nebula. We find two types of physically interesting solution. In the first type, the rotation curve at long distances from the disk center is flat as a natural feature of the rotating viscous fluid with neither strong radial motion nor radial pressure gradient. The flow is gravitationally maintained only when a sufficient amount of matter other than viscous fluid is present. In the second type, the rotation is Keplerian with a centrally localized mass distribution. In both types of solution, the effective viscosity tends to act to stabilize perturbation in the region of shorter distances.",0
127995,1,"Perturbative approach to weakly driven many-particle systems in the presence of approximate conservation laws We develop a Liouville perturbation theory for weakly driven and weakly open quantum systems in situations when the unperturbed system has a number of conservations laws. If the perturbation violates the conservation laws, it drives the system to a new steady state which can be approximately but efficiently described by a (generalized) Gibbs ensemble characterized by one Lagrange parameter for each conservation law. The value of those has to be determined from rate equations for conserved quantities. Remarkably, even weak perturbations can lead to large responses of conserved quantities. We present a perturbative expansion of the steady state density matrix; first we give the condition that fixes the zeroth-order expression (Lagrange parameters) and then determine the higher-order corrections via projections of the Liouvillian. The formalism can be applied to a wide range of problems including two-temperature models for electron-phonon systems, Bose condensates of excitons or photons, or weakly perturbed integrable models. We test our formalism by studying interacting fermions coupled to nonthermal reservoirs, approximately described by a Boltzmann equation.",0

We obtain a striking dependence of $t_{\rm Th}$ on the spatial dimension $d$ and size of the system. For $d>1$, $t_{\rm Th}$ is finite in the thermodynamic limit and set by the inter-site coupling strength. By contrast, in one dimension $t_{\rm Th}$ diverges with system size, and for large systems there is a wide window in which spectral correlations are not of RMT form.",0

128210,1,Nuclear Spin Noise in the Central Spin Model We study theoretically the spin fluctuations of nuclei in quantum dots. We employ the central spin model which accounts for the hyperfine interaction of the nuclei with the electron spin.

These results are in good agreement with numerical simulations. We demonstrate that in rather high magnetic field the nuclear spin noise spectra has a two-peak structure centered at the nuclear Zeeman frequency with the shape of the spectrum controlled by the distribution of the hyperfine constants.,0
128373,1,"Dimension-Dependent Stimulated Radiative Interaction of a Single Electron Quantum Wavepacket In the foundation of quantum mechanics, the spatial dimensions of electron wavepacket are understood only in terms of an expectation value - the probability distribution of the particle location. One can still inquire how the quantum electron wavepacket size affects a physical process. Here we address the fundamental physics problem of particle-wave duality and the measurability of a free electron quantum wavepacket. Our analysis of stimulated radiative interaction of an electron wavepacket, accompanied by numerical computations, reveals two limits. In the quantum regime of long wavepacket size relative to radiation wavelength, one obtains only quantum-recoil multiphoton sidebands in the electron energy spectrum. In the opposite regime, the wavepacket interaction approaches the limit of classical point-particle acceleration. The wavepacket features can be revealed in experiments carried out in the intermediate regime of wavepacket size commensurate with the radiation wavelength.",0

We extend most of the existing results with characterisations in terms of dual infinitesimal generators of the corresponding strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups.

128656,1,"A systematic search of knot and link invariants beyond modular data The smallest known example of a family of modular categories that is not determined by its modular data are the rank 49 categories $\mathcal{Z}(\text{Vec}_G^{\omega})$ for $G=\mathbb{Z}_{11} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_{5}$. However, these categories can be distinguished with the addition of a matrix of invariants called the $W$-matrix that contains intrinsic information about punctured $S$-matrices.

128868,1,"Monogamy of quantum entanglement in time In this paper we state a fundamental question about the structure of correlations in time and analyze temporal monogamy relations. We show that the nature of temporal correlations is inherently different from the spatial ones but in similarity to quantum spatial correlations, we expose a phenomenon of monogamy of quantum entanglement in time. We perform this task applying the entangled histories framework as a modifcation of the consistent histories approach. These considerations are supported by introduction of necessary tools specific for the tensor algebra used for representation of spatial correlations. We show that Tsirelson bound on temporal Bell-like inequalities can be derived from the entangled histories approach. Finally, we point out that in a context of the tensor algebra used for linking states in different times further studies on mathematical structure of the state representing evolving systems are needed.",0
128976,1,"The influence of outflow and global magnetic field on the structure and spectrum of resistive CDAFs We examine the effects of a global magnetic field and outflow on radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) in the presence of magnetic resistivity. We find a self-similar solutions for the height integrated equations that govern the behavior of the flow. We use the mixing length mechanism for studying the convection parameter. We adopt a radius dependent mass accretion rate as $\dot{M}=\dot{M}_{out}{(\frac{r}{r_{out}})^{s}}$ with $s> 0$ to investigate the influence of outflow on the structure of inflow where $s$ is a constant and indication the effect of wind. Also, we have studied the radiation spectrum and temperature of CDAFs. The thermal bermsstrahlung emission as a radiation mechanism is taken into account for calculating the spectra emitted by the CDAFs. The energy that powers bremsstrahlung emission at large radii is provided by convective transport from small radii and viscous and resistivity dissipation. Our results indicate that the disc rotates slower and accretes faster, it becomes hotter and thicker for stronger wind. By increasing all component of magnetic field, the disc rotates faster and accretes slower while it becomes hotter and thicker. We show that the outflow parameter and all component of magnetic field have the same effects on the luminosity of the disc. We compare the dynamical structure of the disc in two different solutions (with and without resistivity parameter). We show that only the radial infall velocity and the surface density could changed by resistivity parameter obviously. Increasing the effect of wind increases the disc's temperature and luminosity of the disc. The effect of magnetic field is similar to the effect of wind in the disc's temperature and luminosity of the disc, but the influence of resistivity on the observational properties is not evident.",0

129033,1,"Energy efficiency of large scale graph processing platforms A number of graph processing platforms have emerged recently as a result of the growing demand on graph data analytics with complex and large-scale graph structured datasets. These platforms have been tailored for iterative graph computations and can offer an order of magnitude performance gain over generic data-flow frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Spark. Nevertheless, the increasing availability of such platforms and their functionality overlap necessitates a comparative study on various aspects of the platforms, including applications, performance and energy efficiency. In this work, we focus on the energy efficiency aspect of some large scale graph processing platforms. Specifically, we select two representatives, e.g., Apache Giraph and Spark GraphX, for the comparative study. We compare and analyze the energy consumption of these two platforms with PageRank, Strongly Connected Component and Single Source Shortest Path algorithms over five different realistic graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that GraphX outperforms Giraph in terms of energy consumption. Specifically, Giraph consumes 1.71 times more energy than GraphX on average for the mentioned algorithms.",0
129042,1,"Nanoscale mapping of ultrafast magnetization dynamics with femtosecond Lorentz microscopy Novel time-resolved imaging techniques for the investigation of ultrafast nanoscale magnetization dynamics are indispensable for further developments in light-controlled magnetism. Here, we introduce femtosecond Lorentz microscopy, achieving a spatial resolution below 100 nm and a temporal resolution of 700 fs, which gives access to the transiently excited state of the spin system on femtosecond timescales and its subsequent relaxation dynamics. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by spatio-temporally mapping the light-induced demagnetization of a single magnetic vortex structure and quantitatively extracting the evolution of the magnetization field after optical excitation. Tunable electron imaging conditions allow for an optimization of spatial resolution or field sensitivity, enabling future investigations of ultrafast internal dynamics of magnetic topological defects on 10-nanometer length scales.",0

This symmetry facilitates a new class of counter-propagating Hall states at opposite but equal electron and hole filling factors $|\nu_{\pm}|=1/m$ ({\it m} odd). Here, we propose a Laughlin-like correlated liquid wavefunction, at the charge neutrality point, that exhibits fractionally charged quasi-particle/hole pair excitation of opposite parity. Using a bosonized one-dimensional edge state theory, we show that the longitudinal conductance of this state, $\sigma_{xx} = 2e^2/(m h)$, is robust to short-ranged inter-mode interactions.",0
129345,1,"Could the physical world be emergent instead of fundamental, and why should we ask? (full version) According to the received conception of physics, a valid physical theory is presumed to describe the objective evolution of a unique external world. However, this assumption is challenged by quantum theory, which indicates that physical systems do not always have objective properties which are simply revealed by measurement. Furthermore, several other conceptual puzzles in the foundations of physics and related fields point to possible limitations of the received perspective and motivate the exploration of alternatives. Thus, here I propose an alternative approach which starts with the concept of ""observation"" as its primary notion, and does not from the outset assume the existence of a ""world"" or physical laws. It can be subsumed under a single postulate: Solomonoff induction correctly predicts future observations. I show that the resulting theory suggests a possible explanation for why there are simple computable probabilistic laws in the first place. It predicts the emergence of the notion of an objective external world that has begun in a state of low entropy. It also predicts that observers will typically see the violation of Bell inequalities despite the validity of the no-signalling principle. Moreover, it resolves cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem via a ""principle of persistent regularities"", and it makes the unusual prediction that the emergent notion of objective external world breaks down in certain extreme situations, yielding phenomena such as ""probabilistic zombies"". Additionally, it makes in principle concrete predictions for some fundamental conceptual problems relating to the computer simulation of observers. This paper does not claim to exactly describe ""how the world works"", but it dares to raise the question of whether the first-person perspective may be a more fruitful starting point from which to address certain longstanding fundamental issues.",0

When pumped with a mode-locked laser frequency comb, these waveguides can coherently expand the comb spectrum to more than an octave in bandwidth to enable self-referenced stabilization. However, for applications in frequency metrology and precision spectroscopy, it is desirable to not only support self-referencing, but also to generate low-noise combs with customizable broadband spectra. In this work, we demonstrate dispersion-engineered waveguides based on silicon nitride that are designed to meet these goals and enable precision optical metrology experiments across large wavelength spans. We perform a clock comparison measurement and report a clock-limited relative frequency instability of $3.8\times10^{-15}$ at $\tau = 2$ seconds between a 1550 nm cavity-stabilized reference laser and NIST's calcium atomic clock laser at 657 nm using a two-octave waveguide-supercontinuum comb.",0

129927,1,"Flow and filtration imaging of single use sterile membrane filters Sterile filters incorporating endotoxin adsorption function emerged recently to pretreat dialysate liquids fed to a hemodialysis filtration process. Their application significantly enhances the survival rate during dialysis treatment as they function as sterile filters as well as an endotoxin adsorber. Little is known about the fluid flow distribution in such single use membrane modules. We report a detailed analysis of the local 3D flow field distribution in such membrane modules using magnetic resonance flow imaging. Next to pure water filtration representing the application case of endotoxin adsorption from an already pure liquid, we also used the module as a filtration device rejecting for instance colloidal silica. Such experiments performed in-situ allow the quantification of cake layer development and its concomitant redistribution of the flow field. Particularly novel is the quantification of the time evolution of local permeate flux distribution. These detailed insights of this study encourage the use of flow-MRI when designing and applying new membrane module configurations.",0

Our main result concerns the Stokes data of a certain meromorphic connection, whose isomonodromic deformations are controlled by these equations. Exploiting a framework introduced by Boalch, we show that this data has a remarkable structure, which can be described using Kostant's theory of Cartan subalgebras in apposition and Steinberg's theory of conjugacy classes of regular elements. A by-product of this is a convenient visualization of the orbit structure of the roots under the action of a Coxeter element. As an application, we compute canonical Stokes data of certain solutions of the tt*-Toda equations in terms of their asymptotics.",0
130333,1,"Bypass rewiring and robustness of complex networks A concept of bypass rewiring is introduced, and random bypass rewiring is analytically and numerically investigated with simulations. Our results show that bypass rewiring makes networks robust against removal of nodes including random failures and attacks. In particular, random bypass rewiring connects all nodes except the removed nodes on an even degree infinite network and makes the percolation threshold 0 for arbitrary occupation probabilities. In our example, the even degree network is more robust than the original network with random bypass rewiring, while the original network is more robust than the even degree networks without random bypass. We propose a greedy bypass rewiring algorithm which guarantees the maximum size of the largest component at each step, assuming which node will be removed next is unknown. The simulation result shows that the greedy bypass rewiring algorithm improves the robustness of the autonomous system of the Internet under attacks more than random bypass rewiring.",0
130354,1,"New equation for lagrangian incompressible fluid flows applied to turbulence Theoretical developments in the field of Lagrangian turbulence are made difficult by the fact that equations governing the evolution of lagrangian flows are implicit contrary to eulerian flows. In this article, an {\it exact} explicit equation for incompressible lagrangian fluid flows at high-Reynolds number is constructed. The method to arrive at the equation of motion and the proof that it describes the motion of an incompressible fluid are provided. A truncated version of this new equation is used to show how the lagrangian turbulent spectrum ($E_\mathrm{lag}(\omega)$) could be inferred. This exercise showed a complex interrelation between the stirring force field and the flow itself in the lagrangian turbulence framework whereas the stirring is not affected by the flow in the eulerian point of view. The result is that $E_\mathrm{lag}(\omega)\propto \varepsilon\,\omega^{-2}$ seems independent upon the way the fluid is stirred in the inertial range for a given dissipated power $\varepsilon$. It also showed that $E_\mathrm{lag}(\omega)\sim \omega^{-s}$ with $0\leq s\leq 1/2$ (depending on the stirring) at low-$\omega$ and $\sim\omega^{-4}$ in the viscous range at high-$\omega$.",0

130422,1,"On the Limited Sizes of Dusty Starbursting Regions at High Redshifts Using the far-infrared data obtained by the Herschel Space Observatory, we study the relation between the infrared luminosity (L_IR) and the dust temperature (T) of dusty starbursting galaxies at high redshifts (high-z). We focus on the total infrared luminosity from the cold-dust component (L_IR^(cd)), whose emission can be described by a modified black body (MBB) of a single temperature (T_mbb). An object on the (L_IR^(cd), T_mbb) plane can be explained by the equivalent of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a MBB with an effective radius of R_eff. We show that R_eff is a good measure of the combined size of the dusty starbursting regions (DSBRs) of the host galaxy. In at least one case where the individual DSBRs are well resolved through strong gravitational lensing, R_eff is consistent with the direct size measurement. We show that the observed L_IR-T relation is simply due to the limited R_eff (<~ 2 kpc). The small R_eff values also agree with the compact sizes of the DSBRs seen in the local universe. However, previous interferometric observations to resolve high-z dusty starbursting galaxies often quote much larger sizes. This inconsistency can be reconciled by the blending effect when considering that the current interferometry might still not be of sufficient resolution. From R_eff we infer the lower limits to the volume densities of the star formation rate (""minSFR3D"") in the DSBRs, and find that the $L_{IR}$-$T$ relation outlines a boundary on the (L_IR^(cd), T) plane, below which is the ""zone of avoidance"" in terms of minSFR3D.",0
130645,1,"Escape rate of Brownian particles from a metastable potential well under time derivative Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise We investigate the escape rate of Brownian particles that move in a cubic metastable potential subjected to an internal time derivative Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise (DOUN). This noise can induce the ballistic diffusion of force-free Brownian particles. Some new features are found. The escape rate for DOUN shows qualitative different dependence on potential well width compared with OUN which induces normal diffusion. As the potential barrier height decreases, the escape rate of DOUN deviates from Arrhenius law considerably earlier than that of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise (OUN). The Brownian particles escape faster under DOUN than that under OUN. A quasi-periodic oscillation occurs in transient state. A solvable case is presented to demonstrate the significant cancellation behavior in the barrier region that governs most of these phenomena. The physical mechanism of the findings can be clarified by the noise features. These characteristics should be common for internal noises that induce superdiffusion, especially the ballistic diffusion.",0

131434,1,"Gluing Bartnik extensions, continuity of the Bartnik mass, and the equivalence of definitions In the context of the Bartnik mass, there are two fundamentally different notions of an extension of some compact Riemannian manifold $(\Omega,\gamma)$ with boundary. In one case, the extension is taken to be a manifold without boundary in which $(\Omega,\gamma)$ embeds isometrically, and in the other case the extension is taken to be a manifold with boundary where the boundary data is determined by $\partial \Omega$. We give a type of convexity condition under which we can say both of these types of extensions indeed yield the same value for the Bartnik mass. Under the same hypotheses we prove that the Bartnik mass varies continuously with respect to the boundary data. This also provides a method to use estimates for the Bartnik mass of constant mean curvature (CMC) Bartnik data, to obtain estimates for the Bartnik mass of non-CMC Bartnik data. The key idea for these results is a method for gluing Bartnik extensions of given Bartnik data to other nearby Bartnik data.",0
131469,1,"X-ray Scintillation in Lead Halide Perovskite Crystals Current technologies for X-ray detection rely on scintillation from expensive inorganic crystals grown at high-temperature, which so far has hindered the development of large-area scintillator arrays. Thanks to the presence of heavy atoms, solution-grown hybrid lead halide perovskite single crystals exhibit short X-ray absorption length and excellent detection efficiency. Here we compare X-ray scintillator characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 and two-dimensional (2D) (EDBE)PbCl4 hybrid perovskite crystals. X-ray excited thermoluminescence measurements indicate the absence of deep traps and a very small density of shallow trap states, which lessens after-glow effects. All perovskite single crystals exhibit high X-ray excited luminescence yields of >120,000 photons/MeV at low temperature. Although thermal quenching is significant at room temperature, the large exciton binding energy of 2D (EDBE)PbCl4 significantly reduces thermal effects compared to 3D perovskites, and moderate light yield of 9,000 photons/MeV can be achieved even at room temperature. This highlights the potential of 2D metal halide perovskites for large-area and low-cost scintillator devices for medical, security and scientific applications.",0
131540,1,"Non-linear tides in a homogeneous rotating planet or star: global modes and elliptical instability We revisit the global modes and instabilities of homogeneous rotating ellipsoidal fluid masses, which are the simplest global models of rotationally and tidally deformed gaseous planets or stars. The tidal flow in a short-period planet may be unstable to the elliptical instability, a hydrodynamic instability that can drive tidal evolution. We perform a global (and local WKB) analysis to study this instability using the elegant formalism of Lebovitz & Lifschitz. We survey the parameter space of global instabilities with harmonic orders ℓ ≤ 5, for planets with spins that are purely aligned (prograde) or anti-aligned (retrograde) with their orbits. In general, the instability has a much larger growth rate if the planetary spin and orbit are anti-aligned rather than aligned. We have identified a violent instability for anti-aligned spins outside of the usual frequency range for the elliptical instability (when $\frac{n}{\Omega }\lesssim -1$, where n and Ω are the orbital and spin angular frequencies, respectively) if the tidal amplitude is sufficiently large. We also explore the instability in a rigid ellipsoidal container, which is found to be quantitatively similar to that with a realistic free surface. Finally, we study the effect of rotation and tidal deformation on mode frequencies. We find that larger rotation rates and larger tidal deformations both decrease the frequencies of the prograde sectoral surface gravity modes. This increases the prospect of their tidal excitation, potentially enhancing the tidal response over expectations from linear theory. In a companion paper, we use our results to interpret global simulations of the elliptical instability.",0

Concept validation with ZELDA on VLT/SPHERE Warm or massive gas giant planets, brown dwarfs, and debris disks around nearby stars are now routinely observed by dedicated high-contrast imaging instruments that are mounted on large, ground-based observatories. These facilities include extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) and state-of-the-art coronagraphy to achieve unprecedented sensitivities for exoplanet detection and their spectral characterization. However, low spatial frequency differential aberrations between the ExAO sensing path and the science path represent critical limitations for the detection of giant planets with a contrast lower than a few 10^-6 at very small separations ('') from their host star. In our previous work, we proposed a wavefront sensor based on Zernike phase-contrast methods to circumvent this problem and measure these quasi-static aberrations at a nanometric level. We present the design, manufacturing, and testing of ZELDA, a prototype that was installed on VLT/SPHERE during its reintegration in Chile. Using the internal light source of the instrument, we first performed measurements in the presence of Zernike or Fourier modes introduced with the deformable mirror. Our experimental results are consistent with the results in simulations, confirming the ability of our sensor to measure small aberrations ('', reaching the raw contrast limit set by the coronagraph in the instrument. In addition to this encouraging result, the simplicity of the design and its phase reconstruction algorithm makes ZELDA an excellent candidate for the online measurements of quasi-static aberrations during the observations.

131864,1,"Depinning and nonequilibrium dynamic phases of particle assemblies driven over random and ordered substrates: a review We review the depinning and nonequilibrium phases of collectively interacting particle systems driven over random or periodic substrates. This type of system is relevant to vortices in type-II superconductors, sliding charge density waves, electron crystals, colloids, stripe and pattern forming systems, and skyrmions, and could also have connections to jamming, glassy behaviors, and active matter. These systems are also ideal for exploring the broader issues of characterizing transient and steady state nonequilibrium flow phases as well as nonequilibrium phase transitions between distinct dynamical phases, analogous to phase transitions between different equilibrium states. We discuss the differences between elastic and plastic depinning on random substrates and the different types of nonequilibrium phases which are associated with specific features in the velocity-force curves, fluctuation spectra, scaling relations, and local or global particle ordering. We describe how these quantities can change depending on the dimension, anisotropy, disorder strength, and the presence of hysteresis. Within the moving phase we discuss how there can be a transition from a liquid-like state to dynamically ordered moving crystal, smectic, or nematic states. Systems with periodic or quasiperiodic substrates can have multiple nonequilibrium second or first order transitions in the moving state between chaotic and coherent phases, and can exhibit hysteresis. We also discuss systems with competing repulsive and attractive interactions, which undergo dynamical transitions into stripes and other complex morphologies when driven over random substrates. Throughout this work we highlight open issues and future directions such as absorbing phase transitions, nonequilibrium work relations, inertia, the role of non-dissipative dynamics such as Magnus effects, and how these results could be extended to the broader issues of plasticity in crystals, amorphous solids, and jamming phenomena.",0

At zero temperature, it is found that the condensate density $n_c(0)$ of Cooper pairs is of the order $n_c(0)\simeq 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ , consistently with the fact that a small fraction of the total p holes participate in pairing. We find that the phonon velocity c(0) at zero temperature is of the order $c(0)\simeq 10$ km s$^{-1}$ . The computation shows that the transition temperature $T_c$ is a dome-shaped function of the p hole concentration $\delta $ , which is consistent with experiments. At finite temperature, we find that the condensate fraction $n_c(T)/n$ decreases continuously from $n_c(0)/n$ to zero as the temperature increases from zero to the transition temperature $T_c$ . For higher temperatures, we find that the repulsive interaction between Cooper pairs drives more Cooper pairs into the condensate. The computation reveals that the phonon velocity c(T) decreases continuously from c(0) to zero as the temperature increases from zero to the transition temperature $T_c$ .

132028,1,"Fractional charge oscillations in quantum dots with quantum spin Hall effect We show that correlated two-particle backscattering can induce fractional charge oscillations in a quantum dot built at the edge of a two-dimensional topological insulator by means of magnetic barriers. The result nicely complements recent works where those fractional oscillations were predicted in the strong-coupling regime. Moreover, since by rotating the magnetization of the barriers a fractional charge can be trapped in the dot via the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism, the system we analyze offers the opportunity to study the interplay between this noninteracting charge fractionalization and the fractionalization due to two-particle backscattering. We demonstrate that the number of fractional oscillations of the charge density depends on the magnetization angle. In fact, a rotating magnetization can add or subtract fractional charges from the dot continuously. Finally, we address the renormalization induced by two-particle backscattering on the spin density, which is characterized by a dominant oscillation with a length twice as large as the charge-density oscillations.",0

Different methods exist to simulate wind power generation but they often cannot represent the crucial temporal fluctuations properly. We apply the concept of additive binary Markov chains to model a wind generation time series consisting of two states: periods of high and low wind generation. The only input parameter for this model is the empirical autocorrelation function. The two-state model is readily extended to stochastically reproduce the actual generation per period. To evaluate the additive binary Markov chain method, we introduce a coarse model of the electric power system to derive backup and storage needs. We find that the temporal correlations of wind power generation, the backup need as a function of the storage capacity, and the resting time distribution of high and low wind events for different shares of wind generation can be reconstructed.",0

We apply our procedure to the extensive far-UV-to-far-IR photometric data of M51, convolved to a common spatial resolution and pixel scale, and make the resulting maps publicly available. We recover, for M51a, a peak star formation rate (SFR) between 0.1 and 5 Gyr ago, with much lower star formation activity over the past 100 Myr. For M51b, we find a declining SFR toward the present day. In the outskirt regions of M51a, which includes regions between M51a and M51b, we recover an SFR peak between 0.1 and 1 Gyr ago, which corresponds to the effects of the interaction between M51a and M51b. We utilize our results to (1) illustrate how UV+IR hybrid SFR laws vary across M51 and (2) provide first-order estimates for how the IR luminosity per unit stellar mass varies as a function of the stellar age. From the latter result, we find that IR emission from dust heated by stars is not always associated with young stars and that the IR emission from M51b is primarily powered by stars older than 5 Gyr.",0

132464,1,"Composite electronic orders induced by orbital Kondo effect In a large number of rare-earth and actinide systems, Kondo effect tends to suppress magnetic order by making the spin singlet between localized and conduction electron spins. In the presence of orbital degrees of freedom, however, there emerge exotic electronic orders induced by Kondo effect. The orbital Kondo effect can collectively make diagonal and off-diagonal (superconducting) orders. With the particle-hole symmetry in conduction bands, these orders are all degenerate, forming a macroscopic SO(5) multiplet. This paper discusses recent theoretical development on these electronic orders which are relevant to Pr$^{3+}$ and U$^{4+}$ systems with even number of $f$ electrons per site. In the superconducting order, each conduction-electron pair is coupled with local degrees of freedom, forming a composite entity with a staggered spatial pattern. The quasi-particle spectrum is best interpreted as virtual hybridization with resonant states at the Fermi level. Possible order parameter for URu$_2$Si$_2$ in the hidden order state is discussed in the context of composite orders. Briefly discussed are related issues such as homogeneous odd-frequency pairing and SO(5) theory for high-temperature superconductors.",0
132558,1,"Modified spin-wave theory and spin-liquid behavior of cold bosons on an inhomogeneous triangular lattice Ultracold bosons in a triangular lattice are a promising candidate for observing quantum spin liquid behavior. Here we investigate, for such system, the role of a harmonic trap giving rise to an inhomogeneous density. We construct a modified spin-wave theory for arbitrary filling and predict the breakdown of order for certain values of the lattice anisotropy. These regimes, identified with the spin liquid phases, are found to be quite robust upon changes in the filling factor. This result is backed by an exact diagonalization study on a small lattice.",0
132577,1,"Alice in Triangleland: Lewis Carroll's Pillow Problem and Variants Solved on Shape Space of Triangles We provide a natural answer to Lewis Carroll's pillow problem of what is the probability that a triangle is obtuse, Prob(Obtuse). This arises by straightforward combination of a) Kendall's Theorem - that the space of all triangles is a sphere - and b) the natural map sending triangles in space to points in this shape sphere. The answer is 3/4. Our method moreover readily generalizes to a wider class of problems, since a) and b) both have many applications and admit large generalizations: Shape Theory. An elementary and thus widely accessible prototype for Shape Theory is thereby desirable, and extending Kendall's already-notable prototype a) by demonstrating that b) readily solves Lewis Carroll's well-known pillow problem indeed provides a memorable and considerably stronger prototype. This is a prototype of, namely, mapping flat geometry problems directly realized in a space to shape space, where differential-geometric tools are readily available to solve the problem and then finally re-interpret it in the original `shape-in-space' terms. We illustrate this program's versatility by posing and solving a number of variants of the pillow problem. We first find Prob(Isosceles is Obtuse). We subsequently define tall and flat triangles, as bounded by regular triangles whose base-to-median ratio is that of the equilateral triangle. These definitions have Jacobian and Hopfian motivation as well as entering Kendall's own considerations of `splinters': almost-collinear triangles. We find that Prob(Tall) = 1/2 = Prob(Flat) is immediately apparent from regularity's symmetric realization in shape space. However, Prob(Obtuse and Flat), Prob(Obtuse is Flat) and all other nontrivial expressions concerning having any two of the properties mentioned above, or having one of these conditioned on another, constitute nontrivial variants of the pillow problem, and we solve them all.",0
132658,1,"Quantum Enhanced Classical Sensor Networks The quantum enhanced classical sensor network consists of $K$ clusters of $N_e$ entangled quantum states that have been trialled $r$ times, each feeding into a classical estimation process. Previous literature has shown that each cluster can {ideally} achieve an estimation variance of $1/N_e^2r$ for sufficient $r$. We begin by deriving the optimal values for the minimum mean squared error of this quantum enhanced classical system. We then show that if noise is \emph{absent} in the classical estimation process, the mean estimation error will decay like $\Omega(1/KN_e^2r)$. However, when noise is \emph{present} we find that the mean estimation error will decay like $\Omega(1/K)$, so that \emph{all} the sensing gains obtained from the individual quantum clusters will be lost.",0
133020,1,"A normalization approach for scattering modes to be of use in classical and quantum electrodynamics We propose a scheme to normalize scattering modes of the electromagnetic field. By relying on analytical solutions for Maxwell's equations in the homogeneous medium outside the scatterer, we derive normalization conditions that only depend on the electromagnetic field on the surface of a sphere containing the scatterer. We pay special attention to the important cases of plane-wave illumination and illumination with a multipolar field, for which an explicit and easy-to-use normalization condition is derived. Our approach to normalize scattering modes is extremely versatile and of diverse use. We demonstrate the applicability by normalizing scattering modes of selected metallic and dielectric scatterers of different geometries in the context of different operation scenarios. Since every quantum mechanical treatment of light-matter interaction requires the proper normalization of electromagnetic fields, we deem our proposed normalization scheme beneficial because it provides normalized modes in arbitrary scattering scenarios.",0
133055,1,"Entropic functionals of Laguerre and Gegenbauer polynomials with large parameters The determination of the physical entropies (R\'enyi, Shannon, Tsallis) of high-dimensional quantum systems subject to a central potential requires the knowledge of the asymptotics of some power and logarithmic integral functionals of the hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials which control the wavefunctions of the stationary states. For the $D$-dimensional hydrogenic and oscillator-like systems, the wavefunctions of the corresponding bound states are controlled by the Laguerre ($\mathcal{L}_{m}^{(\alpha)}(x)$) and Gegenbauer ($\mathcal{C}^{(\alpha)}_{m}(x)$) polynomials in both position and momentum spaces, where the parameter $\alpha$ linearly depends on $D$. In this work we study the asymptotic behavior as $\alpha \to \infty$ of the associated entropy-like integral functionals of these two families of hypergeometric polynomials.",0

133137,1,"Chasing Individuation: Mathematical Description of Physical Systems This work is a conceptual analysis of certain recent developments in the mathematical foundations of Classical and Quantum Mechanics which have allowed to formulate both theories in a common language. From the algebraic point of view, the set of observables of a physical system, be it classical or quantum, is described by a \emph{Jordan-Lie algebra}. From the geometric point of view, the space of states of any system is described by a \emph{uniform Poisson space with transition probability}. Both these structures are here perceived as formal translations of \emph{the fundamental twofold role of properties in Mechanics}: they are at the same time quantities and transformations. The question becomes then to understand the precise articulation between these two roles. The analysis will show that Quantum Mechanics can be thought as distinguishing itself from Classical Mechanics by a compatibility condition between properties-as-quantities and properties-as-transformations. Moreover, this dissertation shows the existence of a tension between a certain ""abstract way"" of conceiving mathematical structures, used in the practice of mathematical physics, and the necessary capacity to specify particular states or observables. It then becomes important to understand how, within the formalism, one can construct a \emph{labelling scheme}. The ""Chase for Individuation"" is the analysis of different mathematical techniques which attempt to overcome this tension. In particular, we discuss how group theory furnishes a partial solution.",0
133306,1,"Fast initial guess estimation for digital image correlation Digital image correlation (DIC) is a widely used optical metrology for quantitative deformation measurement due to its non-contact, low-cost, highly precise feature. DIC relies on nonlinear optimization algorithm. Thus it is quite important to efficiently obtain a reliable initial guess. The most widely used method for obtaining initial guess is reliability-guided digital image correlation (RG-DIC) method, which is reliable but path-dependent. This path-dependent method limits the further improvement of computation speed of DIC using parallel computing technology, and error of calculation may be spread out along the calculation path. Therefore, a reliable and path-independent algorithm which is able to provide reliable initial guess is desirable to reach full potential of the ability of parallel computing. In this paper, an algorithm used for initial guess estimation is proposed. Numerical and real experiments show that the proposed algorithm, adaptive incremental dissimilarity approximations algorithm (A-IDA), has the following characteristics: 1) Compared with inverse compositional Gauss-Newton (IC-GN) sub-pixel registration algorithm, the computational time required by A-IDA algorithm is negligible, especially when subset size is relatively large; 2) the efficiency of A-IDA algorithm is less influenced by search range; 3) the efficiency is less influenced by subset size; 4) it is easy to select the threshold for the proposed algorithm.",0
133331,1,"The physical driver of the optical Eigenvector 1 in Quasar Main Sequence Quasars are complex sources, characterized by broad band spectra from radio through optical to X-ray band, with numerous emission and absorption features. However, Boroson & Green (1992) used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and with this analysis they were able to show significant correlations between the measured parameters. The leading component, related to Eigenvector 1 (EV1) was dominated by the anticorrelation between the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ optical emission and [OIII] line and EV1 alone contained 30% of the total variance. It opened a way in defining a quasar main sequence, in close analogy to the stellar main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram (Sulentic et al. 2001). The question still remains which of the basic theoretically motivated parameters of an active nucleus (Eddington ratio, black hole mass, accretion rate, spin, and viewing angle) is the main driver behind the EV1. Here we limit ourselves to the optical waveband, and concentrate on theoretical modelling the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ to H$\mathrm{\beta}$ ratio, and we test the hypothesis that the physical driver of EV1 is the maximum of the accretion disk temperature, reflected in the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED). We performed computations of the H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and optical Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ for a broad range of SED peak position using CLOUDY photoionisation code. We assumed that both H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ emission come from the Broad Line Region represented as a constant density cloud in a plane-parallel geometry. We expected that a hotter disk continuum will lead to more efficient production of Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ but our computations show that the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ to H$\mathrm{\beta}$ ratio actually drops with the rise of the disk temperature. Thus either hypothesis is incorrect, or approximations used in our paper for the description of the line emissivity is inadequate.",0
133416,1,"Fifty years of the finite nonperiodic Toda lattice: A geometric and topological viewpoint In 1967, Japanese physicist Morikazu Toda published a pair of seminal papers in the Journal of the Physical Society of Japan that exhibited soliton solutions to a chain of particles with nonlinear interactions between nearest neighbors. In the fifty years that followed, Toda's system of particles has been generalized in different directions, each with its own analytic, geometric, and topological characteristics. These are known collectively as the Toda lattice. This survey recounts and compares the various versions of the finite nonperiodic Toda lattice from the perspective of their geometry and topology. In particular, we highlight the polytope structure of the solution spaces as viewed through the moment map, and we explain the connection between the real indefinite Toda flows and the integral cohomology of real flag varieties.",0

133471,1,"Muon dynamic radiography of density changes induced by hydrothermal activity at the La Soufri\`ere of Guadeloupe volcano Imaging geological structures through cosmic muon radiography is a newly developed technique particularly interesting in volcanology. Here we show that muon radiography may be efficient to detect and characterize mass movements in shallow hydrothermal systems of low-energy active volcanoes like the La Soufri\`ere lava dome. We present an experiment conducted on this volcano during the Summer $2014$ and bring evidence that huge density changes occurred in three domains of the lava dome. Depending on their position and on the medium porosity the volumes of these domains vary from $1 \times 10^6 \; \mathrm{m}^3$ to $7 \times 10^6 \; \mathrm{m}^3$. However, the mass changes remain quite constant, two of them being negative ($\Delta m \approx -0.6 \times 10^9 \; \mathrm{kg}$) and a third one being positive ($\Delta m \approx +2 \times 10^9 \; \mathrm{kg}$). We attribute the negative mass changes to the formation of steam in shallow hydrothermal reservoir previously partly filled with liquid water. This coincides with the apparition of new fumaroles on top of the volcano. The positive mass change is synchronized with the negative mass changes indicating that liquid water probably flowed from the two reservoirs invaded by steam toward the third reservoir.",0
133672,1,"Trigger of the Ubiquitous Surface Band Bending in 3D Topological Insulators The main scientific activity in the field of topological insulators (TIs) consists of determining their electronic structure by means of magnetotransport and electron spectroscopy with a view to devices based on topological transport. There is, however, a caveat in this approach. There are systematic experimental discrepancies on the electronic structure of the most pristine surfaces of TI single crystals as determined by Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations and by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). We identify intense ultraviolet illumination—that is inherent to an ARPES experiment—as the source for these experimental differences. We explicitly show that illumination is the key parameter, or in other words, the trigger, for energetic shifts of electronic bands near the surface of a TI crystal. This finding revisits the common belief that surface decoration is the principal cause of surface band bending and explains why band bending is not a prime issue in illumination-free magnetotransport studies. Our study further clarifies the role of illumination on the electronic band structure of TIs by revealing its dual effect: downward band bending on very small time scales followed by band flattening at large time scales. Our results therefore allow us to present and predict the complete evolution of the band structure of TIs in a typical ARPES experiment. By virtue of our findings, we pinpoint two alternatives of how to approach flat-band conditions by means of photon-based techniques and we suggest a microscopic mechanism that can explain the underlying phenomena.",0
133767,1,"Dynamic Chiral Magnetic Effect and Faraday Rotation in Macroscopically Disordered Helical Metals We develop an effective medium theory for electromagnetic wave propagation through gapless nonuniform systems with a dynamic chiral magnetic effect. The theory allows us to calculate macroscopic-disorder-induced corrections to the values of optical, as well as chiral magnetic conductivities. In particular, we show that spatial fluctuations of the optical conductivity induce corrections to the effective value of the chiral magnetic conductivity. The absolute value of the effect varies strongly depending on the system parameters, but yields the leading frequency dependence of the polarization rotation and circular dichroism signals. Experimentally, these corrections can be observed as features in the Faraday rotation angle near frequencies that correspond to the bulk plasmon resonances of a material. Such features are not expected to be present in single-crystal samples.",0

134115,1,"Cyclic tridiagonal pairs, higher order Onsager algebras and orthogonal polynomials The concept of cyclic tridiagonal pairs is introduced, and explicit examples are given. For a fairly general class of cyclic tridiagonal pairs with cyclicity N, we associate a pair of `divided polynomials'. The properties of this pair generalize the ones of tridiagonal pairs of Racah type. The algebra generated by the pair of divided polynomials is identified as a higher-order generalization of the Onsager algebra. It can be viewed as a subalgebra of the q-Onsager algebra for a proper specialization at q the primitive 2Nth root of unity. Orthogonal polynomials beyond the Leonard duality are revisited in light of this framework. In particular, certain second-order Dunkl shift operators provide a realization of the divided polynomials at N=2 or q=i.",0
134539,1,"An Ocean Drum: quasi-geostrophic energetics from a Riemann geometry perspective We revisit the discussion of the energetics of quasi-geostrophic flows from a geometric perspective based on the introduction of an effective metric, built in terms of the flow stratification and the Coriolis parameter. In particular, an appropriate notion of normal modes is defined through a spectral geometry problem in the ocean basin (a compact manifold with boundary) for the associated Laplace-Beltrami scalar operator. This spectral problem can be used to systematically encode non-local aspects of stratification and topography. As examples of applications we revisit the isotropy assumption in geostrophic turbulence, identify (a patch of) the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$ as the leading-order term in the effective geometry for the deep mesoscale ocean and, finally, discuss some diagnostic tools based on a simple statistical mechanics toy-model to be used in numerical simulations and/or observations of quasi-geostrophic flows.",0
134551,1,Pulse rate estimation using imaging photoplethysmography: generic framework and comparison of methods on a publicly available dataset Objective: to establish an algorithmic framework and a benchmark dataset for comparing methods of pulse rate estimation using imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG).

Then we investigate performance of these methods for DEAP dataset www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/ containing facial videos and reference contact photoplethysmograms. Main results: best assessment precision is achieved when pulse rate is estimated using continuous wavelet transform from iPPG extracted by the POS method (overall mean absolute error below 2 heart beats per minute). Significance: we provide a generic framework for theoretical comparison of methods for pulse rate estimation from iPPG and report results for the most popular methods on a publicly available dataset that can be used as a benchmark.,0

However, in the literature, there is no formula completely revealing this relation. In this paper, using permutations and compositions, we establish two explicit formulas for the Euler sums, and show that all the Euler sums are indeed expressible in terms of MZVs. Moreover, we apply this method to the alternating Euler sums, and show that all the alternating Euler sums are reducible to alternating MZVs. Some special cases, such as the explicit expressions of $S_{r^m,q}$, $S_{\bar{r}^m,q}$, $S_{r^m,\bar{q}}$ and $S_{\bar{r}^m,\bar{q}}$, are also presented here.",0

We find that the new method has good noise resilience and enhanced contrast especially for weak intensity features and meanwhile preserves the quantitative local maxima information from the raw image.

Such a precision is not degraded in the sub-wavelength regime, thus overcoming the traditional limitations of classical direct imaging derived from Rayleigh's criterion.

134713,1,"An Equal Space for Complex Data with Unknown Internal Order: Observability, Gauge Invariance and Manifold Learning We discuss the interplay between manifold-learning techniques, which can extract intrinsic order from observations of complex dynamics, and systems modeling considerations. Tuning the scale of the data-mining kernels can guide the construction of dynamic models at different levels of coarse-graining. In particular, we focus on the observability of physical space from temporal observation data and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based) representations, embedded in what we call an ""Equal Space"". Data-driven coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data mining can then go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems. These techniques can enhance the scope and applicability of established tools in the analysis of dynamical systems, such as the Takens delay embedding. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks.",0

Here we also investigate the VLT/X-SHOOTER spectrum of CR7 whose 6 sigma detection of He II is claimed by Sobral et al. Although two individuals and the ESO-archive service carefully re-analyze the X-SHOOTER data that are used in the study of Sobral et al., no He II signal of CR7 is detected, supportive of weak UV-nebular lines of the bright LAEs even for CR7. Spectral properties of these bright LAEs are thus clearly different from those of faint dropouts at z~7 that have strong UV-nebular lines shown in the various studies. Comparing these bright LAEs and the faint dropouts, we find anti-correlations between the UV-nebular line EW_0 and UV-continuum luminosity, which are similar to those found at z~2-3.",0
135064,1,"Cavity-induced artificial gauge field in a Bose-Hubbard ladder We consider theoretically ultracold interacting bosonic atoms confined to quasi-one-dimensional ladder structures formed by optical lattices and coupled to the field of an optical cavity. The atoms can collect a spatial phase imprint during a cavity-assisted tunneling along a rung via Raman transitions employing a cavity mode and a transverse running wave pump beam. By adiabatic elimination of the cavity field we obtain an effective Hamiltonian for the bosonic atoms, with a self-consistency condition. Using the numerical density-matrix renormalization-group method, we obtain a rich steady-state diagram of self-organized steady states. Transitions between superfluid to Mott-insulating states occur, on top of which we can have Meissner, vortex liquid, and vortex lattice phases. Also a state that explicitly breaks the symmetry between the two legs of the ladder, namely, the biased-ladder phase, is dynamically stabilized. We investigate the influence that a trapping potential has on the stability of the self-organized phases.",0
