15,2,"Antiproton-nucleus quasi-bound states within the 2009 version of the Paris $\bar{N}N$ potential We studied the ${\bar p}$ interactions with the nuclear medium within the 2009 version of the Paris ${\bar N}N$ potential model. We constructed the $\bar{p}$--nucleus optical potential using the Paris $S$- and $P$-wave ${\bar p}N$ scattering amplitudes and treated their strong energy and density dependence self-consistently. We considered a phenomenological $P$-wave term as well. We calculated $\bar{p}$ binding energies and widths of the $\bar{p}$ bound in various nuclei. The $P$-wave potential has very small effect on the calculated ${\bar p}$ binding energies, however, it reduces the corresponding widths noticeably. Moreover, the $S$-wave potential based on the Paris amplitudes supplemented by a phenomenological $P$-wave term yields the ${\bar p}$ binding energies and widths in very good agreement with those obtained within the RMF model consistent with ${\bar p}$-atom data.",1
20,2,"Integrability and duality in spin chains We construct a new, two-parametric family of integrable models and reveal their underlying duality symmetry. A modular subgroup of this duality is shown to connect non-interacting modes of different systems. We apply the new solution and duality to a Richardson-Gaudin model and generate a novel integrable system termed the $s$-$d$ wave Richardson-Gaudin-Kitaev interacting chain, interpolating $s$- and $d$- wave superconductivity. The phase diagram of this model has a topological phase transition that can be connected to the duality, where the occupancy of the non-interacting mode serves as a topological order parameter.",1
66,2,"Fast and accurate inference on gravitational waves from precessing compact binaries Inferring astrophysical information from gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries is one of the key science goals of gravitational-wave astronomy. In order to reach the full scientific potential of gravitational-wave experiments, we require techniques to mitigate the cost of Bayesian inference, especially as gravitational-wave signal models and analyses become increasingly sophisticated and detailed. Reduced-order models (ROMs) of gravitational waveforms can significantly reduce the computational cost of inference by removing redundant computations. In this paper, we construct the first reduced-order models of gravitational-wave signals that include the effects of spin precession, inspiral, merger, and ringdown in compact object binaries and that are valid for component masses describing binary neutron star, binary black hole, and mixed binary systems. This work utilizes the waveform model known as “IMRPhenomPv2.” Our ROM enables the use of a fast reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) integration rule which allows us to approximate Bayesian probability density functions at a greatly reduced computational cost. We find that the ROQ rule can be used to speed-up inference by factors as high as 300 without introducing systematic bias. This corresponds to a reduction in computational time from around half a year to half a day for the longest duration and lowest mass signals. The ROM and ROQ rules are available with the main inference library of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, LALInference.",1
81,2,"Uncertainty principle on 3-dimensional manifolds of constant curvature We consider the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of position and momentum in 3-dimensional spaces of constant curvature $K$. The uncertainty of position is defined coordinate independent by the geodesic radius of spherical domains in which the particle is localized after a von Neumann-L\""uders projection. By applying mathematical standard results from spectral analysis on manifolds, we obtain the largest lower bound of the momentum deviation in terms of the geodesic radius and $K$. For hyperbolic spaces, we also obtain a global lower bound $\sigma_p\geq |K|^\frac{1}{2}\hbar$, which is non-zero and independent of the uncertainty in position. Finally, the lower bound for the Schwarzschild radius of a static black hole is derived and given by $r_s\geq 2\,l_P$, where $l_P$ is the Planck length.",1
109,2,"Dynamical screening of α-α resonant scattering and thermal nuclear scattering rate in a plasma We use effective field theory and thermal field theory to study the dynamical screening effect in the QED plasma on the α-α scattering at the Be8 resonance. Dynamical screening leads to an imaginary part of the potential which results in a thermal width for the resonance and dominates over the previously considered static screening effect. As a result, both the resonance energy and width increase with the plasma temperature. Furthermore, dynamical screening can have a huge impact on the α-α thermal nuclear scattering rate. For example, when the temperature is around 10 keV, the rate is suppressed by a factor of about 900. We expect similar thermal suppressions of nuclear reaction rates to occur in those reactions dominated by an above threshold resonance with a thermal energy. Dynamical screening effects on nuclear reactions can be relevant to cosmology and astrophysics.",1
268,2,"$\mathcal{PT}$ -symmetric rational Calogero model with balanced loss and gain A two-body rational Calogero model with balanced loss and gain is investigated. The system yields a Hamiltonian which is symmetric under the combined operation of parity ( $\mathcal{P}$ ) and time reversal ( $\mathcal{T}$ ) symmetry. It is shown that the system is integrable and exact, stable classical solutions are obtained for particular ranges of the parameters. The corresponding quantum system admits bound state solutions for the exactly same ranges of the parameters for which the classical solutions are stable. The eigenspectrum of the system is presented with a discussion on the normalization of the wave functions in proper Stokes wedges. Finally, the Calogero model with balanced loss and gain is studied classically, when the pair-wise harmonic interaction term is replaced by a common confining harmonic potential. The system admits stable solutions for particular ranges of the parameters. However, the integrability and/or exact solvability of the system is obscure due to the presence of the loss and gain terms. The perturbative solutions are obtained and are compared with the numerical results.",1
319,2,"Action-angle variables for geodesic motions in Sasaki-Einstein spaces $Y^{p,q}$ We use action-angle variables to describe the geodesic motions in the 5-dimensional Sasaki–Einstein spaces Yp,q. This formulation allows us to study thoroughly the complete integrability of the system. We find that the Hamiltonian involves a reduced number of action variables. Therefore one of the fundamental frequencies is zero, indicating chaotic behavior when the system is perturbed.",1

For most of these processes we provide predictions for the total cross sections and in the case of the (anti)neutrino-$^3$He and (anti)neutrino-$^3$H inelastic scattering we compute examples of essential response functions, using the AV18 nucleon-nucleon potential and a single-nucleon weak current operator. For the reactions with the deuteron we study relativistic effects in the final state kinematics and compare two-nucleon scattering states obtained in momentum and coordinate spaces. Our results from momentum space are compared with the theoretical predictions by G.Shen et al., Phys. Rev. C 86, 035503 (2012). The observed disagreement can be attributed to the differences in kinematics and in the weak current operator.",1
359,2,"On the end stage of spherical gravitational collapse in a cosmological scenario We consider the end stage of spherical gravitational collapse in a cosmological setting. As an alternative to standard spherical top-hat collapse, an expanding FLRW metric is matched to a generic contracting solution of Einstein's equations on a space-like hypersurface. Using the Israel junction conditions, this is done at a time when the scale factor of expansion reaches its maximum value. In this scenario, we first show that inhomogeneous dust collapse of the LTB type are ruled out by virtue of the junction conditions. We then investigate non-dust like collapse with vanishing radial pressure, and show that this can lead to a known regular interior Schwarzschild solution, without ad hoc virialization. The other possibilities at equilibrium invariably lead to naked singularities, and we obtain a new class of such naked singularities. Finally, we consider a simplistic analytic model for collapse, and show via the matching process that it can lead to the formation of singularity-free space-times as the end stage, while respecting the known cosmological parameters. The presence of trapped surfaces in this example do not lead to singularities, due to a violation of the strong energy condition.",1
367,2,"Recent developments in the tidal deformability of spinning compact objects We review recent work on the theory of tidal deformability and the tidal Love numbers of a slowly spinning compact object within general relativity. Angular momentum introduces couplings between distortions of different parity and new classes of spin-induced, tidal Love numbers emerge. Due to spin-tidal effects, a rotating object immersed in a quadrupolar, electric tidal field can acquire some induced mass, spin, quadrupole, octupole and hexadecapole moments to second-order in the spin. The tidal Love numbers depend strongly on the object’s internal structure. All tidal Love numbers of a Kerr black hole (BH) were proved to be exactly zero to first-order in the spin and also to second-order in the spin, at least in the axisymmetric case. For a binary system close to the merger, various components of the tidal field become relevant. Preliminary results suggest that spin-tidal couplings can introduce important corrections to the gravitational waveforms of spinning neutron star (NS) binaries approaching the merger.",1
375,2,"Determination of the $\boldsymbol{\eta ^3{\rm He}}$ threshold structure from the low energy $\boldsymbol{pd \to \eta ^3{\rm He}}$ reaction We analyze the data on cross sections and asymmetries for the pd→ηHe3 reaction close to threshold and look for bound states of the ηHe3 system. Rather than parameterizing the scattering matrix, as is usually done, we develop a framework in which the η3He optical potential is the key ingredient, and its strength, together with some production parameters, are fitted to the available experimental data. The relationship of the scattering matrix to the optical potential is established using the Bethe-Salpeter equation and the ηHe3 loop function incorporates the range of the interaction given by the empirical He3 density. We find a local Breit-Wigner form of the ηHe3 amplitude T below threshold with a clear peak in |T|2, which corresponds to an ηHe3 binding of about 0.3 MeV and a width of about 3 MeV. By fitting the potential we can also evaluate the ηHe3 scattering length, including its sign, thus resolving the ambiguity in the former analyses.",1
380,2,"Stellar structure and compact objects before 1940: Towards relativistic astrophysics Since the mid-1920s, different strands of research used stars as “physics laboratories” for investigating the nature of matter under extreme densities and pressures, impossible to realize on Earth. To trace this process this paper is following the evolution of the concept of a dense core in stars, which was important both for an understanding of stellar evolution and as a testing ground for the fast-evolving field of nuclear physics. In spite of the divide between physicists and astrophysicists, some key actors working in the cross-fertilized soil of overlapping but different scientific cultures formulated models and tentative theories that gradually evolved into more realistic and structured astrophysical objects. These investigations culminated in the first contact with general relativity in 1939, when J. Robert Oppenheimer and his students George Volkoff and Hartland Snyder systematically applied the theory to the dense core of a collapsing neutron star. This pioneering application of Einstein’s theory to an astrophysical compact object can be regarded as a milestone in the path eventually leading to the emergence of relativistic astrophysics in the early 1960s.",1
387,2,"Anisotropic cosmological solutions in $R + R^2$ gravity In this paper we investigate the past evolution of an anisotropic Bianchi I universe in $R+R^2$ gravity. Using the dynamical system approach we show that there exists a new two-parameter set of solutions that includes both an isotropic “false radiation” solution and an anisotropic generalized Kasner solution, which is stable. We derive the analytic behavior of the shear from a specific property of f(R) gravity and the analytic asymptotic form of the Ricci scalar when approaching the initial singularity. Finally, we numerically check our results.",1
475,2,"New relativistic effective interaction for finite nuclei, infinite nuclear matter and neutron stars We carry out the study of finite nuclei, infinite nuclear matter, and neutron star properties with the newly developed relativistic force, the Institute of Physics Bhubaneswar-I (IOPB-I). Using this force, we calculate the binding energies, charge radii, and neutron-skin thickness for some selected nuclei. From the ground-state properties of superheavy nuclei (Z=120), it is noticed that considerable shell gaps appear at neutron numbers N=172, 184, and 198, manifesting the magicity at these numbers. The low-density behavior of the equation of state for pure neutron matter is compatible with other microscopic models. Along with the nuclear symmetry energy, its slope and curvature parameters at the saturation density are consistent with those extracted from various experimental data. We calculate the neutron star properties with the equation of state composed of nucleons and leptons in β-equilibrium, which are in good agreement with the x-ray observations by Steiner [Astrophys. J. 722, 33 (2010)10.1088/0004-637X/722/1/33] and Nättilä [Astron. Astrophys. 591, A25 (2016)10.1051/0004-6361/201527416]. Based on the recent observation of GW170817 with a quasi-universal relation, Rezzolla et al. [Astrophys. J. Lett. 852, L25 (2018)10.3847/2041-8213/aaa401] have set a limit for the maximum mass that can be supported against gravity by a nonrotating neutron star in the range 2.01±0.04≲M(M⊙)≲2.16±0.03. We find that the maximum mass of the neutron star for the IOPB-I parametrization is 2.15M⊙. The radius and tidal deformability of a canonical neutron star of mass 1.4M⊙ are 13.2 km and 3.9×1036gcm2s2, respectively.",1

683,2,"The decay of the $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields on the Schwarzschild black hole for spherically symmetric small energy initial data We prove uniform decay estimates in the entire exterior of the Schwarzschild black hole for gauge invariant norms on the Yang–Mills fields valued in the Lie algebra associated to the Lie group SU(2) . We assume that the initial data are spherically symmetric satisfying a certain Ansatz, and have small energy, which eliminates the stationary solutions which do not decay. In particular, there do not exist any Coulomb type solutions satisfying this Ansatz. We first prove a Morawetz type estimate for the Yang–Mills fields within this setting, using the Yang–Mills equations directly. We then adapt the proof constructed in previous work by the first author to show local energy decay and uniform decay of the L∞ norm of the middle components in the entire exterior of the Schwarzschild black hole, including the event horizon.",1
723,2,"A beyond-mean-field model for Λ hypernuclei with Skyrme-type NΛ interaction A beyond-mean-field approach based on the Skyrme–Hartree–Fock model is derived and implemented for $^{13}_{\ \,\Lambda}C$ and $^{21}_{\ \Lambda}Ne$. The Skyrme force with the SLy4 parameter set is used for NN interaction, and a recently updated Skyrme-type parameter set, SLL4, is employed for $N\Lambda$ interaction. The hyperonic spin–orbit force is also included to reproduce the spin–orbit splitting of single-particle energy levels and the no-crossing rule. Properties of different configurations, such as $^{12}C\otimes\Lambda[000]1/2^+$, $^{12}C\otimes\Lambda[110]1/2^-$, $^{12}C\otimes\Lambda[101]3/2^-$, and $^{12}C\otimes\Lambda[101]1/2^-$ are discussed. Low-lying energy spectra of $^{13}_{\ \,\Lambda}C$, including both positive- and negative-parity levels, are presented and compared to the observed data. It is shown that this current model precisely reproduces the observed positive-parity energy level with the configuration [$^{12}C_{\textrm{g.s.}}(2^+)\otimes s_\Lambda$]. The two observed negative-parity levels, [$^{12}C_{\textrm{g.s.}}(0^+)\otimes(p_{1/2})_\Lambda$] and [$^{12}C_{\textrm{g.s.}}(0^+)\otimes(p_{3/2})_\Lambda$], are also successfully reproduced but with reversed order. Energy spectra of $^{21}_{\ \Lambda}Ne$ are also presented and compared to the results of a beyond relativistic mean-field model; except for some details, the two models give similar results.",1
741,2,"Varying fundamental constants: a full covariant approach and cosmological applications We build a minimal extension of General Relativity in which Newton's gravitational coupling, $G$, the speed of light, $c$, and the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, are spacetime variables. This is done while satisfying the contracted Bianchi identity as well as the local conservation of energy momentum tensor. A dynamical constraint is derived, which shows that variations of $G$ and $c$ are coupled to the local matter-energy physical content, while variation of $\Lambda$ is coupled to the local geometry. This constraint presents a natural cosmological screening mechanism that brings new perspective concerning the current observations of a cosmological constant, $\Lambda_0$ in cosmological observations. We also explore early universe background cosmology and show that the proposal provides alternatives to obtain an accelerated expansion, similar to those coming from Varying Speed of Light theories.",1
778,2,"Beyond ideal magnetohydrodynamics: from fibration to 3  +  1 foliation We consider a resistive multi-fluid framework from the 3  +  1 space-time foliation point-of-view, paying particular attention to issues relating to the use of multi-parameter equations of state and the associated inversion from evolved to primitive variables. We highlight relevant numerical issues that arise for general systems with relative flows. As an application of the new formulation, we consider a three-component system relevant for hot neutron stars. In this case we let the baryons (neutrons and protons) move together, but allow heat and electrons to exhibit relative flow. This reduces the problem to three momentum equations, overall energy-momentum conservation, a generalised Ohm’s law and a heat equation. Our results provide a hierarchy of increasingly complex models and prepare the ground for new state-of-the-art simulations of relevant scenarios in relativistic astrophysics.",1
781,2,"Cosmological Tests of Everpresent $\Lambda$ Everpresent $\Lambda$ is a cosmological scenario in which the observed cosmological ""constant"" $\Lambda$ fluctuates between positive and negative values with a vanishing mean, and with a magnitude comparable to the critical density at any epoch. In accord with a longstanding heuristic prediction of causal set theory, it postulates that $\Lambda$ is a stochastic function of cosmic time that will vary from one realization of the scenario to another. Herein, we consider two models of ""dark energy"" that exhibit these features. Via Monte Carlo Markov chains, we explore the space of cosmological parameters and the set of stochastic realizations of these models, finding that Everpresent $\Lambda$ can fit the current cosmological observations as well as the $\Lambda$CDM model does. Furthermore, it removes observational tensions with $\Lambda$CDM, for low redshift measurements of Hubble constant, and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at $z\sim 2-3$. However, we also find that Everpresent $\Lambda$ does not significantly help with the growth of ultramassive black holes at high redshift, and the Lithium problem in Big Bang Nuclesynthesis. Future measurements of ""dark energy"" at high redshifts will further test the viability of Everpresent $\Lambda$ as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.",1
830,2,"The energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetic fields in matter We present a complete resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski controversy . This is done by considering several new aspects which invalidate previous discussions. We show that: 1)For polarized matter the center of mass theorem is no longer valid in its usual form. A contribution related to microscopic spin should be considered. 2)The electromagnetic dipolar energy density contributes to the inertia of matter and should be incorporated covariantly to the the energy-momentum tensor of matter. Then there is an electromagnetic component in matter's momentum density whose variation explains the results of the only experiment which supports Abraham's force. 3)Averaging the microscopic Lorentz's force results in the unambiguos expression for the force density exerted by the field. This force density is consistent with all the experimental evidence. 4)Momentum conservation determines the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor. This tensor is different from Abraham's and Minkowski's tensors, but one recovers Minkowski's expression for the momentum density. The energy density is different from Poynting's expression but Poynting's vector remains the same. Our tensor is non-symmetric which allows the field to exert a distributed torque on matter. We use our results to discuss momentum and angular momentum exchange in various situations of physical interest. We find complete consistency of our equations in the description of the systems considered. We also show that several alternative expressions of the field energy-momentum tensor and force-density cannot be successfully used in all our examples. In particular we verify in two of these examples that the center of mass and spin introduced by us moves with constant velocity, but that the standard center of mass does not.",1

916,2,"Forward modelling of quasar light curves and the cosmological matter power spectrum on milliparsec scales We devise an optimal method to measure the temporal power spectrum of the lensing and intrinsic fluctuations of multiply-imaged strongly lensed quasar light curves, along with the associated time delays. The method is based on a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling of a putative gaussian likelihood, and accurately recovers the input properties of simulated light curves, as well as the ""Time Delay Challenge"". We apply this method to constrain the dimensionless cosmological (non-linear) matter power spectrum on milliparsec scales (comparable to the size of the solar system), to $\Delta_{\rm NL}^4< 1 \times 10^7$ at $k_{\rm NL} \sim 10^3 {\rm pc}^{-1}$. Using a semi-analytic nonlinear clustering model which is calibrated to simulations, the corresponding constraint on the primordial (linear) scalar power spectrum is ${\cal P}_{\cal R} < 3 \times 10^{-9}$ at $k_{\rm L}\sim$ 3 pc$^{-1}$. This is the strongest constraint on primordial power spectrum at these scales, and is within an order of magnitude from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction. We also report measurements of temporal spectra for intrinsic variabilities of quasar light curves, which can be used to constrain the size of the emitting region in accretion disks. Future cadenced optical imaging surveys, such as LSST, should increase the number of observed strongly lensed quasars by 3 orders of magnitude and significantly improve these measurements, even though improvements in modelling quasar accretion and stellar microlensing are necessary.",1
917,2,"In-Orbit Instrument Performance Study and Calibration for POLAR Polarization Measurements POLAR is a compact space-borne detector designed to perform reliable measurements of the polarization for transient sources like Gamma-Ray Bursts in the energy range 50–500 keV. The instrument works based on the Compton Scattering principle with the plastic scintillators as the main detection material along with the multi-anode photomultiplier tube. POLAR has been launched successfully onboard the Chinese space laboratory TG-2 on 15th September, 2016. In order to reliably reconstruct the polarization information a highly detailed understanding of the instrument is required for both data analysis and Monte Carlo studies. For this purpose a full study of the in-orbit performance was performed in order to obtain the instrument calibration parameters such as noise, pedestal, gain nonlinearity of the electronics, threshold, crosstalk and gain, as well as the effect of temperature on the above parameters. Furthermore the relationship between gain and high voltage of the multi-anode photomultiplier tube has been studied and the errors on all measurement values are presented. Finally the typical systematic error on polarization measurements of Gamma-Ray Bursts due to the measurement error of the calibration parameters are estimated using Monte Carlo simulations.",1
955,2,"Covariant electrodynamics in linear media: Optical metric While the postulate of covariance of Maxwell’s equations for all inertial observers led Einstein to special relativity, it was the further demand of general covariance—form invariance under general coordinate transformations, including between accelerating frames—that led to general relativity. Several lines of inquiry over the past two decades, notably the development of metamaterial-based transformation optics, has spurred a greater interest in the role of geometry and space-time covariance for electrodynamics in ponderable media. I develop a generally covariant, coordinate-free framework for electrodynamics in general dielectric media residing in curved background space-times. In particular, I derive a relation for the spatial medium parameters measured by an arbitrary timelike observer. In terms of those medium parameters I derive an explicit expression for the pseudo-Finslerian optical metric of birefringent media and show how it reduces to a pseudo-Riemannian optical metric for nonbirefringent media. This formulation provides a basis for a unified approach to ray and congruence tracing through media in curved space-times that may smoothly vary among positively refracting, negatively refracting, and vacuum.",1

We discuss the general solutions of accretion using the isothermal and polytropic equations of state for steady state, spherically symmetric, non-rotating accretion on the black hole. In the case of isothermal flow, we consider some specific fluids and derive their solutions at the sonic point as well. However, in the case of polytropic fluid we calculate the general expressions only, as there exists no global (Bondi) solutions for polytropic test fluids. In addition to this, the effect of fluid on the mass accretion rate are also studied. Moreover, the large monopole parameter β greatly suppresses the maximum accretion rate.",1

1274,2,"Separating metric perturbations in near-horizon extremal Kerr Linear perturbation theory is a powerful toolkit for studying black hole spacetimes. However, the perturbation equations are hard to solve unless we can use separation of variables. In the Kerr spacetime, metric perturbations do not separate, but curvature perturbations do. The cost of curvature perturbations is a very complicated metric-reconstruction procedure. This procedure can be avoided using a symmetry-adapted choice of basis functions in highly symmetric spacetimes, such as near-horizon extremal Kerr. In this paper, we focus on this spacetime and (i) construct the symmetry-adapted basis functions; (ii) show their orthogonality; and (iii) show that they lead to separation of variables of the scalar, Maxwell, and metric perturbation equations. This separation turns the system of partial differential equations into one of ordinary differential equations over a compact domain, the polar angle.",1
1282,2,"Testing (modified) gravity with 3D and tomographic cosmic shear Cosmic shear, the weak gravitational lensing caused by the large-scale structure, is one of the primary probes to test gravity with current and future surveys. There are two main techniques to analyse a cosmic shear survey; a tomographic method, where correlations between the lensing signal in different redshift bins are used to recover redshift information, and a 3D approach, where the full redshift information is carried through the entire analysis. Here we compare the two methods, by forecasting cosmological constraints for future surveys like Euclid. We extend the 3D formalism for the first time to theories beyond the standard model, belonging to the Horndeski class. This includes the majority of universally coupled extensions to {\Lambda}CDM with one scalar degree of freedom in addition to the metric, which are still in agreement with current observations. Given a fixed background, the evolution of linear perturbations in Horndeski gravity is described by a set of four functions of time only. We model their time evolution assuming proportionality to the dark energy density fraction and place Fisher matrix constraints on the proportionality coefficients. We find that a 3D analysis can constrain Horndeski theories better than a tomographic one, in particular with a decrease in the errors on the Horndeski parameters of the order of 20 - 30$\%$. This paper shows for the first time a quantitative comparison on an equal footing between Fisher matrix forecasts for both a fully 3D and a tomographic analysis of cosmic shear surveys. The increased sensitivity of the 3D formalism comes from its ability to retain information on the source redshifts along the entire analysis.",1
1342,2,"Usage of Cold Spraying of High-Heat-Capacity Coatings for the Increase of Low-$T_c$ Superconductors Stability The thermal stability of NbTi Rutherford-type cables was improved with cold spray technology, namely, by depositing high-heat-capacity coatings onto the surface of the superconductors. Two short samples of identical NbTi Rutherford-type cables with different metallic/ceramic coatings were prepared and tested. The spray particles were deposited onto the cables made of eight monofilamentary NbTi/Cu wires via supersonic velocity impact. The temperature of the process is much lower than the melting point of the sprayed material. The doped sample contained 1 vol.% of large-heat-capacity substance (LHCS) Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, whereas the comparison sample did not contain any LHCS. The average heat capacity of the doped sample at 4.2 K was increased more than two times. During the tests, both samples at LHe temperature were subjected to short (~1 ms) electromagnetic disturbances in the transverse constant magnetic field. It was found that the minimum quench energies for the sample with Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were 1.4-1.5 times higher than that for the comparison cable without LHCS. The described method is very promising for the stabilization of dense massive windings where the direct heat transfer to the LHe is hampered and the superconductor operates in almost adiabatic conditions.",1
1439,2,"Frame-dragging effect in the field of non rotating body due to unit gravimagnetic moment Nonminimal spin-gravity interaction through unit gravimagnetic moment leads to modified Mathisson–Papapetrou–Tulczyjew–Dixon equations with improved behavior in the ultrarelativistic limit. We present exact Hamiltonian of the resulting theory and compute an effective 1c2 -Hamiltonian and leading post-Newtonian corrections to the trajectory and spin. Gravimagnetic moment causes the same precession of spin S as a fictitious rotation of the central body with angular momentum J=MmS . So the modified equations imply a number of qualitatively new effects, that could be used to test experimentally, whether a rotating body in general relativity has null or unit gravimagnetic moment.",1
1447,2,"Neutron Disappearance and Regeneration from Mirror State The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that if the transformation of a neutron to a mirror neutron exists with an oscillation time of the order of 10 seconds, it can be detected in a rather simple disappearance and/or regeneration type experiment with an intense beam of cold neutrons. In the presence of a conjectural mirror magnetic field of unknown magnitude and direction, the resonance transformation conditions can be found by scanning the magnitude of the ordinary magnetic field in the range, e.g., ±100  μT. Magnetic field is assumed to be uniform along the path of the neutron beam. If the transformation effect exists within this range, the direction and possible time variation of the mirror magnetic field can be determined with additional dedicated measurements.",1

To optimizeinteraction length and maximize energy gain, operation at low plasma density isthe most promising regime for achieving ultra-relativistic energies. Among thepossible methods of extending propagation length at low plasma density, laserguiding by grazing incidence reflection at the wall of dielectric capillarytubes has several assets. The properties of laser guiding and the measurement ofplasma waves over long distances are presented.",1
1522,2,"Three- and four-body systems with the Functional Renormalization Group The Efimov effect arises in three-body systems near the unitary limit. Some of its features are universal, while others are not. This article uses a Functional-Renormalization- Group approach to discuss the Efimov effect and four-body systems. In this context, the Efimov effect appears as a consequence of the Renormalization-Group flow of couplings. On the four- body system, we find three tetramers below each Efimov trimer, and no evidence of four- body universality breaking. Two of these tetramers are in agreement with quantum-mechanical calculations and experimental results.",1
1634,2,"Dispersion by pulsars, magnetars, fast radio bursts and massive electromagnetism at very low radio frequencies Our understanding of the universe relies mostly on electromagnetism. As photons are the messengers, fundamental physics is concerned in testing their properties. Photon mass upper limits have been earlier set through pulsar observations, but new investigations are offered by the excess of dispersion measure (DM), sometimes observed with pulsar and magnetar data at low frequencies, or with the fast radio bursts (FRBs), of yet unknown origin. Arguments for the excess of DM do not reach a consensus, but are not mutually exclusive. Thus, we remind that for massive electromagnetism, dispersion goes as the inverse of the frequency squared. Thereby, new avenues are offered also by the recently operating ground observatories in 10–80 MHz domain and by the proposed Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio astronomy (OLFAR). The latter acts as a large aperture dish by employing a swarm of nano-satellites observing the sky for the first time in the 0.1–15 MHz spectrum. The swarm must be deployed sufficiently away from the ionosphere to avoid distorsions from terrestrial interference, especially during solar maxima, and offer stable conditions for calibration during observations.",1

1707,2,"Numerical solutions of Einstein field equations with radial dark matter We study a static spherically symmetric problem with a black hole and radially directed geodesic flows of dark matter. The obtained solutions have the following properties. At large distances, the gravitational field produces constant velocities of circular motion, i.e. flat rotation curves. At smaller distances, the field switches to Newtonian regime, then to Schwarzschild regime. Deviations from Schwarzschild regime start below the gravitational radius. The dark matter prevents the creation of event horizon, instead, a spherical region possessing extremely large redshift is created. The structure of space-time for the obtained solutions is investigated and the implications for the models of the galaxies are discussed.",1
1806,2,"On minimal energy states of chiral MHD turbulence We study the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence taking into account the chiral anomaly effect. This chiral magnetohydrodynamic description of the plasma is expected to be relevant for temperatures comparable to the electroweak scale, and therefore for the evolution of magnetic fields in the early Universe and young neutron stars. We focus on the case of freely decaying chiral magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and discuss the dissipation of ideal MHD invariants. Using the variational approach we discuss the minimum energy configurations of magnetic field and velocity. As in the case of the standard magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, we find that the natural relaxation state is given by a force-free field, $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} \propto \mathbf{B}$. However, the precise form of this configuration is now determined by parameters describing the chiral anomaly effect, leading to some important differences when compared to the non-chiral turbulence. Using this result we argue that the evolution of velocity and magnetic field will tend to effectively decouple during the transition to this minimal energy state.",1
1973,2,"Understanding the $\gamma$-ray emission from the globular cluster 47 Tuc: evidence for dark matter? 47 Tuc was the first globular cluster observed to be $\gamma$-ray bright, with the $\gamma$-rays being attributed to a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Recent kinematic data, combined with detailed simulations, appears to be consistent with the presence of an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) at the centre of 47 Tuc. Building upon this, we analyse 9 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations to study the spectral properties of 47 Tuc with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity. This 9-year $\gamma$-ray spectrum shows that 47 Tuc's $\gamma$-ray flux cannot be explained by MSPs alone, due to a systematic discrepancy between the predicted and observed flux. Rather, we find a significant preference (TS $=40$) for describing 47 Tuc's spectrum with a two source population model, consisting of an ensemble of MSPs and annihilating dark matter (DM) with an enhanced density around the IMBH, when compared to an MSP-only explanation. The best-fit DM mass of 34 GeV is essentially the same as the best-fit DM explanation for the Galactic centre ""excess"" when assuming DM annihilation into $b\bar{b}$ quarks. Our work constitutes the first possible evidence of dark matter within a globular cluster.",1
1974,2,"Conceptual design of a sapphire loaded coupler for superconducting radio-frequency 1.3 GHz cavities This paper explores a hybrid mode rf structure that served as a superconducting radio-frequency coupler. This application achieves a reflection S(1,1) varying from 0 to −30  db and delivers cw power at 7 KW. The coupler has good thermal isolation between the 2 and 300 K sections due to vacuum separation. Only one single hybrid mode can propagate through each section, and no higher order mode is coupled. The analytical and numerical analysis for this coupler is given and the design is optimized. The coupling mechanism to the cavity is also discussed.",1
1992,2,"Characterizing topological orders by the information convex Motivated by previous efforts in detecting topological orders from the ground state(s) wave function, we introduce a new quantum information tool, coined the information convex, to capture the bulk and boundary topological excitations of a 2D topological order. Defined as a set of reduced density matrices that minimizes the energy in a subsystem, the information convex encodes not only the bulk anyons but also the gapped boundaries of 2D topological orders. Using untwisted gapped boundaries of non-Abelian quantum doubles as an example, we show how the information convex reveal and characterize deconfined bulk and boundary topological excitations, and the condensation rule relating them. Interference experiments in cold atoms provide potential measurements for the invariant structure of information convex.",1
1996,2,"Cosmic ray production in supernovae We give a brief review of the origin and acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs), emphasizing the production of CRs at different stages of supernova evolution by the first-order Fermi shock acceleration mechanism. We suggest that supernovae with trans-relativistic outflows, despite being rather rare, may accelerate CRs to energies above $10^{18}\mbox{ eV}$ over the first year of their evolution. Supernovae in young compact clusters of massive stars, and interaction powered superluminous supernovae, may accelerate CRs well above the PeV regime. We discuss the acceleration of the bulk of the galactic CRs in isolated supernova remnants and re-acceleration of escaped CRs by the multiple shocks present in superbubbles produced by associations of OB stars. The effects of magnetic field amplification by CR driven instabilities, as well as superdiffusive CR transport, are discussed for nonthermal radiation produced by nonlinear shocks of all speeds including trans-relativistic ones.",1
2176,2,"Searching for Gravitational Waves from Compact Binaries with Precessing Spins Current searches for gravitational waves from compact-object binaries with the LIGO and Virgo observatories employ waveform models with spins aligned (or antialigned) with the orbital angular momentum. Here, we derive a new statistic to search for compact objects carrying generic (precessing) spins. Applying this statistic, we construct banks of both aligned- and generic-spin templates for binary black holes and neutron star–black hole binaries, and compare the effectualness of these banks towards simulated populations of generic-spin systems. We then use these banks in a pipeline analysis of Gaussian noise to measure the increase in background incurred by using generic- instead of aligned-spin banks. Although the generic-spin banks have roughly a factor of ten more templates than the aligned-spin banks, we find an overall improvement in signal recovery at a fixed false-alarm rate for systems with high-mass ratio and highly precessing spins. This gain in sensitivity comes at a small loss of sensitivity (≲4%) for systems that are already well covered by aligned-spin templates. Since the observation of even a single binary merger with misaligned spins could provide unique astrophysical insights into the formation of these sources, we recommend that the method described here be developed further to mount a viable search for generic-spin binary mergers in LIGO/Virgo data.",1
2234,2,"Extended Theory of Harmonic Maps Connects General Relativity to Chaos and Quantum Mechanism General relativity and quantum mechanism are two separate rules of modern physics explaining how nature works. Both theories are accurate, but the direct connection between two theories was not yet clarified. Recently, researchers blur the line between classical and quantum physics by connecting chaos and entanglement equation. Here, we showed the Duan's extended HM theory, which has the solution of the general relativity, can also have the solutions of the classic chaos equations and even the solution of Schrödinger equation in quantum physics, suggesting the extended theory of harmonic maps may act as a universal theory of physics.",1
2317,2,"Combination of measurements and the BLUE method The most accurate method to combine measurements from different experiments is to build a combined likelihood function and use it to perform the desired inference. This is not always possible for various reasons, hence approximate methods are often convenient. Among those, the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) is the most popular, allowing to take into account individual uncertainties and their correlations. The method is unbiased by construction if the true uncertainties and their correlations are known, but it may exhibit a bias if uncertainty estimates are used in place of the true ones, in particular if those estimated uncertainties depend on measured values. In those cases, an iterative application of the BLUE method may reduce the bias of the combinedmeasurement.",1
2338,2,"Dynamics of Particles Around a Regular Black Hole with Nonlinear Electrodynamics We investigate the dynamics of a charged particle being kicked off from its circular orbit around a regular black hole by an incoming massive particle in the presence of magnetic field. The resulting escape velocity, escape energy and the effective potential are analyzed. It is shown that the presence of even a very weak magnetic field helps the charged particles in escaping the gravitational field of the black hole. Moreover the effective force acting on the particle visibly reduces with distance. Thus particle near the black hole will experience higher effective force as compared to when it is far away.",1
2379,2,$Λnn$ bound state with three-body potential Formalism of the configuration-space Faddeev equations is applied to analyze the bound state problem of LambdaNN system. The simulated NSC97f potential for LambdaN interaction and semi-realistic NN potentials are used for calculations. We predict a broad Lambdann resonance near threshold. A spin dependent three-body LambdaNN potential has been proposed to explain experimental evidence for _Lambda^3 n bound state. The potential is defined by a Gaussian function of a hyper-radius. It was found that such potential with appropriate spin dependence does not support a bound state of _Lambda^3 n. A short range form of the potential generates non-physical solutions of the Faddeev equations.,1
2505,2,"Large Scale Structure And Baryogenesis We discuss a possible connection between the very large scale structure formation and
the baryogenesis in the universe.
An update review of the observational indications for the presence of a very large scale
120h−1 Mpc in the distribution of the visible matter of the universe is provided. The possibility
to generate a periodic distribution with the characteristic scale 120h−1 Mpc through a
mechanism producing quasiperiodic baryon density perturbations during inflationary stage,
is discussed. The evolution of the baryon charge density distribution is explored in the
framework of a low temperature boson condensate baryogenesis scenario.
The numerical analysis showed that both the observed very large scale of the visible
matter distribution in the universe and the observed baryon asymmetry value could naturally
appear as a result of the evolution of a complex scalar field condensate, formed at the
inflationary stage. Moreover, for some model’s parameters a natural separation of matter
superclusters from antimatter ones can be achieved.",1
2508,2,"Ground-state isolation and discrete flows in a rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator Ladder operators for the simplest version of a rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator (REQHO) are constructed by applying a Darboux transformation to the quantum harmonic oscillator system. It is shown that the physical spectrum of the REQHO carries a direct sum of a trivial and an infinite-dimensional irreducible representation of the polynomially deformed bosonized osp(1|2) superalgebra. In correspondence with this the ground state of the system is isolated from other physical states but can be reached by ladder operators via nonphysical energy eigenstates, which belong to either an infinite chain of similar eigenstates or to the chains with generalized Jordan states. We show that the discrete chains of the states generated by ladder operators and associated with physical energy levels include six basic generalized Jordan states, in comparison with the two basic Jordan states entering in analogous discrete chains for the quantum harmonic oscillator.",1
2512,2,Search for continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars in globular cluster NGC 6544 We describe a directed search for continuous gravitational waves in data from the sixth initial LIGO science run. The target was the nearby globular cluster NGC 6544 at a distance of ≈2.7  kpc. The search covered a broad band of frequencies along with first and second frequency derivatives for a fixed sky position. The search coherently integrated data from the two LIGO interferometers over a time span of 9.2 days using the matched-filtering F-statistic. We found no gravitational-wave signals and set 95% confidence upper limits as stringent as 6.0×10-25 on intrinsic strain and 8.5×10-6 on fiducial ellipticity. These values beat the indirect limits from energy conservation for stars with characteristic spin-down ages older than 300 years and are within the range of theoretical predictions for possible neutron-star ellipticities. An important feature of this search was use of a barycentric resampling algorithm which substantially reduced computational cost; this method is used extensively in searches of Advanced LIGO and Virgo detector data.,1
2520,2,"Proposal of Readout Electronics for CSNS-WNS BaF2 Detector BaF2 (Barium fluoride) detector is one of the experiment facilities at the under construction CSNS-WNS (White Neutron Source at China Spallation Neutron Source).

In this proposal for readout electronics, waveform digitizing technique with 1GSps sampling rate and 12-bit resolution is adopted to precisely capture the detector signal. To solve the problem of massive data readout and processing, the readout electronics system is designed into a distributed architecture with 4 PXIe crates. The digitized detector's signal is concentrated to PXIe crate controller through PCIe bus on backplane and transmitted to data acquisition system over Gigabit Ethernet in parallel.

We find that, for these two models, there is no evidence of the dynamical dark energy at the 1.2σ confidence level. Interestingly, both models could slightly alleviate (i) the current Hubble constant (H0) tension between the global fitting derivation by the Planck collaboration and the local observation by Riess et al.; (ii) the root-mean-square density fluctuations (σ8) tension between the Planck-2015 data and several low-redshift large scale structure probes.",1
2546,2,"The Soreq Applied Research Accelerator Facility (SARAF) - Overview, Research Programs and Future Plans The Soreq Applied Research Accelerator Facility (SARAF) is under construction in the Soreq Nuclear Research Center at Yavne, Israel. When completed at the beginning of the next decade, SARAF will be a user facility for basic and applied nuclear physics, based on a 40 MeV, 5 mA CW proton/deuteron superconducting linear accelerator. Phase I of SARAF (SARAF-I, 4 MeV, 2 mA CW protons, 5 MeV 1 mA CW deuterons) is already in operation, generating scientific results in several fields of interest. The main ongoing program at SARAF-I is the production of 30 keV neutrons and measurement of Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections (MACS), important for the astrophysical s-process. The world leading Maxwellian epithermal neutron yield at SARAF-I ( $5 \times 10^{10}$ epithermal neutrons/s), generated by a novel Liquid-Lithium Target (LiLiT), enables improved precision of known MACSs, and new measurements of low-abundance and radioactive isotopes. Research plans for SARAF-II span several disciplines: precision studies of beyond-Standard-Model effects by trapping light exotic radioisotopes, such as$^{6}$He,$^{8}$Li and$^{18, 19, 23}$Ne, in unprecedented amounts (including meaningful studies already at SARAF-I), extended nuclear astrophysics research with higher energy neutrons, including generation and studies of exotic neutron-rich isotopes relevant to the rapid (r-) process, nuclear structure of exotic isotopes, high energy neutron cross sections for basic nuclear physics and material science research, including neutron induced radiation damage, neutron based imaging and therapy, and novel radiopharmaceuticals development and production.

2570,2,"Analytic formulas for the rapid evaluation of the orbit response matrix and chromatic functions from lattice parameters in circular accelerators Measurements and analysis of orbit response matrix have been providing for decades a formidable tool in the detection of linear lattice imperfections and their correction. Basically all storage- ring-based synchrotron light sources across the world make routinely use of this technique in their daily operation, reaching in some cases a correction of linear optics down to 1% beta beating and 0.1% coupling. During the design phase of a new storage ring it is also applied in simulations for the evaluation of magnetic and mechanical tolerances. However, this technique is known for its intrinsic slowness compared to other methods based on turn-by-turn beam position data, both in the measurement and in the data analysis. In this paper analytic formulas are derived and discussed that shall greatly speed up this second part. The mathematical formalism based on the Lie algebra and the resonance driving terms is extended to the off-momentum regime and explicit analytic formulas for the evaluation of chromatic functions from lattice parameters are also derived. The robustness of these formulas, which are linear in the magnet strengths, is tested with different lattice configurations.",1
2663,2,"Using High­ Precision Beam Position Monitors at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) to Measure the One­ Way Speed of Light Anisotropy The Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) has been equipped with a number of high-precision beam position monitors which are capable of measuring the orbit of a circulating beam with a precision of a few microns. This technology will enable a precision measurement of deviations in the one-way speed of light. An anisotropic speed of light will alter the beam momentum as it travels around the ring, resulting in a change of orbit over the course of a sidereal day. Using counter-circulating electron and positron beams, we will be able to suppress many of the systematics such as those relating to variations in RF voltage or magnet strength. We show here initial feasibility studies to measure the stability of our beam position monitors and the various systematic effects which may hide our signal and discuss ways in which we can minimize their impact.",1
2674,2,"Are Gravitational Waves Spinning Down PSR J1023+0038 ? The pulsar J1023+0038 rotates with a frequency ν≈592  Hz and has been observed to transition between a radio state, during which it is visible as a millisecond radio pulsar, and a low-mass x-ray binary (LMXB) state, during which accretion powered x-ray pulsations are visible. Timing during the two phases reveals that during the LMXB phase the neutron star is spinning down at a rate of ν˙≈-3×10-15  Hz/s, which is approximately 27% faster than the rate measured during the radio phase, ν˙≈-2.4×10-15  Hz/s, and is at odds with the predictions of accretion models. We suggest that the increase in spin-down rate is compatible with gravitational wave emission, particularly with the creation of a “mountain” during the accretion phase. We show that asymmetries in pycnonuclear reaction rates in the crust can lead to a large enough mass quadrupole to explain the observed spin-down rate, which thus far has no other self-consistent explanation. We also suggest two observational tests of this scenario, involving radio timing at the onset of the next millisecond radio pulsar phase, when the mountain should dissipate, and accurate timing during the next LMXB phase to track the increase in torque as the mountain builds up. Another possibility is that an unstable r mode with an amplitude α≈5×10-8 may be present in the system.",1
2681,2,"Computation of the general relativistic perihelion precession and of light deflection via the Laplace-Adomian Decomposition Method We study the equations of motion of the massive and massless particles in the Schwarzschild geometry of general relativity by using the Laplace-Adomian Decomposition Method, which proved to be extremely successful in obtaining series solutions to a wide range of strongly nonlinear differential and integral equations. After introducing a general formalism for the derivation of the equations of motion in arbitrary spherically symmetric static geometries, and of the general mathematical formalism of the Laplace-Adomian Decomposition Method, we obtain the series solution of the geodesics equation in the Schwarzschild geometry. The truncated series solution, containing only five terms, can reproduce the exact numerical solution with a high precision. In the first order of approximation we reobtain the standard expression for the perihelion precession. We study in detail the bending angle of light by compact objects in several orders of approximation. The extension of this approach to more general geometries than the Schwarzschild one is also briefly discussed.",1
2727,2,"Extragalactic Background Light: Measurements and Applications This review covers the measurements related to the extragalactic background light (EBL) intensity from gamma-rays to radio in the electromagnetic spectrum over 20 decades in the wavelength. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) remains the best measured spectrum with an accuracy better than 1%. The measurements related to the cosmic optical background (COB), centered at 1 microns, are impacted by the large zodiacal light associated with interplanetary dust in the inner Solar system. The best measurements of COB come from an indirect technique involving Gamma-ray spectra of bright blazars with an absorption feature resulting from pair-production off of COB photons. The cosmic infrared background (CIB) peaking at around 100 microns established an energetically important background with an intensity comparable to the optical background. This discovery paved the path for large aperture far-infrared and sub-millimeter observations resulting in the discovery of dusty, starbursting galaxies. Their role in galaxy formation and evolution remains an active area of research in modern-day astrophysics. The extreme UV background remains mostly unexplored and will be a challenge to measure due to the high Galactic background and absorption of extragalactic photons by the intergalactic medium at these EUV/soft X-ray energies. We also summarize our understanding of the spatial anisotropies and angular power spectra of intensity fluctuations. We motivate a precise direct measurement of the COB between 0.1 to 5 microns using a small aperture telescope observing either from the outer Solar system, at distances of 5 AU or more, or out of the ecliptic plane. Other future applications include improving our understanding of the background at TeV energies and spectral distortions of CMB and CIB.",1
2792,2,"First Results of GINGERino, a deep underground ringlaser Large ring-laser gyroscopes are capable of measuring angular rotations with a precision well below fractions of $prad/s$, not far from $10^{-14}$ $rad/s$, the accuracy required for General Relativity tests, this is what the GINGER (Gyroscope-IN-GEneral-Relativity) experiment is aiming for. These features do not guarantee the possibility of measuring the General Relativity Lense--Thirring effect, that manifests itself as a tiny ($\approx 10^{-9} \times \Omega_E$) perturbation of the Earth rotation rate. An underground location being in principle less affected by external local disturbances represents a good candidate for housing such a challenging experiment. GINGERino is a test apparatus to investigate the residual local disturbances in the most inner part of the underground international laboratory of the GranSasso (LNGS). It consists of a square ring laser with a $3.6$ m side. The instrument has been tailored to be the larger allowed by the particular location inside the laboratory. Its main objective is to measure the very low frequency rotational motions, in order to prove that LNGS is a suitable location for very low noise measurements and, possibly, General Relativity tests. Aside this main goal, GINGERino will provide unique data for geodesy and geophysics. Its installation has been completed during 2015. Since then, several long set of data have been collected, and the apparatus has been continuously running unattended for more than one week. The typical power spectrum sensitivity was a few $ 10^{-10} rad/s/\sqrt(Hz)$, with integration time not longer than tens of seconds. Improvements of the apparatus are ongoing in order to improve the integration time.",1

2826,2,"The EUSO@TurLab Project The TurLab facility is a laboratory, equipped with a 5 m diameter and 1 m depth rotating tank, located in the Physics Department of the University of Turin. The tank has been built mainly to study problems where system rotation plays a key role in the fluid behaviour such as in atmospheric and oceanic flows at different scales. The tank can be filled with different fluids of variable density, which enables studies in layered conditions such as sea waves. The tank can be also used to simulate the terrestrial surface with the optical characteristics of different environments such as snow, grass, ocean, land with soil, stones etc., fogs and clouds. As it is located in an extremely dark place, the light intensity can be controlled artificially. Such capabilities of the TurLab facility are applied to perform experiments related to the observation of Extreme Energy Cosmic Rays (EECRs) from space using the fluorescence technique, as in the case of the JEM-EUSO mission, where the diffuse night brightness and artificial light sources can vary significantly in time and space inside the Field of View (FoV) of the telescope.

2840,2,"Classical static final state of collapse with supertranslation memory The Kerr metric models the final classical black hole state after gravitational collapse of matter and radiation. Any stationary metric which is close to the Kerr metric has been proven to be diffeomorphic to it. Now, finite supertranslation diffeomorphisms are symmetries which map solutions to inequivalent solutions as such diffeomorphisms generate conserved superrotation charges. The final state of gravitational collapse is therefore parameterized by its mass, angular momentum and supertranslation field, signaled by its conserved superrotation charges. In this paper, we first derive the angle-dependent energy conservation law relating the asymptotic value of the supertranslation field of the final state to the details of the collapse and subsequent evolution of the system. We then generate the static solution with an asymptotic supertranslation field and we study some of its properties. Up to a caveat, the deviation from the Schwarzschild metric could therefore be predicted on a case-by-case basis from accurate modeling of the angular dependence of the ingoing and outgoing energy fluxes leading to the final state.",1

We review here the astrophysical tests which have been carried out so far to check if CPR exists. These are using the radio and ultraviolet polarization of radio galaxies and the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (both E-mode and B-mode). These tests so far have been negative, leading to upper limits of the order of one degree on any CPR angle, thereby increasing our confidence in those physical principles, including GR. We also discuss future prospects in detecting CPR or improving the constraints on it.",1
2993,2,"Accoustic Localization of Breakdown in Radio Frequency Accelerating Cavities Current designs for muon accelerators require high-gradient radio frequency (RF) cavities to be placed in solenoidal magnetic fields. These fields help contain and efficiently reduce the phase space volume of source muons in order to create a usable muon beam for collider and neutrino experiments. In this context and in general, the use of RF cavities in strong magnetic fields has its challenges. It has been found that placing normal conducting RF cavities in strong magnetic fields reduces the threshold at which RF cavity breakdown occurs. To aid the effort to study RF cavity breakdown in magnetic fields, it would be helpful to have a diagnostic tool which can localize the source of breakdown sparks inside the cavity. These sparks generate thermal shocks to small regions of the inner cavity wall that can be detected and localized using microphones attached to the outer cavity surface. Details on RF cavity sound sources as well as the hardware, software, and algorithms used to localize the source of sound emitted from breakdown thermal shocks are presented. In addition, results from simulations and experiments on three RF cavities, namely the Aluminum Mock Cavity, the High-Pressure Cavity, and the Modular Cavity, are also given. These results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the described technique for acoustic localization of breakdown.",1
3042,2,"Searching for Dark Sectors The existence of Dark Matter suggests the presence of a dark sector, consisting of particles
neutral under all Standard Model forces. Various “portals” can connect the dark sector to
the Standard Model sector. Two popular examples are the vector portal, which gives rise
to a “dark photon” (A0
), and the Higgs portal, which gives rise to a “dark Higgs”. Such
dark forces appear in many well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. In some cases,
they may resolve discrepancies between experimental data and theoretical predictions, such
as the muon anomalous magnetic moment. We show that dark sectors and forces can be
constrained from several novel probes in current and future experiments, including monophoton
searches in low-energy positron-electron colliders, rare muon decays in the Mu3e,
and exotic Higgs decays at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
We first investigate the power of low-energy, high-luminosity electron–positron colliders to
probe dark sectors with a mass below ⇠ 10 GeV, which couple to Standard Model particles
through a low-mass dark mediator. Dark matter candidates in this mass range are wellmotivated
and can give rise to distinctive mono-photon signals at B-factories and similar
experiments. We use data from an existing mono-photon search by BABAR to place new
constraints on this class of models, and give projections for the sensitivity of a similar search
at a future B-factory such as Belle II. We find that the sensitivity of such searches are more powerful than searches at other collider or fixed-target facilities for dark-sector mediators and
particles with masses between a few hundred MeV and 10 GeV. We compare our results to
existing and future direct detection experiments and show that low-energy colliders provide
an indispensable and complementary avenue to search for light dark matter.
We also find that dark photons with masses ⇠ 10 MeV–80 MeV can probed in the rare
muon decay process µ+ ! e+⌫e⌫¯µA0
, A0 ! e+e,
in the upcoming Mu3e experiment at the
Paul Scherrer Institute without modifying the experimental set-up. We show that the Mu3e
has an exciting opportunity to probe a large fraction of unexplored dark photon parameter
space, probing kinetic-mixing parameter, ✏, as low as 104
by the end of the experiment.
The newly discovered 125 GeV Higgs boson is a scalar and has a small Standard Model
decay width. Hence it can easily decay to light dark-sector particles with sizable branching
ratios. We investigate several possible dark-sector searches at the LHC based on the exotic
decays of the Higgs. We also analyze in detail a possible decay to b¯bµ+µ
via intermediate
scalar states. We find the branching ratio of the exotic Higgs decay can be constrained at
the few ⇥105
level across a wide range of mass for the intermediate scalars at the high
luminosity LHC.
Finally, we show a possible dark-sector interpretation of the recently reported 750 GeV
diphoton excess from the LHC 13 TeV Run, as the 750 GeV heavy resonance decaying to
light dark photons or dark Higgs bosons. Such decays may pass the photon selection criteria
and fake diphoton events. We investigate two scenarios where the 750 GeV heavy resonance
is a spin-0 or spin-1 particle and estimate the parameters of the models to explain the existing
excess.",1

We show that in the presence of entropy increase its cycles grow in size and age, increasingly approaching flatness. But these cycles also grow increasingly anisotropic at their expansion maxima.

3147,2,"Enriching the Symphony of Gravitational Waves from Binary Black Holes by Tuning Higher Harmonics For the first time, we construct an inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model within the effective-one-body formalism for spinning, nonprecessing binary black holes that includes gravitational modes beyond the dominant $(\ell,|m|) = (2,2)$ mode, specifically $(\ell,|m|)=(2,1),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5)$. Our multipolar waveform model incorporates recent (resummed) post-Newtonian results for the inspiral and information from 157 numerical-relativity simulations, and 13 waveforms from black-hole perturbation theory for the (plunge-)merger and ringdown. We quantify the improved accuracy including higher-order modes by computing the faithfulness of the waveform model against the numerical-relativity waveforms used to construct the model. We define the faithfulness as the match maximized over time, phase of arrival, gravitational-wave polarization and sky position of the waveform model, and averaged over binary orientation, gravitational-wave polarization and sky position of the numerical-relativity waveform. When the waveform model contains only the $(2,2)$ mode, we find that the averaged faithfulness to numerical-relativity waveforms containing all modes with $\ell \leq$ 5 ranges from $90\%$ to $99.9\%$ for binaries with total mass $20-200 M_\odot$ (using the Advanced LIGO's design noise curve). By contrast, when the $(2,1),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5)$ modes are also included in the model, the faithfulness improves to $99\%$ for all but four configurations in the numerical-relativity catalog, for which the faithfulness is greater than $98.5\%$. Using our results, we also develop also a (stand-alone) waveform model for the merger-ringdown signal, calibrated to numerical-relativity waveforms, which can be used to measure multiple quasi-normal modes. The multipolar waveform model can be extended to include spin-precession, and will be employed in upcoming observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Virgo.",1
3177,2,"Classical polymerization of the Schwarzschild metric We study a spherically symmetric setup consisting of a Schwarzschild metric as the background geometry in the framework of classical polymerization. This process is an extension of the polymeric representation of quantum mechanics in such a way that a transformation maps classical variables to their polymeric counterpart. We show that the usual Schwarzschild metric can be extracted from a Hamiltonian function which in turn, gets modifications due to the classical polymerization. Then, the polymer corrected Schwarzschild metric may be obtained by solving the polymer-Hamiltonian equations of motion. It is shown that while the conventional Schwarzschild space-time is a vacuum solution of the Einstein equations, its polymer-corrected version corresponds to an energy-momentum tensor that exhibits the features of dark energy. We also use the resulting metric to investigate some thermodynamical quantities associated to the Schwarzschild black hole, and in comparison with the standard Schwarzschild metric the similarities and differences are discussed.",1
3224,2,"Constraints on the dark energy dipole from large-scale structures The high-significance measurement of large-scale structure signals enables testing the isotropy of the Universe. The measurement of cosmological parameters through the large-scale distribution of matter is now a mature domain. This approach is mainly limited by our knowledge of astrophysical processes that are used to observe the large-scale structure. However, when we assume that these astrophysical processes are the same across the Universe, then it is possible to tightly constrain the isotropy of cosmological parameters across the sky. Particularly the X-SZ cross-correlation has been shown to be a probe of the large scale structures that has a high signal-to-noise ratio and low bias. For this analysis, we used a localized measurement of the X-SZ cross-correlation as a test of the cosmological parameter isotropy. Using the scatter of the X-SZ cross-correlation across the sky, we derive cosmological constraints sigma_8(Omega_m/ 0.28)^0.34 = 0.78 +- 0.02 and tight isotropy constraints on the dark energy dipole DeltaOmega_Lambda at 95% confidence level.",1
3249,2,"Are redshift-space distortions actually a probe of growth of structure? We present an impact of coupling between dark matter and a scalar field, which might be responsible for dark energy, on measurements of redshift-space distortions. We point out that, in the presence of conformal and/or disformal coupling, linearized continuity and Euler equations for total matter fluid significantly deviate from the standard ones even in the sub-horizon scales. In such a case, a peculiar velocity of total matter field is determined not only by a logarithmic time derivative of its density perturbation but also by density perturbations for both dark matter and baryon, leading to a large modification of the physical interpretation of observed data obtained by measurements of redshift-space distortions. We reformulate galaxy two-point correlation function in the redshift space based on the modified continuity and Euler equations. We conclude from the resultant formula that the true value of the linear growth rate of large-scale structure cannot be necessarily constrained by single-redshift measurements of the redshift-space distortions, unless one observes the actual time-evolution of structure.",1

3357,2,"Evidence for a Time Lag in Solar Modulation of Galactic Cosmic Rays The solar modulation effect of cosmic rays in the heliosphere is an energy-, time-, and particle-dependent phenomenon that arises from a combination of basic particle transport processes such as diffusion, convection, adiabatic cooling, and drift motion. Making use of a large collection of time-resolved cosmic-ray data from recent space missions, we construct a simple predictive model of solar modulation that depends on direct solar-physics inputs: the number of solar sunspots and the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet. Under this framework, we present calculations of cosmic-ray proton spectra, positron/electron and antiproton/proton ratios, and their time dependence in connection with the evolving solar activity. We report evidence for a time lag ${\rm{\Delta }}T=8.1\pm \,1.2$ months, between solar-activity data and cosmic-ray flux measurements in space, which reflects the dynamics of the formation of the modulation region. This result enables us to forecast the cosmic-ray flux near Earth well in advance by monitoring solar activity.",1
3386,2,"Universality of the halo mass function in screened gravity theories We examine the efficacy of the halo mass function as a probe of $f(R)$, symmetron and DGP gravity. We develop an excursion-set method to generalise a range of popular HMF fitting functions from GR to screened MG, considering the HMF dependence on the critical density parameter $\delta_{c}$. In particular, we propose a variety of new methods to account for the environmental dependence of chameleon screening and compare their accuracy to existing ones via $N$-body data. Finally, using the nested sampling routine MultiNest, we examine two possible interpretations of the MG $N$-body results: whether they can be interpreted as $\Lambda$CDM HMFs and whether the MG HMFs display any universality. We find that the effects of MG can be interpreted as a change in best-fit parameters in the $\Lambda$CDM HMF---i.e. can be mistaken for GR---for all of the fitting functions. Alternatively, the relation can be inverted to judge the universality of the HMF---not in terms of its purported invariance to $z$, $H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ as in GR, but its independence on the underlying theory of gravity. Although we found no completely universal HMF, the parameter values did cluster according to the type of screening mechanism. The results suggest that a single, best-fit HMF might be used for each type of screening, independent of the parameters in the MG model. This demonstrates that the additional complexity of the gravitational collapse in screened MG theories cannot always be accounted for using the techniques developed in GR. However, the variations are small enough that it is unnecessary to develop new fitting functions and calibrate them on a case-by-case basis.",1

3388,2,"The uses of isospin in early nuclear and particle physics This paper reconstructs the early history of isospin up to and including its employment in 1951 52 to conceptualize high-energy pion-proton scattering. Studying the history of isospin serves as an entry point for investigating the interplay of theoretical and experimental practices in early nuclear and particle physics, showing the complexity of processes of knowledge construction which have often been presented as straightforward both in physicists׳ recollections and in the historiography of science. The story of isospin has often been told in terms of the discovery of the first “intrinsic property” of elementary particles, but I will argue that the isospin formalism emerged and was further developed because it proved to be a useful tool to match theory and experiment within the steadily broadening field of high-energy (nuclear) physics. Isospin was variously appropriated and adapted in the course of two decades, before eventually the physical-mathematical implications of its uses started being spelled out. The case study also highlights some interesting features of high-energy physics around 1950: the contribution to post-war research of theoretical methods developed before and during the war, the role of young theoretical post-docs in mediating between theorists and experimenters, and the importance of traditional formalisms such as those of spin and angular momentum as a template both for formalizing and conceptualizing experimental results.",1

A correspondence between the deflection angle of light and the surface integral of the Gaussian curvature may allow us to take account of the finite distance from a lens object to a light source and a receiver. Using this relation, we propose a method for calculating the bending angle of light for such cases. Finally, this method is applied to two examples of the nonasymptotically flat spacetimes to suggest finite-distance corrections: the Kottler (Schwarzschild–de Sitter) solution to the Einstein equation and an exact solution in Weyl conformal gravity.",1

A census of galaxy clusters sets constraints on reionization mechanisms and epochs, which need to be reconciled with recent limits on the reionization optical depth from cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. Future advances in SZ effect measurements will include the possibility to (unambiguously) measure directly the kinematic SZ effect, to build an even larger catalogue of galaxy clusters able to study the high redshift universe, and to make (spatially-)resolved galaxy cluster maps with even spectral capability to (spectrally-)resolve the relativistic corrections of the SZ effect.",1
3558,2,"A Particle Model Explaining Mass and Relativity in a Physical Way Physicists’ understanding of relativity and the way it is handled is up to present days dominated by the interpretation of Albert Einstein, who related relativity to specific properties of space and time. The principal alternative to Einstein’s interpretation is based on a concept proposed by Hendrik A. Lorentz, which uses knowledge of classical physics alone to explain relativistic phenomena. In this paper, we will show that on the one hand the Lorentz-based interpretation provides a simpler mathematical way of arriving at the known results for both Special and General Relativity. On the other hand, it is able to solve problems which have remained open to this day. Furthermore, a particle model will be presented, based on Lorentzian relativity and the quantum mechanical concept of Louis de Broglie, which explains the origin of mass without the use of the Higgs mechanism. It is based on the finiteness of the speed of light and provides classical results for particle properties which are currently only accessible through quantum mechanics.

3599,2,"The impact of the quantized transverse motion on radiation emission in a Dirac harmonic oscillator We investigate the radiation emitted by an ultrarelativistic electron traveling in a 1-dimensional parabolic potential. Having in mind a simplified model for beamstrahlung, we consider the realistic case of the electron motion being highly directional, with the transverse momentum being much smaller than the longitudinal one. In this case we can find solutions of the Dirac equation and we calculate exactly the radiation emission using first-order perturbation theory. We compare the results obtained to that obtained via the semi-classical method of Baier and Katkov which includes quantum effects due to photon recoil in the radiation emission but ignores the quantum nature of the electron motion. On the one hand, we confirm a prediction of the semi-classical method that the emission spectrum should coincide with that in the case of a linearly polarized monochromatic wave. On the other hand, however, we find that the semi-classical method does not yield the exact result when the quantum number describing the transverse motion becomes small. In this way, we address quantitatively the problem of the limits of validity of the semi-classical method, which is known, generally speaking, to be applicable for large quantum numbers. Finally, we also discuss which beam conditions would be necessary to enter the studied regime where also the motion of the particles must be considered quantum mechanically to yield the correct spectrum.",1

The relational program proposed is based on the best-matching framework originally developed by Julian Barbour. In particular, the paper focuses on the conceptual problems that arise when trying to implement such a program. It is argued that pursuing a relational strategy in the Bohmian context leads to a more parsimonious ontology than that of standard Bohmian mechanics without betraying the original motivations for adopting a primitive ontology approach to quantum physics. It is also shown how a relational Bohmian approach might clarify the issue of the timelessness of the dynamics resulting from the quantization of a classical relational system of particles.",1

In addition to samples of “ordinary” scintillator with additions of 2% p- Terphenyl + 0.05% POPOP, the rapid ultraviolet scintillator with single 2% additive PBD was tested.

As the photo detectors silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) produced by CPTA (Russia) and SensL (Ireland) were used. It is shown that the dependence of light output on the thickness of scintillator is nonlinear and close to the square root function, which is also confirmed by the calculations carried out by Monte Carlo.

The result has a natural quantum information theoretic interpretation as the entanglement of a state where each quasi-particle is associated with two qubits representing their presence within and without the entanglement region, taking into account quantum (in)distinguishability. This applies to any excited state composed of finite numbers of quasi-particles with finite De Broglie wavelengths or finite intrinsic correlation length. We derive this result analytically in one-dimensional massive bosonic and fermionic free field theories and for simple setups in higher dimensions. We provide numerical evidence for the harmonic chain and the two-dimensional harmonic lattice in all regimes where excitations have quasi-particle properties. Finally, we provide supporting calculations for integrable spin chain models and other situations without particle production. Our results point to new possibilities for creating entangled states using many-body quantum systems.",1
4015,2,"One hundred years of the cosmological constant: from “superfluous stunt” to dark energy We present a centennial review of the history of the term known as the cosmological constant. First introduced to the general theory of relativity by Einstein in 1917 in order to describe a universe that was assumed to be static, the term fell from favour in the wake of the discovery of the expanding universe, only to make a dramatic return in recent times. We consider historical and philosophical aspects of the cosmological constant over four main epochs, (i) the use of the term in static cosmologies (both Newtonian and relativistic): (ii) the marginalization of the term following the discovery of cosmic expansion: (iii) the use of the term to address specific cosmic puzzles such as the timespan of expansion, the formation of galaxies and the redshifts of the quasars: (iv) the re-emergence of the term in today’s Λ-CDM cosmology. We find that the cosmological constant was never truly banished from theoretical models of the universe, but was marginalized by astronomers for reasons of convenience. We also find that the return of the term to the forefront of modern cosmology did not occur as an abrupt paradigm shift due to one particular set of observations, but as the result of a number of empirical advances such as the measurement of present cosmic expansion using the Hubble Space Telescope, the measurement of past expansion using type SN Ia supernovae as standard candles, and the measurement of perturbations in the cosmic microwave background by balloon and satellite. We give a brief overview of contemporary interpretations of the physics underlying the cosmic constant and conclude with a synopsis of the famous cosmological constant problem.",1
4061,2,"Radio Pulsars: The Neutron Star Population & Fundamental Physics Radio pulsars are unique laboratories for a wide range of physics and astrophysics. Understanding how they are created, how they evolve and where we find them in the Galaxy, with or without binary companions, is highly constraining of theories of stellar and binary evolution. Pulsars' relationship with a recently discovered variety of apparently different classes of neutron stars is an interesting modern astrophysical puzzle which we consider in Part I of this review. Radio pulsars are also famous for allowing us to probe the laws of nature at a fundamental level. They act as precise cosmic clocks and, when in a binary system with a companion star, provide indispensable venues for precision tests of gravity. The different applications of radio pulsars for fundamental physics will be discussed in Part II. We finish by making mention of the newly discovered class of astrophysical objects, the Fast Radio Bursts, which may or may not be related to radio pulsars or neutron stars, but which were discovered in observations of the latter.",1
4063,2,"Multipartite analysis of average-subsystem entropies So-called average subsystem entropies are defined by first taking partial traces over some pure state to define density matrices, then calculating the subsystem entropies, and finally averaging over the pure states to define the average subsystem entropies. These quantities are standard tools in quantum information theory, most typically applied in bipartite systems. We shall first present some extensions to the usual bipartite analysis (including a calculation of the average tangle and a bound on the average concurrence), follow this with some useful results for tripartite systems, and finally extend the discussion to arbitrary multipartite systems. A particularly nice feature of tripartite and multipartite analyses is that this framework allows one to introduce an “environment” to which small subsystems can couple.",1

4141,2,"New insights from cosmic gamma rays The measurement of gamma rays from cosmic sources at ~MeV energies is one of the key tools for nuclear astrophysics, in its study of nuclear reactions and their impacts on objects and phenomena throughout the universe. Gamma rays trace nuclear processes most directly, as they originate from nuclear transitions following radioactive decays or high-energy collisions with excitation of nuclei. Additionally, the unique gamma-ray signature from the annihilation of positrons falls into this astronomical window and is discussed here: Cosmic positrons are often produced from β-decays, thus also of nuclear physics origins. The nuclear reactions leading to radioactive isotopes occur inside stars and stellar explosions, which therefore constitute the main objects of such studies. In recent years, both thermonuclear and core-collapse supernova radioactivities have been measured though (56)Ni, (56)Co, and (44)Ti lines, and a beginning has thus been made to complement conventional supernova observations with such measurements of the prime energy sources of supernova light created in their deep interiors. The diffuse radioactive afterglow of massive-star nucleosynthesis in gamma rays is now being exploited towards astrophysical studies on how massive stars feed back their energy and ejecta into interstellar gas, as part of the cosmic cycle of matter through generations of stars enriching the interstellar gas and stars with metals. Large interstellar cavities and superbubbles have been recognised to be the dominating structures where new massive-star ejecta are injected, from (26)Al gamma-ray spectroscopy. Also, constraints on the complex interiors of stars derive from the ratio of (60)Fe/(26)Al gamma rays. Finally, the puzzling bulge-dominated intensity distribution of positron annihilation gamma rays is measured in greater detail, but still not understood, a recent microquasar flare provided evidence that such objects may be prime sources for positrons in interstellar space, rather than distributed nucleosynthesis. We also briefly discuss the status and prospects for astronomy with telescopes for the nuclear-radiation energy window.",1
4182,2,"Low Emittance Lattice for DAFNE gamma factory An experiment of gamma rays production using Compton collisions between the DAΦNE electron beam and a high average power laser, amplified in a Fabry-Pérot optical resonator, has been proposed and is described in [1]. The proposed gamma beam source has extremely interesting properties in terms of spectral density, energy spread and gamma flux comparable, and even better, with the latest generation gamma sources. An accelerator layout and a set of DAΦNE parameters dedicated to the gamma beam experiments were presented in [1]. The present DAΦNE horizontal emittance is εx = 0.28 mm mrad, a lower emittance would enhance the gamma beam brillance. The conclusion of the previous study was that the beam parameters presented in [1] can be better achieved with an emittance between 0.1 and 0.2 mm-mrad. A lattice designed to satisfy the parameters listed in Table 1 of [1], with a natural horizontal emittance εx = 0.163 mm-mrad and with a layout of the straight section optimized for the installation of the Fabry Perot cavity, is presented in this report.",1
4196,2,"Estimating spacetime parameters with a quantum probe in a lossy environment We study the problem of estimating the Schwarzschild radius of a massive body using Gaussian quantum probe states. Previous calculations assumed that the probe state remained pure after propagating a large distance. In a realistic scenario, there would be inevitable losses. Here we introduce a practical approach to calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for a quantum probe that has passed through a lossy channel. While for many situations loss means coherent states are optimal, we identify certain situations for which squeezed states have an advantage. We also study the effect of the frequency profile of the wave packet propagating from Alice to Bob. There exists an optimal operating point for a chosen mode profile. In particular, employing a smooth rectangular frequency profile significantly improves the error bound on the Schwarzschild radius compared to a Gaussian frequency profile.",1

4540,2,"Imprints of Chameleon f(R) Gravity on Galaxy Rotation Curves Screened modified gravity models are viable alternatives to dark energy for driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe. They can exhibit complex behaviour on galactic and intergalactic scales, where current constraints on gravity are relatively weak, without violating stringent Solar System tests. In this work, we explore the viability of using the kinematics of galaxies to constrain screened modified gravity models. We focus on chameleon f(R) gravity and predict its impact on galaxy rotation curves and radial acceleration relations. This is achieved by post-processing state-of-the-art simulations of disc galaxy formation from the Auriga Project, using the MG-Gadget modified gravity code. We find that for a given galaxy, the surface dividing screened and unscreened regions adopts an oblate shape, reflecting the disc morphology of the galaxy. At the 'screening radius'---the radius at which screening is triggered in the disc plane---characteristic 'upturns' are present in both rotation curves and radial acceleration relations. The location of these features depends on various factors, such as the galaxy mass, the concentration of the density profile and the value of the background field amplitude fR0. Self-screening of stars and environmental screening also play a role. For Milky Way-size galaxies, we find that a model with $|\bar{f}_\mathrm{R0}|=10^{-7}$ results in rotation curves that are indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM, while for $|\bar{f}_\mathrm{R0}| \geq 2 \times 10^{-6}$ the simulated galaxies are entirely unscreened, violating Solar System constraints. For intermediate values, distinct upturns are present. With careful statistical analyses of observed rotation curves, constraints on f(R) gravity with a sensitivity down to $|\bar{f}_\mathrm{R0}|\sim10^{-7}$ should be possible.",1

4596,2,"Majorana zero mode in the vortex of an artificial topological superconductor Majorana fermion (MF), an exotic particle that is identical to its own antiparticle, was recently found in solid matter as a quasiparticle excitation, the Majorana zero mode (MZM), in the vortex of an artificial topological superconductor (TSC). This artificial TSC, first proposed by Fu and Kane in 2008, is a heterostructure made of a topological insulator Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ and an s-wave superconductor NbSe$_{2}$. This paper will briefly review the experimental progresses based on the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/NbSe$_{2}$ heterostructure. All evidences are self-consistent and reveal that the MZM exists in the center of vortex. Those experimental results are also supported by theory.

4603,2,"Starburst galaxies as seen by gamma-ray telescopes Starburst galaxies have a highly increased star-formation rate compared to regular galaxies and inject huge amounts of kinetic power into the interstellar medium via supersonic stellar winds, and supernova explosions. Supernova remnants, which are considered to be the main source of cosmic rays (CRs), form an additional, significant energy and pressure component and might influence the star-formation process in a major way. Observations of starburst galaxies at γ -ray energies give us the unique opportunity to study non-thermal phenomena associated with hadronic CRs and their relation to the star-formation process. In this work, recent observations of starburst galaxies with space and ground-based γ -ray telescopes are being reviewed, and the current state of theoretical work on the γ -ray emission is discussed.

4774,2,"Kinematic model-independent reconstruction of Palatini $f(R)$ cosmology A kinematic treatment to trace out the form of $f(R)$ cosmology, within the Palatini formalism, is discussed by only postulating the universe homogeneity and isotropy. To figure this out we build model-independent approximations of the luminosity distance through rational expansions. These approximants extend the Taylor convergence radii computed for usual cosmographic series. We thus consider both Pad\'e and the rational Chebyshev polynomials. They can be used to accurately describe the universe late-time expansion history, providing further information on the thermal properties of all effective cosmic fluids entering the energy momentum tensor of Palatini's gravity. To perform our numerical analysis, we relate the Palatini's Ricci scalar with the Hubble parameter $H$ and thus we write down a single differential equation in terms of the redshift $z$. Therefore, to bound $f(R)$, we make use of the most recent outcomes over the cosmographic parameters obtained from combined data surveys. In particular our clue is to select two scenarios, i.e. $(2,2)$ Pad\'e and $(2,1)$ Chebyshev approximations, since they well approximate the luminosity distance at the lowest possible order. We find that best analytical matches to the numerical solutions lead to $f(R)=a+bR^n$ with free parameters given by the set $(a, b, n)=(-3.866, 0.814, 1.073)$ for $(2,2)$ Pad\'e approximation, whereas $f(R)=\alpha+\beta R^m$ with $(\alpha, \beta, m)=(-3.158, 0.672, 1.124)$ for $(2,1)$ rational Chebyshev approximation. Finally, our results are compared with the $\Lambda$CDM predictions and with previous studies in the literature. Slight departures from General Relativity are also discussed.",1

5019,2,"Distinguishing Standard from Modified Gravity in the Local Group and beyond The works in this portfolio test the hypothesis that it is not possible to extrapolate the Newtonian inverse square law of gravity from Solar System to galaxy scales. In particular, I look into various tests of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which posits a modification below a very low acceleration threshold. Although discrepancies with Newtonian dynamics are indeed observed, they can usually be explained by invoking an appropriate distribution of invisible mass known as dark matter (DM). This leads to the standard cosmological paradigm, $\Lambda$CDM. I consider how it may be distinguished from MOND using collision velocities of galaxy clusters, which should sometimes be much faster in MOND. I focus on measuring these velocities more accurately and conclude that this test ought to be feasible in the near future. For the time being, I look at the much nearer and more accurately observed Local Group (LG) of galaxies. Its main constituents $-$ the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) $-$ should have undergone a past close flyby in MOND but not in $\Lambda$CDM. The fast MW-M31 relative motion around the time of their flyby would have allowed them to gravitationally slingshot any passing LG dwarf galaxies out at high speed. I consider whether there is any evidence for such high-velocity galaxies (HVGs). Several candidates are found in two different $\Lambda$CDM models of the LG, one written by a founding figure of the paradigm. The properties of these HVGs are similar to what might be expected in MOND, especially their tendency to lie close to a plane. Being more confident of its validity, I then used MOND to determine the escape velocity curve of the MW over the distance range 8$-$50 kpc, finding reasonable agreement with the latest observations. I finish by discussing possible future directions for MOND research.",1

5092,2,"Effective field theory and the scattering process for magnons in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets We discuss that a low-energy effective Lagrangian relying on SO(3) → SO(2) is applicable for a ferrimagnet as well as a ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet. We derive the Hamiltonian from the Lagrangian using the Poisson and Dirac brackets, and determine the particle states. The analysis of the particle states shows that there exist not only massless modes with the dispersion relations ω∝|k|,|k|2, i.e., the so-called type-I and type-II Nambu–Goldstone modes, respectively, but also gapped modes with ω∝m2+|k|2. We clarify how the coefficients of the terms with one time derivative and those with two time derivatives in the effective Lagrangian determine the order parameters specifying whether the system is in a ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or ferrimagnetic state; we stress that the gapped mode resulting form the spontaneous symmetry breaking appears only in the ferrimagnetic system and not in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. We also establish the power-counting scheme and calculate the scattering amplitudes and thereby the scattering lengths between the two Nambu–Goldstone bosons. We show that the scattering length of the gapped mode is finite and proportional to the gap. This characteristic property of the gapped NG mode can be used to discriminate it from gapped excitations that originate in other mechanisms. Finally, we study the effects of the explicit symmetry breaking that are given by an external magnetic field and a single-ion anisotropy, and show that the external magnetic fields do not have any effects on the scattering amplitudes in all the spin systems, as was known for the ferromagnet system. In contrast, the anisotropy does affect the scattering amplitudes, the phase shift, and the scattering length except for spin 1/2 systems. This result supports the possibility of the Efimov effect in spin systems discussed in previous studies.",1
5098,2,"Optimized operation of dielectric laser accelerators: Single bunch We introduce a general approach to determine the optimal charge, efficiency and gradient for laser driven accelerators in a self-consistent way. We propose a way to enhance the operational gradient of dielectric laser accelerators by leverage of beam-loading effect. While the latter may be detrimental from the perspective of the effective gradient experienced by the particles, it can be beneficial as the effective field experienced by the accelerating structure, is weaker. As a result, the constraint imposed by the damage threshold fluence is accordingly weakened and our self-consistent approach predicts permissible gradients of ∼10  GV/m, one order of magnitude higher than previously reported experimental results—with unbunched pulse of electrons. Our approach leads to maximum efficiency to occur for higher gradients as compared with a scenario in which the beam-loading effect on the material is ignored. In any case, maximum gradient does not occur for the same conditions that maximum efficiency does—a trade-off set of parameters is suggested.",1

5220,2,"Investigation of the RF efficiency of inductively coupled hydrogen plasmas at 1 MHz The power requirements of RF heated sources for negative hydrogen ions in fusion are substantial, which poses strong demands on the generators and components of the RF circuit. Consequently, an increase of the RF coupling efficiency would be highly beneficial. Fundamental investigations of the RF efficiency in inductively coupled hydrogen and deuterium discharges in cylindrical symmetry are conducted at the lab experiment CHARLIE. The experiment is equipped with several diagnostics including optical emission spectroscopy and a movable floating double probe to monitor the plasma parameters. The presented investigations are performed in hydrogen at a varying pressure between 0.3 and 10 Pa, utilizing a conventional helical ICP coil driven at a frequency of 1 MHz and a fixed power of 520 W for plasma generation. The coupling efficiency is strongly affected by the variation in pressure, reaching up to 85 % between 1 and 3 Pa while dropping down to only 50 % at 0.3 Pa, which is the relevant operating pressure for negative hydrogen ion sources for fusion. Due to the lower power coupling, also the measured electron density at 0.3 Pa is only 5 · 1016 m−3, while it reaches up to 2.5 · 1017 m−3 with increasing coupling efficiency. In order to gain information on the spatially resolved aspects of RF coupling and plasma heating which are not diagnostically accessible, first simulations of the discharge by an electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell Monte Carlo collision method have been conducted and are compared to the measurement data. At 1 Pa, the simulated data corresponds well to the results of both axially resolved probe measurements and radially resolved emission profiles obtained via OES.

This is an issue that has been in debate since Weyl formulated his unified field theory for the first time. We do not present the discussion from the point of view of a particular unification theory, but instead from a more general standpoint, in which the viability of such a structure as a model of space–time is investigated. Our starting point is the well known axiomatic approach to space–time given by Elhers, Pirani and Schild (EPS). In this framework, we carry out an exhaustive analysis of what is required for a consistent definition for proper time and show that such a definition leads to the prediction of the so-called “second clock effect”. We take the view that if, based on experience, we were to reject space–time models predicting this effect, this could be incorporated as the last axiom in the EPS approach. Finally, we provide a proof that, in this case, we are led to a Weyl integrable space–time as the most general structure that would be suitable to model space–time.",1

5477,2,"Effective-one-body waveforms for binary neutron stars using surrogate models Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can provide information about the masses, spins, and structure of neutron stars. However, this requires accurate and computationally efficient waveform models that take ≲1  s to evaluate for use in Bayesian parameter estimation codes that perform 107–108 waveform evaluations. We present a surrogate model of a nonspinning effective-one-body waveform model with ℓ=2, 3, and 4 tidal multipole moments that reproduces waveforms of binary neutron star numerical simulations up to merger. The surrogate is built from compact sets of effective-one-body waveform amplitude and phase data that each form a reduced basis. We find that 12 amplitude and 7 phase basis elements are sufficient to reconstruct any binary neutron star waveform with a starting frequency of 10 Hz. The surrogate has maximum errors of 3.8% in amplitude (0.04% excluding the last 100M before merger) and 0.043 rad in phase. This leads to typical mismatches of 10-5−10-4 for Advanced LIGO depending on the component masses, with a worst case match of 7×10-4 when both stars have masses ≥2  M⊙. The version implemented in the LIGO Algorithm Library takes ∼0.07  s to evaluate for a starting frequency of 30 Hz and ∼0.8  s for a starting frequency of 10 Hz, resulting in a speed-up factor of O(103) relative to the original matlab code. This allows parameter estimation codes to run in days to weeks rather than years, and we demonstrate this with a nested sampling run that recovers the masses and tidal parameters of a simulated binary neutron star system.",1
5538,2,"Quantum cloning and teleportation fidelity in the noncommutative phase-space The formulation of the no-cloning theorem in the framework of phase-space noncommutative (NC) quantum mechanics (QM) is examined, and its implications for the computation of quantum cloning probabilities and teleportation fidelity are investigated through the Weyl-Wigner formulation of QM. The principles of QM re-edited in terms of a deformed Heisenberg-Weyl algebra are shown to provide a covariant formulation for the quantum fidelity, through which the results from the no-cloning theorem for the ordinary QM can be reproduced. Besides exhibiting an explicit correspondence between standard and NC QM for Gaussian Wigner functions, our results suggest a feasible interpretation for the NC continuous variable quantum cloning given in terms of quantum teleportation protocols.",1
5558,2,"A hybrid approach for generating ultra-short bunches for advanced accelerator applications Generation of electron beams with high phase-space density, short bunch length and high peak current is an essential requirement for future linear colliders and bright electron beam sources. Unfortunately, such bunches cannot be produced directly from the source since forces from the mutual repulsion of electrons would destroy the brilliance of the beam within a short distance. Here, we detail a beam dynamics study of a two-stage compression scheme that can generate ultra-short bunches without degrading the beam quality. In the first stage, a magnetized beam is compressed with a velocity bunching technique in which the longitudinal phase space is rotated so that electrons on the bunch tail become faster than electrons in the bunch head. In the second stage, the beam is further compressed with a magnetic chicane. With the aid of numerical simulations we show that our two-staged scheme is capable to increase the current of a 50 pC bunch by a notable factor of 100 (from 15 A to 1.5 kA) while the emittance growth can be suppressed to 1% with appropriate tailoring of the initial beam distribution.",1
5577,2,"Phase diagram of electronic systems with quadratic Fermi nodes in $2 < d < 4$: $2+\epsilon$ expansion, $4-\epsilon$ expansion, and functional renormalization group Several materials in the regime of strong spin-orbit interaction such as HgTe, the pyrochlore iridate Pr2Ir2O7, and the half-Heusler compound LaPtBi, as well as various systems related to these three prototype materials, are believed to host a quadratic band touching point at the Fermi level. Recently, it has been proposed that such a three-dimensional gapless state is unstable to a Mott-insulating ground state at low temperatures when the number of band touching points N at the Fermi level is smaller than a certain critical number Nc. We further substantiate and quantify this scenario by various approaches. Using ε expansion near two spatial dimensions, we show that Nc=64/(25ε2)+O(1/ε) and demonstrate that the instability for N<Nc is towards a nematic ground state that can be understood as if the system were under (dynamically generated) uniaxial strain. We also propose a truncation of the functional renormalization group equations in the dynamical bosonization scheme which we show to agree to one-loop order with the results from ε expansion both near two as well as near four dimensions, and which smoothly interpolates between these two perturbatively accessible limits for general 2<d<4. Directly in d=3 we therewith find Nc=1.86, and thus again above the physical N=1. All these results are consistent with the prediction that the interacting ground state of pure, unstrained HgTe, and possibly also Pr2Ir2O7, is a strong topological insulator with a dynamically generated gap—a topological Mott insulator.",1
5584,2,"Detailed Studies of Light Transport in Optical Components of Particle Detectors Scintillator- and ﬁbre-based particle detectors are an indispensable tool in high-energy par-
ticle physics, medical physics and other ﬁelds of application. The potentially very low light
yield, down to a few photons, of the optical detector components in combination with the
inevitable light transport to photodetectors necessitate an optimal design and detailed un-
derstanding of such detectors. Thus, very detailed simulations are needed, which require
a very accurate modelling of the optical physics (optics, scintillation, wavelength-shifting
eﬀects,...), of the optical material properties, and of the optical components. To allow for
a reliable usage also by less experienced users, the necessary complexity and ﬂexibility of
a suitable simulation framework must not lead to an increasing danger of user mistakes.
Additionally, the required eﬀort for creating or modifying a detailed simulation has to be
minimised in order to allow for the fast creation of ﬂexible simulation setups.

In the scope of this thesis, these challenges have been addressed by developing the general
simulation framework GODDeSS. It is an extension of the particle-physics simulation tool
Geant4 and allows for the easy simulation of optical detector components, especially com-
binations of scintillators, optical ﬁbres, and photodetectors. To achieve this, the creation of
simulated setups is automated as much as possible: The material properties of the optical
detector components are speciﬁed via easy-to-read text ﬁles and new object classes allow
for an easy creation of scintillator tiles, optical ﬁbres, reﬂective wrappings and paints, and
photodetectors with basically a single line of code per created object. This results in an
increase of ﬂexibility and at the same time in a reduction of complexity. The user can create
extensive setups within a few lines of code and typical mistakes are avoided, as the pecu-
liarities of Geant4 regarding the conﬁguration of the optical physics processes are treated
automatically by the GODDeSS framework. All this makes GODDeSS an excellent approach
to simplify the detailed simulations of optical detector components, which are necessary for
designing modern particle detectors and for understanding their response.
This thesis introduces the GODDeSS framework, its classes, and its functionality. Further-
more, the extensive eﬀorts to validate it against manufacturer data as well as against test
measurements with prototype setups will be presented. Additionally, detailed simulations
have been performed in order to investigate the optical properties of optical ﬁbres and of the
characteristics of the response of detector modules.",1
5621,2,"Fabrication and cold test of dielectric assist accelerating structure We present the detailed description of a successful design and cold testing of the dielectric assist accelerating (DAA) structure. The DAA structure consists of ultralow-loss dielectric cylinders and disks with irises which are periodically arranged in a metallic enclosure. The advantage of the DAA structure is that it has an extremely high quality factor and a very high shunt impedance at room temperature since the electromagnetic field distribution of accelerating mode can be controlled by dielectric parts so that the wall loss on the metallic surface is greatly reduced. A prototype of the five-cell DAA structure was designed and built at C-band (5.712 GHz), and cold tested. Three types of dielectric cell structure, “regular,” “end,” and “hybrid” dielectric cells, are fabricated by sintering high-purity magnesia. The prototype was assembled by stacking these cells in the hollow copper cylinder, whose two ends are closed by copper plates. The resonant frequency of the prototype was tuned to the desired frequency by machining only end copper plates. The unloaded quality factor of the accelerating mode was measured at 119,314 and the shunt impedance per unit length of the prototype was estimated from the experimental results of the bead pull measurement as Zsh=617  MΩ/m, which were within 2 percent of the design values. The field distribution of accelerating mode was also measured by the bead pull method, and its results agreed well with simulation results.",1

5726,2,"Many-Body Quantum Interference and the Saturation of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) have been proposed as sensitive probes for chaos in interacting quantum systems. They exhibit a characteristic classical exponential growth, but saturate beyond the so-called scrambling or Ehrenfest time $\tau_{\rm E}$ in the quantum correlated regime. Here we present a path-integral approach for the entire time evolution of OTOCs for bosonic $N$-particle systems. We first show how the growth of OTOCs up to $\tau_{\rm E} = (1/\lambda) \log N$ is related to the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ of the corresponding chaotic mean-field dynamics in the semiclassical large-$N$ limit. Beyond $\tau_{\rm E}$, where simple mean-field approaches break down, we identify the underlying quantum mechanism responsible for the saturation. To this end we express OTOCs by coherent sums over contributions from different mean-field solutions and compute the dominant many-body interference term amongst them. Our method further applies to the complementary semiclassical limit $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ for fixed $N$, including quantum-chaotic single- and few-particle systems.",1
5795,2,"Channeling and radiation experiments at SLAC Over the last years, a SLAC-Aarhus-Ferrara-CalPoly collaboration (augmented by members of ANL and MIT) has performed channeling experiments using bent silicon crystals at the SLAC End Station A Test Beam as well as the FACET accelerator test facility. These experiments have revealed a remarkable channeling efficiency of about 24% under our conditions, as well as shown the dechanneling rate to be independent of the beam energy; an unexpected result. Volume reflection appears to be even more efficient with almost the whole beam taking part in the reflection process. In our most recent experiment we have attempted to measure the spectrum of channeling and volume-reflection gamma radiation. The goal of this series of experiments is to develop a crystalline undulator capable of producing narrow-band gamma rays with electron beams. Such a device could have applications in gamma-ray radiography as well as spectroscopic applications.",1
5891,2,"Ridge Waveguide HOM Damping Scheme for High Current SRF Cavity HOM damping is a challenge for high-current SRF linacs possibly generating HOM power at a level of 10 KW per cavity. A rectangular waveguide used as a natural high pass filter is a good option as high power, large spectrum HOM damper. However, its size is too big, causing a big challenge for the cooling and cryogenic system. A reliable, compact HOM damping scheme using a ridged waveguide is being developed to damp high power (&gt; 10 kW), large spectrum HOMs ( up to 40 GHz) that may be generated in the 647 MHz 5-cell eRHIC ERL SRF linac. The size of a ridged waveguide is less than a quarter of the regular waveguide, which alleviates the thermal issue. This paper presents the design of a ridged waveguide and estimated HOM damping results using a ridged waveguide. The thermal or cooling design of the ridged waveguide will also be addressed.",1
5921,2,"$\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Lie symmetries of the Lévy-Leblond equations The ${\mathbb Z}$ first-order differential Lévy-Leblond equations (LLEs) are the non-relativistic analogs of the Dirac equation, being square roots of ($1+d$)-dimensional Schrödinger or heat equations. Just like the Dirac equation, the LLEs possess a natural supersymmetry. In previous works it was shown that non-supersymmetric partial differential equations (notably the Schrödinger equations for free particles or in the presence of a harmonic potential), admit a natural ${\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie symmetry. In this paper we show that, for a certain class of supersymmetric partial differential equation, a natural ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie symmetry appears. In particular, we exhaustively investigate the symmetries of the $(1+1)$-dimensional Lévy-Leblond equations, both in the free case and for the harmonic potential. In the free case a ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie superalgebra, realized by first- and second-order differential symmetry operators, is found. In the presence of a non-vanishing quadratic potential, the Schrödinger invariance is maintained, while the ${\mathbb Z}_2$- and ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded extensions are no longer allowed. The construction of the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie symmetry of the ($1+2$)-dimensional free heat LLE introduces a new feature, explaining the existence of first-order differential symmetry operators not entering the super Schrödinger algebra.",1

The quasichanneling oscillations were observed at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory by aiming 20.35 GeV positrons and electrons at a thin silicon crystal bent to a radius of R=0.15  m, exploiting the quasimosaic effect.

6197,2,"Information transport in classical statistical systems For “static memory materials” the bulk properties depend on boundary conditions. Such materials can be realized by classical statistical systems which admit no unique equilibrium state. We describe the propagation of information from the boundary to the bulk by classical wave functions. The dependence of wave functions on the location of hypersurfaces in the bulk is governed by a linear evolution equation that can be viewed as a generalized Schrödinger equation. Classical wave functions obey the superposition principle, with local probabilities realized as bilinears of wave functions. For static memory materials the evolution within a subsector is unitary, as characteristic for the time evolution in quantum mechanics. The space-dependence in static memory materials can be used as an analogue representation of the time evolution in quantum mechanics – such materials are “quantum simulators”. For example, an asymmetric Ising model on a Euclidean two-dimensional lattice represents the time evolution of free relativistic fermions in two-dimensional Minkowski space.",1

The broad velocity spectrum of the assumed constituents makes it difficult at this stage to identify the origin of the stream(s) or the nature of its constituents.",1
6271,2,"Partial time-reversal transformation and entanglement negativity in fermionic systems The partial transpose of density matrices in many-body quantum systems, in which one takes the transpose only for a subsystem of the full Hilbert space, has been recognized as a useful tool to diagnose quantum entanglement. It can be used, for example, to define the (logarithmic) negativity. For fermionic systems, it has been known that the partial transpose of Gaussian fermionic density matrices is not Gaussian. In this work, we propose to use partial time-reversal transformation to define (an analog of) the entanglement negativity and related quantities. We demonstrate, for the symmetry-protected topological phase realized in the Kitaev chain, the conventional definition of the partial transpose (and hence the entanglement negativity) fails to capture the formation of the edge Majorana fermions, while the partial time reversal computes the quantum dimension of the Majorana fermions. Furthermore, we show that the partial time reversal of fermionic density matrices is Gaussian and can be computed efficiently. Various results (both numerical and analytical) for the entanglement negativity using the partial time reversal are presented for (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories, and also for fermionic disordered systems (random single phases).",1

In this presentation for the IUPAP Young Scientist Prize 2016, I would like to introduce the microscopic studies on nuclear spin-isospin properties in the framework of covariant density functional theory (DFT), by taking a few works that I have been joining in as examples. It is seen that the covariant scheme plays an important role in describing the spin properties in a consistent way, such as the spin-orbit splitting, the pseudospin symmetry, etc. Meanwhile, the Fock terms play important roles in describing the isospin properties fully self-consistently, such as the Gamow-Teller and spin-dipole resonances, the isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections to nuclear superallowed $\beta$ transitions, etc. To connect the covariant DFT to more fundamental theories, an \textit{ab initio} relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory for finite nuclei is introduced, and a personal perspective for the coming decade is also illustrated.",1
6518,2,"Curve counting on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds via derived categories We prove the elliptic transformation law of Jacobi forms for the generating series of Pandharipande--Thomas invariants of an elliptic Calabi--Yau 3-fold over a reduced class in the base. This proves part of a conjecture by Huang, Katz, and Klemm. For the proof we construct an involution of the derived category and use wall-crossing methods. We express the generating series of PT invariants in terms of low genus Gromov--Witten invariants and universal Jacobi forms. As applications we prove new formulas and recover several known formulas for the PT invariants of $\mathrm{K3} \times E$, abelian 3-folds, and the STU-model. We prove that the generating series of curve counting invariants for $\mathrm{K3} \times E$ with respect to a primitive class on the $\mathrm{K3}$ is a quasi-Jacobi form of weight -10. This provides strong evidence for the Igusa cusp form conjecture.",1
6523,2,"Neutron Star Mass Distribution in Binaries Massive neutron stars with ∼ 2M(ʘ) have been observed in neutron star-white dwarf binaries. On the other hand, well-measured neutron star masses in double-neutron-star binaries are still consistent with the limit of 1.5M(ʘ). These observations raised questions on the neutron star equations of state and the neutron star binary evolution processes. In this presentation, a hypothesis of super-Eddington accretion and its implications are discussed. We argue that a 2M(ʘ) neutron star is an outcome of the super-Eddington accretion during the evolution of neutron star-white dwarf binary progenitors. We also suggest the possibility of the existence of new type of neutron star binary which consists of a typical neutron star and a massive compact companion (high-mass neutron star or black hole) with M ≥ 2M(ʘ).",1
6534,2,"Phase Structure of XX0 Spin Chain and Nonintersecting Brownian Motion We study finite size and temperature XX0 Heisenberg spin chain in weak and strong coupling regimes. By using an elegant connection of the model to integrable combinatorics and probability, we explore and interpret a possible phase structure of the model in asymptotic limit: the limit of large inverse temperature and size. First, the partition function and free energy of the model are derived by using techniques and results from random matrix models and nonintersecting Brownian motion. We show that, in the asymptotic limit, partition function of the model, written in terms of matrix integral, is governed by the Tracy–Widom distribution. Second, the exact analytic results for the free energy, which is obtained by the asymptotic analysis of the Tracy–Widom distribution, indicate a completely new and sophisticated phase structure of the model. This phase structure consists of second- and third-order phase transitions. Finally, to shed light on our new results, we provide a possible new interpretation of the phase structure in terms of dynamical behaviour of magnons in the spin chain. We demonstrate distinct features of the phases with schematic spin configurations which have definite features in each region of the phase diagram.",1

While directly applicable to modern FEL facilities, this approach also provides opportunities for expanding existing beam delivery systems with additional experimental areas simultaneously feeding multiple beamlines. We derive the formalism for cascading RFDs by adopting the proper choice of deflector frequencies which can generate a large variety of beam switch yard topologies.

Rev. A 58, R1653 (1998)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.58.R1653]. We used this model to evaluate the energy loss of protons and antiprotons in ten solid targets: Cr, C, Ni, Be, Ti, Si, Al, Ge, Pb, Li, and Rb. They were chosen as canonicals because they have reliable Wigner-Seitz radius, rs=1.48 to 5.31, which cover most of the possible metallic solids. Present low-velocity results agree well with the experimental data for both proton and antiproton impact. Our formalism describes the binary collision of the projectile and one electron of the free-electron gas. It does not include the collective or plasmon excitations, which are important in the intermediate- and high-velocity regime. The distinguishing feature of this contribution is that by using the present model for low to intermediate energies and the Lindhard dielectric formalism for intermediate to high energies, we describe the stopping due to free-electron gas in an extensive energy range. Moreover, by adding the inner-shell contribution using the shellwise local plasma approximation, we are able to describe all the available experimental data in the low-, intermediate-, and high-energy regions.",1
6746,2,"CMB-lensing beyond the Born approximation We investigate the weak lensing corrections to the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies considering effects beyond the Born approximation. To this aim, we use the small deflection angle approximation, to connect the lensed and unlensed power spectra, via expressions for the deflection angles up to third order in the gravitational potential. While the small deflection angle approximation has the drawback to be reliable only for multipoles ℓ lesssim 2500, it allows us to consistently take into account the non-Gaussian nature of cosmological perturbation theory beyond the linear level. The contribution to the lensed temperature power spectrum coming from the non-Gaussian nature of the deflection angle at higher order is a new effect which has not been taken into account in the literature so far. It turns out to be the leading contribution among the post-Born lensing corrections. On the other hand, the effect is smaller than corrections coming from non-linearities in the matter power spectrum, and its imprint on CMB lensing is too small to be seen in present experiments.",1

The PT -symmetry remains spontaneously unbroken (i.e., the spectrum of the bound-state energies remains real so that the unitary-evolution stability of the quantum system in question is shown guaranteed) in a non-empty domain D(physical) of parameters x,y,z . The construction of the exceptional-point (EP) boundary ∂D(physical) of the physical domain is preformed using an innovative non-numerical implicit-function-construction strategy. The topology of the resulting EP boundary of the spontaneous PT -symmetry breakdown (i.e., of the physical “horizon of stability”) is shown similar to its much more elementary N=4 predecessor. Again, it is shown to consist of two components, viz., of the region of the quantum phase transitions of the first kind (during which at least some of the energies become complex) and of the quantum phase transitions of the second kind (during which some of the level pairs only cross but remain real).",1

7540,2,"The Linear Growth of Structure in the R_h=ct Universe We use recently published redshift space distortion measurements of the cosmological growth rate, fσ_8(z), to examine whether the linear evolution of perturbations in the R_h = ct cosmology is consistent with the observed development of large-scale structure. We find that these observations favour R_h = ct over the version of Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) optimized with the joint analysis of Planck and linear growth rate data, particularly in the redshift range 0 < z < 1, where a significant curvature in the functional form of fσ_8(z) predicted by the standard model—but not by R_h = ct—is absent in the data. When ΛCDM is optimized using solely the growth rate measurements; however, the two models fit the observations equally well though, in this case, the low-redshift measurements find a lower value for the fluctuation amplitude than is expected in Planck ΛCDM. Our results strongly affirm the need for more precise measurements of fσ_8(z) at all redshifts, but especially at z < 1.",1
7617,2,"Perspective on MOND emergence from Verlinde's ""emergent gravity"" and its recent test by weak lensing We highlight phenomenological aspects of Verlinde's recent proposal to account for the mass anomalies in galactic systems without dark matter -- in particular in their relation to MOND. Welcome addition to the MOND lore as it is, this approach have reproduced, so far, only a small fraction of MOND phenomenology, and is still rather tentative, both in its theoretical foundations and in its phenomenology. What Verlinde has extracted from this approach, so far, is a formula -- of rather limited applicability, and with no road to generalization in sight -- for the effective gravitational field of a spherical, isolated, static baryonic system. This formula cannot be used to calculate the gravitational field of disk galaxies, with their rich MOND phenomenology. Notably, it cannot predict their rotation curves, except asymptotically. It does not apply to the few-, or many-body problem; so, it cannot give, e.g., the two-body force between two galaxies, or be used to conduct N-body calculations of galaxy formation, evolution, and interactions. The formula cannot be applied to the internal dynamics of a system embedded in an external field, where MOND predicts important consequences. etc. MOND is backed by full-fledged, Lagrangian theories that can be, and are, routinely applied to all the above phenomena, and more. Verlinde's formula, as it now stands, strongly conflicts with solar-system and possibly earth-surface constraints, and cannot fully account for the mass anomalies in the cores of galaxy clusters (a standing conundrum in MOND). The recent weak-lensing test of the formula is, in fact, testing a cornerstone prediction of MOND, one that the formula does reproduce, and which has been tested before in the very same way.",1
7645,2,"Development of the Model of Galactic Interstellar Emission for Standard Point-Source Analysis of Fermi Large Area Telescope Data Most of the celestial γ rays detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope originate from the interstellar medium when energetic cosmic rays interact with interstellar nucleons and photons. Conventional point-source and extended-source studies rely on the modeling of this diffuse emission for accurate characterization. Here, we describe the development of the Galactic Interstellar Emission Model (GIEM), which is the standard adopted by the LAT Collaboration and is publicly available. This model is based on a linear combination of maps for interstellar gas column density in Galactocentric annuli and for the inverse-Compton emission produced in the Galaxy. In the GIEM, we also include large-scale structures like Loop I and the Fermi bubbles. The measured gas emissivity spectra confirm that the cosmic-ray proton density decreases with Galactocentric distance beyond 5 kpc from the Galactic Center. The measurements also suggest a softening of the proton spectrum with Galactocentric distance. We observe that the Fermi bubbles have boundaries with a shape similar to a catenary at latitudes below 20° and we observe an enhanced emission toward their base extending in the north and south Galactic directions and located within ∼4° of the Galactic Center.",1
7654,2,"Canonical metrics on holomorphic Courant algebroids Yau's solution of the Calabi Conjecture implies that every K\""ahler Calabi-Yau manifold $X$ admits a metric with holonomy contained in $\mathrm{SU}(n)$, and that these metrics are parametrized by the positive cone in $H^2(X,\mathbb{R})$. In this work we give evidence of an extension of Yau's theorem to non-K\""ahler manifolds, where $X$ is replaced by a compact complex manifold with vanishing first Chern class endowed with a holomorphic Courant algebroid. The equations that define our notion of 'best metric' are motivated by generalized geometry, and correspond to a mild generalization of the Hull-Strominger system.",1
7768,2,"Snapshot spectra in the world-line quantum Monte Carlo for one-dimensional quantum spin systems We introduce a snapshot density matrix and snapshot spectrum for world-line (WL) quantum Monte Carlo simulations, by integrating out the continuous-imaginary-time index of WL snapshots. For the transverse-field Ising chain, we reveal fundamental properties of the snapshot spectrum as follows. (i) In the ordered phase, the isolated peak corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue appears, indicating the classical nature of WL configurations. (ii) In the disordered phase, the spectrum converges to the dome-like distribution characterized by an effective aspect ratio of the snapshots. (iii) At the critical point, the power-law distribution is observed with an appropriate scaling analysis of the fixed aspect ratio. For the XXZ chain, we also obtain numerical results consistent with the above properties. In addition, the representation-basis dependence of the snapshot spectrum is also discussed.",1

We examine five specific models of f(T) gravity and obtained the valid range of their parameters.,1
7812,2,"FAIR Control Centre (FCC) - Concepts and Interim Options for the Existing GSI Main Control Room The 'Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research' (FAIR) which is presently under construction, extends and supersedes the existing GSI. Present operation still largely relies on laborious manual tuning based on analogue signals routed directly to the existing control room. The substantial scope increase from 3 to more than 8 FAIR accelerators requires more intricate and precise control across longer accelerator chains, while providing a high degree of multi-user operation, with facility reconfiguration required on time-scales of a few times per week. A new FAIR Control Centre (FCC) is being planned to accommodate the required larger accelerator crews as well as accelerator-based experiments. While targeting a single control room for up to ~35 people, emphasis is put on ergonomics, operational processes, and minimising unnecessary strain on personnel already during the design stage. This contribution presents digital control room concepts, console layout, and beam-production-chain paradigms aimed at achieving good operational performances and that influence the new FCC design.

7837,2,"Entanglement entropies of coupled harmonic oscillators We investigate the quantum entanglement of systems of coupled harmonic oscillators on the basis of thermo-field dynamics (TFD). For coupled harmonic oscillators at equilibrium, the extended entanglement entropy is derived using the TFD method, and it is demonstrated to be controlled by temperature and coupling parameters. For non-equilibrium systems, in addition to temperature and coupling parameters, the time dependence of the extended entanglement entropy is calculated in accordance with the dissipative von Neumann equation, and the dissipative dynamics of the systems of coupled harmonic oscillators is discussed. Consequently, based on TFD, the physical parametrization of the entanglement entropies is confirmed in both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases of harmonic oscillator systems by means of the laws of thermodynamics.",1
7861,2,"Fast Instability Caused by Electron Cloud in Combined Function Magnets One of the factors which may limit the intensity in the Fermilab Recycler is a fast transverse instability. It develops within a hundred turns and, in certain conditions, may lead to a beam loss. The high rate of the instability suggests that its cause is electron cloud. We studied the phenomena by observing the dynamics of stable and unstable beams, simulating numerically the buildup of the electron cloud, and developed an analytical model of an electron cloud driven instability with the electrons trapped in combined function dipoles. We found that beam motion can be stabilized by a clearing bunch, which confirms the electron cloud nature of the instability. The clearing suggest electron cloud trapping in Recycler combined function magnets. Numerical simulations show that up to 1% of the particles can be trapped by the magnetic field. Since the process of electron cloud buildup is exponential, once trapped this amount of electrons significantly increases the density of the cloud on the next revolution. In a Recycler combined function dipole this multiturn accumulation allows the electron cloud to reach final intensities orders of magnitude greater than in a pure dipole. The estimated resulting instability growth time of about 30 revolutions and the mode frequency of 0.4 MHz are consistent with experimental observations and agree with the simulation in the pei code. The created instability model allows investigating the beam stability for the future intensity upgrades.",1
7957,2,"On the spectrum of stable secondary nuclei in cosmic rays The ratio of the fluxes of secondary and primary nuclei in cosmic rays has long been used as an indicator of the grammage traversed in the journey of cosmic ray particles throughout the Galaxy. The basic idea is that primary particles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant shocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally interacting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce secondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically ≳100 GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of the main primary nucleus is found to scale as $$E_{{\rm k}}^{-\delta }$$, where E_k is the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and δ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The same shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the first place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided being above threshold for injection. The secondary nuclei produced by spallation in the interstellar medium are no exception, hence they also get accelerated. This effect is unavoidable, only its strength may be subject of debate. We compute the spectrum of secondary elements such as boron and lithium taking into account shock reacceleration and compare our predictions with the recent observations of the B/C ratio and preliminary measurements of the boron and lithium flux. Both these sets of data seem to confirm that reacceleration of secondary nuclei indeed plays an important role, thereby affecting the validity of those scaling rules that are often used in cosmic ray physics.",1
7978,2,"Ultralocal nature of geometrogenesis In this article we show that the ultralocal state of gravity can be associated with the so-called crumpled phase of gravity, observed e.g. in Causal Dynamical Triangulations. By considering anisotropic scaling present in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory, we prove that in the ultralocal scaling limit ($z \rightarrow 0$) the graph representing connectivity structure of space is becoming complete. In consequence, transition from the ultralocal phase ($z=0$) to the standard relativistic scaling ($z=1$) is implemented by the geometrogensis, similar to the one considered in Quantum Graphity approach. However, the relation holds only for the finite number of nodes $N$ and in the continuous limit ($N\rightarrow \infty$) the complete graph reduces to the set of disconnected points due to the weights $w=1/N$ associated with the links. By coupling Ising spin matter to the considered graph we show that the process of geometrogensis can be associated with critical behavior. Based on both analytical and numerical analysis phase diagram of the system is reconstructed showing that (for a ring graph) symmetry broken phase occurs at $z\in [0, 0.5)$. Finally, cosmological consequences of the considered process of geometrogenesis as well as similarities with the so-called synaptic pruning are briefly discussed.",1
8010,2,"Calculations of antiproton-nucleus quasi-bound states using the Paris $\bar{N}N$ potential An optical potential constructed using the p¯N scattering amplitudes derived from the 2009 version of the Paris N¯N potential is applied in calculations of p¯ quasi-bound states in selected nuclei across the periodic table. A proper self-consistent procedure for treating energy dependence of the amplitudes in a nucleus appears crucial for evaluating p¯ binding energies and widths. Particular attention is paid to the role of P -wave amplitudes. While the P -wave potential nearly does not affect calculated p¯ binding energies, it reduces considerably the corresponding widths. The Paris S -wave potential supplemented by a phenomenological P -wave term yields in dynamical calculations p¯ binding energies Bp¯≈200 MeV and widths Γp¯∼ 200–230 MeV, which is very close to the values obtained within the RMF model consistent with p¯ -atom data.",1

Moreover, these results give rise to black hole existence criteria which are meaningful even in the time-symmetric case, and also include certain boundary effects.",1
8129,2,"Dimensional regularization of the IR divergences in the Fokker action of point-particle binaries at the fourth post-Newtonian order The Fokker action of point-particle binaries at the fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) approximation of general relativity has been determined previously. However two ambiguity parameters associated with infrared (IR) divergencies of spatial integrals had to be introduced. These two parameters were fixed by comparison with gravitational self-force (GSF) calculations of the conserved energy and periastron advance for circular orbits in the test-mass limit. In the present paper together with a companion paper, we determine both these ambiguities from first principle, by means of dimensional regularization. Our computation is thus entirely defined within the dimensional regularization scheme, for treating at once the IR and ultra-violet (UV) divergencies. In particular, we obtain crucial contributions coming from the Einstein-Hilbert part of the action and from the nonlocal tail term in arbitrary dimensions, which resolve the ambiguities.",1

The oscillator is composed of Bose-condensed lithium atoms in the third band of an optical lattice, which have an energy-momentum relation nearly identical to that of a massive relativistic particle, with a reduced effective mass and speed of light. Imaging the shape of oscillator worldlines at velocities up to 98% of the effective speed of light reveals a crossover from sinusoidal to nearly photon-like propagation. Effective time dilation causes the measured period of oscillations to increase with energy; our measurements reveal beyond-leading-order contributions to this relativistic anharmonicity. Preparing oscillator ensembles, we observe an intrinsic relativistic dephasing and a breathing mode with exactly the opposite phase of that predicted for non-relativistic harmonic motion. All observed dynamics are in quantitative agreement with longstanding relativistic predictions.",1

Up to two conjectures, we show that V admits a unique holomorphic extension if r is a multiple of 8, and no holomorphic extension otherwise. This is implied by two results obtained in this paper: 1) If r is a multiple of 8, one possible holomorphic extension is given by the lattice vertex operator algebra for the even self dual lattice $D_r^+$ with shifted stress tensor. 2) We classify Lagrangian algebras in SF(h), a ribbon category associated to symplectic fermions. The classification of holomorphic extensions of V follows from 1) and 2) if one assumes that SF(h) is ribbon equivalent to Rep(V), and that simple modules of extensions of V are in one-to-one relation with simple local modules of the corresponding commutative algebra in SF(h).",1
8205,2,"Tight constraint on photon mass from pulsar spindown Pulsars are magnetized rotating compact objects. They spin down due to magnetic dipole radiation and wind emission. If a photon has nonzero mass, the spin-down rate will be lower than in the zero-mass case. We show that an upper limit of the photon mass, i.e., ${m}_{\gamma }\lesssim h/{{Pc}}^{2}$, may be placed if a pulsar with period P is observed to spin down. Recently, a white dwarf (WD)–M dwarf binary, AR Scorpii, was discovered to emit pulsed broadband emission. The spin-down luminosity of the WD can comfortably power non-thermal radiation from the system. Applying our results to the WD pulsar with P = 117 s, we obtain a stringent upper limit of the photon mass between ${m}_{\gamma }\lt 6.3\times {10}^{-50}\,{\rm{g}}$, assuming a vacuum dipole spindown, and ${m}_{\gamma }\lt 9.6\times {10}^{-50}\,{\rm{g}}$, assuming spindown due to a fully developed pulsar wind.",1

8278,2,"Field theoretical model of multilayered Josephson junction and dynamics of Josephson vortices Multilayered Josephson junctions are modeled in the context of a field theory, and dynamics of Josephson vortices trapped inside insulators are studied. Starting from a theory consisting of complex and real scalar fields coupled to a U(1) gauge field which admit parallel N−1 domain-wall solutions, Josephson couplings are introduced weakly between the complex scalar fields. The N−1 domain walls behave as insulators separating N superconductors, where one of the complex scalar fields has a gap. We construct the effective Lagrangian on the domain walls, which reduces to a coupled sine-Gordon model for well-separated walls and contains more interactions for walls at short distance. We then construct sine-Gordon solitons emerging in an effective theory in which we identify Josephson vortices carrying singly quantized magnetic fluxes. When two neighboring superconductors tend to have the same phase, the ground state does not change with the positions of domain walls (the width of superconductors). On the other hand, when two neighboring superconductors tend to have π-phase differences, the ground state has a phase transition depending on the positions of domain walls; when the two walls are close to each other (one superconductor is thin), frustration occurs because of the coupling between the two superconductors besides the thin superconductor. Focusing on the case of three superconductors separated by two insulators, we find for the former case that the interaction between two Josephson vortices on different insulators changes its nature, i.e., attractive or repulsive, depending on the positions of the domain walls. In the latter case, there emerges fractional Josephson vortices when two degenerate ground states appear due to spontaneous charge-symmetry breaking, and the number of the Josephson vortices varies with the position of the domain walls. Our predictions should be verified in multilayered Josephson junctions.",1
8279,2,Nonlinear Effects at the Fermilab Recycler e-Cloud Instability Theoretical analysis of e-cloud instability in the Fermilab Recycler is represented in the paper. The e-cloud in strong magnetic field is treated as a set of immovable snakes each being initiated by some proton bunch. It is shown that the instability arises because of injection errors of the bunches which increase in time and from bunch to bunch along the batch being amplified by the e-cloud electric field. The particular attention is given to nonlinear additions to the cloud field. It is shown that the nonlinearity is the main factor which restricts growth of the bunch amplitude. Possible role of the field free parts of the Recycler id discussed as well. Results of calculations are compared with experimental data demonstrating good correlation.,1

Once pointed out the absence of confinement for the front of the beam and the consequently divergence driven by the emittance, we study the evolution of the equilibrium configuration while propagating in the plasma, discarding all the others time-dependencies.

The metric is such that there is an initial big-bang type singularity and the final state depends on the chosen conformal factor. The Misner-Sharp mass is computed and a localized central object may be identified. The trapping horizons, geodesic and causal structure of the resulting spacetimes are investigated in detail. When a(t) asymptotes to a constant in a short enough time scale, the spacetime presents an event horizon and its analytical extension reveals black-hole or white-hole regions.

8703,2,"Spectral representations of normal operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces via intertwining quaternionic PVMs The possibility of formulating quantum mechanics over quaternionic Hilbert spaces can be traced back to von Neumann’s foundational works in the thirties. The absence of a suitable quaternionic version of spectrum prevented the full development of the theory. The first rigorous quaternionic formulation has started only in 2007 with the definition of the spherical spectrum of a quaternionic operator based on a quadratic version of resolvent operator. The relevance of this notion is proved by the existence of a quaternionic continuous functional calculus and a theory of quaternionic semigroups relying upon it. A problem of the quaternionic formulation is the description of composite quantum systems in the absence of a natural tensor product due to non-commutativity of quaternions. A promising tool towards a solution is a quaternionic projection-valued measure (PVM), making possible a tensor product of quaternionic operators with physical relevance. A notion with this property, called intertwining quaternionic PVM, is presented here. This foundational paper aims to investigate the interplay of this new mathematical object and the spherical spectral features of quaternionic generally unbounded normal operators. We discover, in particular, the existence of other spectral notions equivalent to the spherical ones, but based on a standard non-quadratic notion of resolvent operator.",1

Here we extend the above result in two directions; viz., to (a) the stationary axisymmteric spacetimes and (b) time-dependent cosmological spacetimes evolving asymptotically to the de Sitter or the Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetimes. While our calculations are exact for the stationary axisymmetric spacetimes, for the cosmological case we present an analytical expression of the entropy when the spacetime is close to the de Sitter or the Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime. Unlike the static spacetimes, there is no hypersurface orthogonal timelike Killing vector field in these cases. Nevertheless, the results hold, and the entropy develops an area dependence in the appropriate limit.",1
8823,2,"Nucleon Effective Masses in Neutron-Rich Matter Various kinds of isovector nucleon effective masses are used in the literature to characterize the momentum/energy dependence of the nucleon symmetry potential or self-energy due to the space/time non-locality of the underlying isovector strong interaction in neutron-rich nucleonic matter. The multifaceted studies on nucleon isovector effective masses are multi-disciplinary in nature. Besides structures, masses and low-lying excited states of nuclei as well as nuclear reactions, studies of the isospin dependence of short-range correlations in nuclei from scatterings of high-energy electrons and protons on heavy nuclei also help understand nucleon effective masses especially the so-called E-mass in neutron-rich matter. A thorough understanding of all kinds of nucleon effective masses has multiple impacts on many interesting issues in both nuclear physics and astrophysics. Indeed, essentially all microscopic many-body theories and phenomenological models with various nuclear forces available in the literature have been used to calculate single-nucleon potentials and the associated nucleon effective masses in neutron-rich matter. There are also fundamental principles connecting different aspects and impacts of isovector strong interactions. In particular, the Hugenholtz–Van Hove theorem connects analytically nuclear symmetry energy with both isoscalar and isovector nucleon effective masses as well as their own momentum dependences. It also reveals how the isospin-quartic term in the equation of state of neutron-rich matter depends on the high-order momentum-derivatives of both isoscalar and isovector nucleon potentials. The Migdal–Luttinger theorem facilitates the extraction of nucleon E-mass and its isospin dependence from experimentally constrained single-nucleon momentum distributions. The momentum/energy dependence of the symmetry potential and the corresponding neutron–proton effective mass splitting also affect transport properties and the liquid–gas phase transition in neutron-rich matter. Moreover, they influence the dynamics and isospin-sensitive observables of heavy-ion collisions through both the Vlasov term and the collision integrals of the Boltzmann–Uehling–Uhlenbeck transport equation. We review here some of the significant progresses made in recent years by the nuclear physics community in resolving some of the hotly debated and longstanding issues regarding nucleon effective masses especially in dense neutron-rich matter. We also point out some of the remaining key issues requiring further investigations in the era of high precision experiments using advanced rare isotope beams.",1

Analytical expressions for the locations of the principal foci and the focal lengths are obtained in the paraxial approximation in the models with uniform as well as nonuniform effective magnetic fields inside the lens. The results show that the left- and right-handed quasiparticles can be focused at different spatial locations when both magnetic and pseudomagnetic fields are applied. It is suggested that the use of magnetic and pseudomagnetic lenses could open new ways of producing and manipulating beams of chiral Weyl quasiparticles.,1
8896,2,"Geodesics and the magnitude-redshift relation on cosmologically symmetric Finsler spacetimes We discuss the geodesic motion of both massive test particles, following timelike geodesics, and light, following null geodesics, on Finsler spacetimes with cosmological symmetry. Using adapted coordinates on the tangent bundle of the spacetime manifold, we derive the general form of the geodesic equation. Further, we derive a complete set of constants of motion. As an application of these findings, we derive the magnitude-redshift relation for light propagating on a cosmologically symmetric Finsler background, both for a general Finsler spacetime and for particular examples, such as spacetimes equipped with Bogoslovsky and Randers length measures. Our results allow a confrontation of these geometries with observations of the magnitude and redshift of supernovae.",1
8898,2,"Performance analysis of superconducting rf cavities for the CERN rare isotope accelerator The first cryomodule of the new HIE-ISOLDE rare isotope accelerator has recently been commissioned with beam at CERN, with the second cryomodule ready for installation. Each cryomodule contains five superconducting low-beta quarter wave cavities, produced with the technology of sputtering a thin niobium film onto the copper substrate (Nb/Cu). This technology has several benefits compared to the bulk niobium solution, but also drawbacks among which the most relevant is the increase of surface resistance with accelerating field. Recent work has established the possible connection of this phenomenon to local defects in the Nb/Cu interface, which may lead to increased thermal impedance and thus local thermal runaway. We have analyzed the performance of the HIE-ISOLDE cavities series production, as well as of a few prototypes’, in terms of this model, and found a strong correlation between the rf properties and one of the model characteristic quantities, namely the total surface having increased interface thermal impedance.",1

It benefits from both the quick response of a time to digital converter and the versatility of a waveform digitizer to perform accurate timing measurements. Thanks to the sampled signals, smart algorithms making best use of the pulse shape can be used to improve time resolution. A software framework has been developed to analyse the SAMPIC output data and extract timing information by using either a constant fraction discriminator or a fast cross-correlation algorithm. SAMPIC timing capabilities together with the software framework have been tested using pulses generated by a signal generator or by a silicon detector illuminated by a pulsed infrared laser. Under these ideal experimental conditions, the SAMPIC chip has proven to be capable of timing resolutions down to 4 ps with synthesized signals and 40 ps with silicon detector signals.",1
9154,2,"Electron bunch profile reconstruction based on phase-constrained iterative algorithm The phase retrieval problem occurs in a number of areas in physics and is the subject of continuing investigation. The one-dimensional case, e.g., the reconstruction of the temporal profile of a charged particle bunch, is particularly challenging and important for particle accelerators. Accurate knowledge of the longitudinal (time) profile of the bunch is important in the context of linear colliders, wakefield accelerators and for the next generation of light sources, including x-ray SASE FELs. Frequently applied methods, e.g., minimal phase retrieval or other iterative algorithms, are reliable if the Blaschke phase contribution is negligible. This, however, is neither known a priori nor can it be assumed to apply to an arbitrary bunch profile. We present a novel approach which gives reproducible, most-probable and stable reconstructions for bunch profiles (both artificial and experimental) that would otherwise remain unresolved by the existing techniques.",1

The background metric considered here, is a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) space-time. A simple parametrization of the Hubble parameter $H$ is considered for a deterministic solution of the field equations. The cosmological dynamics is consistent with the current observations, and are discussed here in some detail for our obtained model. We have analyzed the time evolution of the physical parameters e.g. energy density, pressure, equation of state parameter and cosmological constant and obtained their bounds analytically. Moreover, the behaviour of these parameters are shown graphically in terms of redshift $z$ and their physical consequences are discussed. Also, the role of $f(R,T)$ coupling constant $\lambda$ is discussed in the evolution of equation of state parameter $\omega$ separately. We have performed the statefiner and Om diagnostic analysis to distinguish our obtained model with other dark energy models and also discussed the energy conditions.

9622,2,"Recovering the fundamental plane of galaxies by $f(R)$ gravity The fundamental plane (FP) of galaxies can be recovered in the framework of f(R) gravity avoiding the issues related to dark matter to fit the observations. In particular, the power-law version f(R)∝Rn , resulting from the existence of Noether symmetries for f(R) , is sufficient to implement the approach. In fact, relations between the FP parameters and the corrected Newtonian potential, coming from Rn , can be found and justified from a physical point of view. Specifically, we analyze the velocity distribution of elliptical galaxies and obtain that rc , the scale-length depending on the gravitational system properties, is proportional to re , the galaxy effective radius. This fact points out that the gravitational corrections induced by f(R) can lead photometry and dynamics of the system. Furthermore, the main byproduct of such an approach is that gravity could work in different ways depending on the scales of self-gravitating systems.",1

Lint = 19.5 fb−1
from proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of √
s = 8 TeV produced at
the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS experiment in 2012. The search is performed in the decay channel
with two tau leptons decaying hadronically, h/H/A → τhadτhad. The selection of events is based on the
kinematic and topological properties of a heavy neutral Higgs boson produced by bb¯ annihilation and the
gluon-gluon fusion production mechanisms.
The search significantly improves upon the sensitivity of previous searches, and leads the sensitivity of
the h/H/A → ττ combined search, where other tau decay modes are selected in the final state, for signal

As no significant excess is found, exclusion limits are set in the space of the two leading-order free

of mH = 125.09 ± 0.24 GeV, new phenomenological scenarios of the MSSM were proposed. In this
search, exclusion limits are obtained for these various scenarios in the mass range mA = 170 − 1000 GeV.

A resonance region with optimal constructive interference is given by a principal wavelength λ of the order of Bohr atom radius. Our study shows that the proton radius deviations can be measured. Moreover, in the case of the electron, its radius converges to electron classical radius with a value of 2.817 fm. Resonance waves afforded us the possibility to measure the proton and electron radii through an interference term. This term, was a necessary condition in order to have an effective cross section maximum at the threshold. The minimum entropy means minimum proton shape deformation and it was found to be (0.830 ± 0.015) fm and the average proton radius was found to be (0.825 − 0.0341; 0.888 + 0.0405) fm.",1

9647,2,"Coda reconstruction from cross-correlation of a diffuse field on thin elastic plates This study contributes to the evaluation of the robustness and accuracy of Green's function reconstruction from cross-correlation of strongly dispersed reverberated signals, with disentangling of the respective roles of ballistic and reverberated (“coda”) contributions. We conduct a suite of experiments on a highly reverberating thin duralumin plate, where an approximately diffuse flexural wave field is generated by taking advantage of the plate reverberation and wave dispersion. A large number of impulsive sources that cover the whole surface of the plate are used to validate ambient-noise theory through comparison of the causal and anticausal (i.e., positive- and negative-time) terms of the cross-correlation to one another and to the directly measured Green's function. To quantify the contribution of the ballistic and coda signals, the cross-correlation integral is defined over different time windows of variable length, and the accuracy of the reconstructed Green's function is studied as a function of the initial and end times of the integral. We show that even cross-correlations measured over limited time windows converge to a significant part of the Green's function. Convergence is achieved over a wide time window, which includes not only direct flexural-wave arrivals, but also the multiply reverberated coda. We propose a model, based on normal-mode analysis, that relates the similarity between the cross-correlation and the Green's function to the statistical properties of the plate. We also determine quantitatively how incoherent noise degrades the estimation of the Green's function.",1

9665,2,"Deuteron-induced nucleon transfer reactions within an ab initio framework: First application to p-shell nuclei Background: Low-energy transfer reactions in which a proton is stripped from a deuteron projectile and dropped into a target play a crucial role in the formation of nuclei in both primordial and stellar nucleosynthesis, as well as in the study of exotic nuclei using radioactive beam facilities and inverse kinematics. Ab initio approaches have been successfully applied to describe the H3(d,n)He4 and He3(d,p)He4 fusion processes. Purpose: An ab initio treatment of transfer reactions would also be desirable for heavier targets. In this work, we extend the ab initio description of (d,p) reactions to processes with light p-shell nuclei. As a first application, we study the elastic scattering of deuterium on Li7 and the Li7(d,p)Li8 transfer reaction based on a two-body Hamiltonian. Methods: We use the no-core shell model to compute the wave functions of the nuclei involved in the reaction, and describe the dynamics between targets and projectiles with the help of microscopic-cluster states in the spirit of the resonating group method. Results: The shapes of the excitation functions for deuterons impinging on Li7 are qualitatively reproduced up to the deuteron breakup energy. The interplay between d-Li7 and p-Li8 particle-decay channels determines some features of the Be9 spectrum above the d+Li7 threshold. Our prediction for the parity of the 17.298 MeV resonance is at odds with the experimental assignment. Conclusions: Deuteron stripping reactions with p-shell targets can now be computed ab initio, but calculations are very demanding. A quantitative description of the Li7(d,p)Li8 reaction will require further work to include the effect of three-nucleon forces and additional decay channels and to improve the convergence rate of our calculations.",1
9701,2,"Muon Tracing and Image Reconstruction Algorithms for Cosmic Ray Muon Computed Tomography Cosmic ray muon computed tomography ({\mu}CT) is a new imaging modality with unique characteristics that could be particularly important for diverse applications including nuclear nonproliferation, spent nuclear fuel monitoring, cargo scanning, and volcano imaging. The strong scattering dependence of muons on atomic number Z in combination with high penetration range could offer a significant advantage over existing techniques when dense, shielded containers must be imaged. However, {\mu}CT reconstruction using conventional filtered back-projection is limited due to the overly simple assumptions that do not take into account the effects of multiple Coulomb scattering prompting the need for more sophisticated approaches to be developed. In this paper, we argue that the use of improved muon tracing and scattering angle projection algorithms as well as use of an algebraic reconstruction technique should produce muon tomographic images with improved quality or require fewer muons to produce the same image quality compared to the case where conventional methods are used. We report on the development and assessment of three novel muon tracing methods and two new scattering angle projection methods for {\mu}CT. Simulated dry storage casks with single and partial missing fuel assemblies were used as numerical examples to assess and compare the proposed methods. The simulated images showed an expected improvement in image quality when compared with more conventional techniques, even without muon momentum information, which should lead to improved detection capability, even for partial defects.",1

9736,2,"Entanglement dynamics for uniformly accelerated two-level atoms coupled with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations We investigate the entanglement dynamics of two uniformly accelerated atoms with the same acceleration perpendicular to their separation. The two-atom system is treated as an open system coupled with fluctuating electromagnetic fields in the Minkowski vacuum, and in the Born–Markov approximation the master equation that describes the completely positive time evolution of the two-atom system is derived. In particular, we investigate the phenomena of entanglement degradation, generation, revival and enhancement. As opposed to the scalar-field case, the entanglement dynamics is crucially dependent on the polarization directions of the atoms. For the two-atom system with certain acceleration and separation, the polarization directions of the atoms may determine whether entanglement generation, revival or enhancement happens, while for entanglement degradation, they affect the decay rate of entanglement. A comparison between the entanglement evolution of accelerated atoms and that of static ones immersed in a thermal bath at the Unruh temperature shows that they are the same only when the acceleration is extremely small.",1

9782,2,"Production and Distribution of $^{44}$Ti and $^{56}$Ni in a Three-dimensional Supernova Model Resembling Cassiopeia A The spatial and velocity distributions of nuclear species synthesized in the innermost regions of core-collapse supernovae can yield important clues about explosion asymmetries and the operation of the still disputed explosion mechanism. Recent observations of radioactive (44)Ti with high-energy satellite telescopes (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array [NuSTAR], INTEGRAL) have measured gamma-ray line details, which provide direct evidence of large-scale explosion asymmetries in SN 1987A and in Cassiopeia A (Cas A) even by mapping of the spatial brightness distribution (NuSTAR). Here we discuss a 3D simulation of a neutrino-driven explosion, using a parameterized neutrino engine, whose (44)Ti distribution is mostly concentrated in one hemisphere pointing opposite to the neutron star (NS) kick velocity. Both exhibit intriguing resemblance to the observed morphology of the Cas A remnant, although neither the progenitor nor the explosion was fine-tuned for a perfect match. Our results demonstrate that the asymmetries observed in this remnant can, in principle, be accounted for by a neutrino-driven explosion, and that the high (44)Ti abundance in Cas A may be explained without invoking rapid rotation or a jet-driven explosion, because neutrino-driven explosions generically eject large amounts of high-entropy matter. The recoil acceleration of the NS is connected to mass ejection asymmetries and is opposite to the direction of the stronger explosion, fully compatible with the gravitational tugboat mechanism. Our results also imply that Cas A and SN 1987A could possess similarly “one-sided” Ti and Fe asymmetries, with the difference that Cas A is viewed from a direction with large inclination angle to the NS motion, whereas the NS in SN 1987A should have a dominant velocity component pointing toward us.",1

Since 2004 the program has been supported in part by DOE in the frame of an exchange agreement with INFN. In 2007 the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies (Pisa) established an agreement with Fermilab to share the cost of 4 engineering students each year. In the 34 years of its history, the program has involved approximately 500 Italian students from more than 20 Italian universities and from some European universities. In the years 2010-2017, with the support of INFN, INAF, ASI, ISSNAF and the Cultural Association of Italians at Fermilab (CAIF), 20 students were hosted in several other US laboratories and universities. The Fermilab training programs spanned from data analysis to design and construction of particle detectors and accelerator components, R/D on superconductive elements, theory of accelerators, analysis of astrophysical data. In 2015 the University of Pisa created an ad-hoc Summer School. Fermilab interns are enrolled at the University of Pisa for the duration of the internship. They are required to write summary reports published in the Fermilab and University of Pisa web pages.

The $g2$-space geometries of the models and data from the SPARC database are classified and compared in a rescaled $\hat{g}2$-space that reduces systematic uncertainties on galaxy distance, inclination angle and variations in mass to light ratios. We find that MOND modified inertia models, frequently used to fit rotation curve data, are disfavoured at more than 5$\sigma$ independent of model details. The Bekenstein-Milgrom formulation of MOND modified gravity compares better with data in the analytic approximation we use. However a quantitative comparison with data is beyond the scope of the paper due to this approximation. NFW DM profiles only agree with a minority of galactic rotation curves.

We calculate phase shifts in the neutron-proton system and proton-proton systems as well as the scattering length in the neutron-neutron system. We then perform a full next-to-next-to-leading order calculation with two-nucleon and three-nucleon forces for the triton and helium-4 and analyse their binding energy correlation. We show how the Tjon band is reached by decreasing the lattice spacing and confirm the continuum observation that a four-body force is not necessary to describe light nuclei.",1
10314,2,"Positronium laser excitation in the AE$\bar{g}$IS experiment The AEgIS experimental program on antimatter systems involves the formation of antihydrogen atoms for gravitational and CPT studies. One of the key ingredients of the AEgIS strategy for the synthesis of antihydrogen atoms is the creation and manipulation of Positronium (Ps) atoms laser excited to Rydberg states (n > 15). In AEgIS, Ps is produced in bunched mode and the Rydberg excitation is achieved with a two laser pulse technique, by passing through a n = 3 intermediate level. Because excitation on Ps n = 3 state has never been proposed before, in AEgIS a dedicated experimental apparatus and several detection strategies have been studied in order to observe the first measurement ever on this interesting process. In this work we present and discuss the experimental findings about the successful Ps n = 3 excitation. Moreover, in this thesis, a study of the impact of involved nonlinear processes on the excitation efficiency of a Doppler broadened atomic cloud is carried out. Presented simulation results show that, by exploiting properly nonlinear processes in the generation of the desired wavelength, it is possible to improve the excitation efficiency of a laser pulse. It is crucial, in AEgIS, the use of a periodically poled crystal in quasi phase matching regime. This gives a broadband continuous output spectrum whose wings survive to the spectral cutting of the last nonlinear crystal of the chain (which has insufficient spectral acceptance). This means that, at high laser energies, these wings can be amplified and the spectrum gaps can be filled in, leading to high reachable saturation efficiencies. On the contrary, in a laser pulse with a comb-shaped spectrum with a Gaussian envelope, both wings and gaps drop rapidly to zero, and amplification hardly occurs at usually employed energy regimes. The presented model is finally used to fit AEgIS Ps n = 3 excitation experimental data.",1

We have developed a new control system of a magnet power supply to work with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The control PLC handles the status of the interlock signals between a power supply and a magnet, and monitors the output voltage and the current. The PLC also controls a programmable reference voltage to regulate the output current. In addition, we have been developing an automatic orbit-correction program with the control system of the magnet power supply. The previous data of the beam profile monitors located on the upstream side of the beam dump and the temperature distribution on the beam dump show a possibility of the automatic correction of the beam orbit to the beam dump.

This paper reports the current status of the power supply control system which can automatically correct the horizontal beam position at the beam dump.",1

10821,2,"Optical Potentials Derived from Nucleon-Nucleon Chiral Potentials at N4LO Background: Elastic scattering is probably the main event in the interactions of nucleons with nuclei. Even if this process has been extensively studied in the past years, a consistent description, i.e., starting from microscopic two- and many-body forces connected by the same symmetries and principles, is still under development. Purpose: In a previous paper [M. Vorabbi, P. Finelli, and C. Giusti, Phys. Rev. C 93, 034619 (2016)2469-998510.1103/PhysRevC.93.034619] we derived a theoretical optical potential from NN chiral potentials at fourth order (N3LO). In the present work we use NN chiral potentials at fifth order (N4LO), with the purpose to check the convergence and to assess the theoretical errors associated with the truncation of the chiral expansion in the construction of an optical potential. Methods: Within the same framework and with the same approximations as the previous paper [M. Vorabbi, P. Finelli, and C. Giusti, Phys. Rev. C 93, 034619 (2016)2469-998510.1103/PhysRevC.93.034619], the optical potential is derived as the first-order term within the spectator expansion of the nonrelativistic multiple scattering theory and adopting the impulse approximation and the optimum factorization approximation. Results: The pp and np Wolfenstein amplitudes and the cross section, analyzing power, and spin rotation of elastic proton scattering from O16, C12, and Ca40 nuclei are presented at an incident proton energy of 200 MeV. The results obtained with different versions of chiral potentials at N4LO are compared. Conclusions: Our results indicate that convergence has been reached at N4LO. The agreement with the experimental data is comparable with the agreement obtained in the previous paper [M. Vorabbi, P. Finelli, and C. Giusti, Phys. Rev. C 93, 034619 (2016)2469-998510.1103/PhysRevC.93.034619].

10978,2,"Probing Intergalactic Magnetic Fields with Simulations of Electromagnetic Cascades We determine the effect of intergalactic magnetic fields on the distribution of high-energy gamma rays by performing three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of the development of gamma-ray-induced electromagnetic cascades in the magnetized intergalactic medium. We employ the so-called “Large Sphere Observer” method to efficiently simulate blazar gamma ray halos. We study magnetic fields with a Batchelor spectrum and with maximal left- and right-handed helicities. We also consider the case of sources whose jets are tilted with respect to the line of sight. We verify the formation of extended gamma ray halos around the source direction, and observe spiral-like patterns if the magnetic field is helical. We apply the Q-statistics to the simulated halos to extract their spiral nature and also propose an alternative method, the S-statistics. Both methods provide a quantitative way to infer the helicity of the intervening magnetic fields from the morphology of individual blazar halos for magnetic field strengths B≳10-15  G and magnetic coherence lengths Lc≳100  Mpc. We show that the S-statistics has a better performance than the Q-statistics when assessing magnetic helicity from the simulated halos.",1
11065,2,"Thermodynamics and the structure of quantum theory Despite its enormous empirical success, the formalism of quantum theory still raises fundamental questions: why is nature described in terms of complex Hilbert spaces, and what modifications of it could we reasonably expect to find in some regimes of physics? Here we address these questions by studying how compatibility with thermodynamics constrains the structure of quantum theory. We employ two postulates that any probabilistic theory with reasonable thermodynamic behaviour should arguably satisfy. In the framework of generalised probabilistic theories, we show that these postulates already imply important aspects of quantum theory, like self-duality and analogues of projective measurements, subspaces and eigenvalues. However, they may still admit a class of theories beyond quantum mechanics. Using a thought experiment by von Neumann, we show that these theories admit a consistent thermodynamic notion of entropy, and prove that the second law holds for projective measurements and mixing procedures. Furthermore, we study additional entropy-like quantities based on measurement probabilities and convex decomposition probabilities, and uncover a relation between one of these quantities and Sorkin’s notion of higher-order interference.",1
11223,2,"Anthropic Estimates for Many Parameters of Physics and Astronomy Anthropic arguments of Carter, Carr, and Rees give two approximate power-law relations between the elementary charge e, the mass of the proton m_p, and the mass of the electron m_e in Planck units: m_p ~ e^{18}, m_e ~ e^{21}. A renormalization group argument of mine gives e^{-2} ~ -(10/pi)ln{m_p}. Combining this with the Carter-Carr-Rees relations gives e^2 ln{e} ~ -pi/180. Taking the exact solutions of these approximate equations gives values for e, m_p, and m_e whose logarithms have relative errors only 0.7%, 1.3%, and 1.0% respectively, without using as input the observed values of any parameters with potentially continuous ranges. One can then get anthropic estimates for the masses, sizes, luminosities, times, velocities, etc. for many other structures in physics and astronomy, from atoms to giraffes to the universe, as simple powers of the anthropic estimate for the elementary charge. For example, one gets an anthropic estimate for the real part of the logarithm of the dark energy density with a relative error of only 0.2%.",1

11427,2,"Is a Topology Change After a Big Rip Possible? Motivated by condensed matter physical systems, in which a finite-time singularity indicates that the topology of the system changes, we critically examine the possibility of the Universe's topology change at a finite-time cosmological singularity. We emphasize on Big Rip and Type II and IV cosmological singularities, which we classify to future spacelike and timelike singularities. For the Type IV and Type II singularities, since no geodesics incompleteness occurs, no topological change is allowed, by using Geroch's theorem arguments. However, for the Big Rip case, Tipler's arguments allow a topology change, if the spacetime in which the topology change occurs is non-compact and the boundary of this region are two topologically distinct three dimensional spacelike partial Cauchy hypersurfaces. Also, some additional requirements must hold true, among which the weak energy condition, which can be satisfied in a geometric way in the context of a modified gravity. We critically examine Tipler's arguments for the Big Rip case, and we discuss the mathematical implications of such a topological change, with regard to the final hypersurface on which geodesics incompleteness occurs.",1
11505,2,"R\'enyi entropies of generic thermodynamic macrostates in integrable systems We study the behaviour of R\'enyi entropies in a generic thermodynamic macrostate of an integrable model. In the standard quench action approach to quench dynamics, the R\'enyi entropies may be derived from the overlaps of the initial state with Bethe eigenstates. These overlaps fix the driving term in the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) formalism. We show that this driving term can be also reconstructed starting from the macrostate's particle densities. We then compute explicitly the stationary R\'enyi entropies after the quench from the dimer and the tilted N\'eel state in XXZ spin chains. For the former state we employ the overlap TBA approach, while for the latter we reconstruct the driving terms from the macrostate. We discuss in full details the limits that can be analytically handled and we use numerical simulations to check our results against the large time limit of the entanglement entropies.",1

11610,2,"Hamiltonian formulation of systems with balanced loss–gain and exactly solvable models A Hamiltonian formulation of generic many-body systems with balanced loss and gain is presented. It is shown that a Hamiltonian formulation is possible only if the balancing of loss and gain terms occurs in a pairwise fashion. It is also shown that with the choice of a suitable co-ordinate, the Hamiltonian can always be reformulated in the background of a pseudo-Euclidean metric. If the equations of motion of some of the well-known many-body systems like Calogero models are generalized to include balanced loss and gain, it appears that the same may not be amenable to a Hamiltonian formulation. A few exactly solvable systems with balanced loss and gain, along with a set of integrals of motion are constructed. The examples include a coupled chain of nonlinear oscillators and a many-particle Calogero-type model with four-body inverse square plus two-body pair-wise harmonic interactions. For the case of nonlinear oscillators, stable solution exists even if the loss and gain parameter has unbounded upper range. Further, the range of the parameter for which the stable solutions are obtained is independent of the total number of the oscillators. The set of coupled nonlinear equations are solved exactly for the case when the values of all the constants of motions except the Hamiltonian are equal to zero. Exact, analytical classical solutions are presented for all the examples considered.",1
11736,2,"Cosmological signatures of fundamental physics This thesis deals with the study of the cosmological signatures of certain aspects of fundamental physics, and how cosmological observables can be used to constrain properties of fundamental
particles. Over the past decades, increasingly precise measurements in cosmology have become
powerful probes of fundamental physics - for example, the inference of dark matter and dark
energy from cosmological observations remain the most significant evidence of new physics beyond
the Standard Model of particle physics. Another example is the cosmological scalar-to-tensor ratio,
which can potentially differentiate different models of inflation and other early Universe theories.
Determining the absolute mass scale of neutrinos is an interesting problem in particle physics,
and can shed light on the mass generation mechanism for neutrinos, which, in turn, can tell us
about physics beyond the Standard Model. To fully exploit the signatures of massive neutrinos
on cosmological observables, one needs to perform accurate simulations. In this thesis, we explore
a new method for performing neutrino simulations, which overcome the shortcomings of previous
methods which were employed. From these simulations, we identify an observable which is very
sensitive to the neutrino mass - the clustering of cosmological voids on large scales. We also forecast how well the neutrino masses and thermal “dark radiation” models can be constrained in future cosmological surveys using their effect on various observables in these surveys, such as the clustering of galaxies, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear. Cosmological observables can also be used to constrain the properties of Dark Matter itself. While Dark Matter has traditionally been considered a collisionless fluid, there has been recent interest in self-interactions of dark matter. We consider a special form of self-interactions in this thesis - where the interactions are elastic but anisotropic. We develop the formalism and methods to simulate these interactions, and study the signatures of these interactions on the properties of dark matter halos.",1
11916,2,"Reconstruction of the remote dipole and quadrupole fields from the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich and polarized Sunyaev Zel'dovich effects The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) and polarized Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pSZ) effects are temperature and polarization anisotropies induced by the scattering of CMB photons from structure in the post-reionization Universe. In the case of the kSZ effect, small angular scale anisotropies in the optical depth are modulated by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole field, e.g. the CMB dipole observed at each spacetime point. In the case of the pSZ effect, similar small-scale anisotropies are modulated by the CMB quadrupole field, which receives contributions from both scalar and tensor modes. Statistical anisotropies in the cross correlations of CMB temperature and polarization with tracers of the inhomogeneous distribution of electrons provide a means of isolating and reconstructing the dipole and quadrupole fields. In this paper, we present a set of unbiased minimum variance quadratic estimators for the reconstruction of the dipole and quadrupole fields, and forecast the ability of future CMB experiments and large scale structure surveys to perform this reconstruction in the cosmic variance limit. Consistent with previous work, we find that a high fidelity reconstruction of the dipole and quadrupole fields over a variety of scales is indeed possible, and demonstrate the sensitivity of the pSZ effect to primordial tensor modes. Using a principle component analysis, we estimate how many independent modes could be accessed in such a reconstruction. We also comment on a few first applications of a detection of the dipole and quadrupole fields, including a reconstruction of the primordial contribution to our locally observed CMB dipole, a test of statistical homogeneity on large scales from the first modes of the quadrupole field, and a reconstruction technique for the primordial potential on the largest scales.",1

We reduce the problem to a linear matrix equation, whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors determine the collective stability of the beam. We then show that various predictions of the theory agree quite well with results from particle tracking simulations, including the threshold current for transverse instability and the profile of the unstable mode. In particular, we find that predicting collective stability for high energy electron beams at moderate to large values of chromaticity requires the full Fokker-Planck analysis to properly account for the effects of damping and diffusion due to synchrotron radiation.",1

12148,2,"Fluid analogs for rotating black holes Fluid analog models for gravity are based on the idea that any spacetime geometry admits a reinterpretation in which space is thought of as a fluid flowing with a prescribed velocity. This fluid picture is a restatement of the ADM decomposition of the metric. Most of the literature has focused on flat spatial geometries and physical fluid flows, with a view toward possible laboratory realizations. Here we relax these conditions and consider fluid flows on curved and time-dependent spatial geometries, as a way of understanding and visualizing solutions to general relativity. We illustrate the utility of the approach with rotating black holes. For the Kerr black hole we develop a fluid description based on Doran coordinates. For spinning BTZ black holes we develop two different fluid descriptions. One involves static conical spatial slices, with the fluid orbiting the tip of the cone. The other resembles a cosmology, with the fluid flowing on a time-dependent cylindrical geometry.",1

12211,2,"The Evolution of Normal Galaxy X-ray Emission Through Cosmic History: Constraints from the 6 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South We present measurements of the evolution of normal-galaxy X-ray emission from $z\quad \approx $ 0–7 using local galaxies and galaxy samples in the ≈6 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) survey. The majority of the CDF-S galaxies are observed at rest-frame energies above 2 keV, where the emission is expected to be dominated by X-ray binary (XRB) populations, however, hot gas is expected to provide small contributions to the observed-frame ≲1 keV emission at z ≲ 1. We show that a single scaling relation between X-ray luminosity (${L}_{{\rm{X}}}$) and star-formation rate (SFR) literature, is insufficient for characterizing the average X-ray emission at all redshifts. We establish that scaling relations involving not only SFR, but also stellar mass (${M}_{\star }$) and redshift, provide significantly improved characterizations of the average X-ray emission from normal galaxy populations at $z\quad \approx $ 0–7. We further provide the first empirical constraints on the redshift evolution of X-ray emission from both low-mass XRB (LMXB) and high-mass XRB (HMXB) populations and their scalings with ${M}_{\star }$ and SFR, respectively. We find ${L}_{2-10\mathrm{keV}}$(LMXB)/${M}_{\star }\propto {(1+z)}^{2-3}$ and ${L}_{2-10\mathrm{keV}}$(HMXB)/SFR $\propto \quad (1+z)$, and show that these relations are consistent with XRB population-synthesis model predictions, which attribute the increase in LMXB and HMXB scaling relations with redshift as being due to declining host galaxy stellar ages and metallicities, respectively. We discuss how emission from XRBs could provide an important source of heating to the intergalactic medium in the early universe, exceeding that of active galactic nuclei.",1
12248,2,"Generation of circular polarization of gamma ray bursts The generation of the circular polarization of gamma ray burst (GRB) photons is discussed in this paper via their interactions with astroparticles in the presence or absence of background fields such as magnetic fields and noncommutative space-time geometry. Solving the quantum Boltzmann equation for GRB photons as a photon ensemble, we discuss the generation of circular polarization (as Faraday conversion phase shift ΔϕFC) of GRBs in the following cases: (i) intermediate interactions, i.e., the Compton scattering of GRBs in the galaxy cluster magnetic field and in the presence of noncommutative space-time geometry, as well as the scattering of GRBs in the cosmic neutrino background (CNB) and cosmic microwave background (CMB); (ii) interactions with particles and fields in shockwaves, i.e., the Compton scattering of GRBs with accelerated charged particles in the presence of magnetic fields. We found that (i) after shockwave crossing, the greatest contribution of ΔϕFC for energetic GRBs (of the order of GeV and larger) comes from GRB-CMB interactions, but for low-energy GRBs the contributions of the Compton scattering of GRBs in the galaxy cluster magnetic field dominate; (ii) in shockwave crossing, the magnetic field has significant effects on converting a GRB’s linear polarization to a circular one, and this effect can be used to better understand the magnetic profile in shockwaves. The main aim of this work is to study and measure the circular polarization of GRBs for a better understanding of the physics and mechanism of the generation of GRBs and their interactions before reaching us.",1

12376,2,"Achieving cost/performance balance ratio using tiered storage caching techniques: A case study with CephFS As demand for widely accessible storage capacity increases and usage is on the rise, steady IO performance is desired but tends to suffer within multi-user environments. Typical deployments use standard hard drives as the cost per/GB is quite low. On the other hand, HDD based solutions for storage is not known to scale well with process concurrency and soon enough, high rate of IOPs create a “random access” pattern killing performance. Though not all SSDs are alike, SSDs are an established technology often used to address this exact “random access” problem. In this contribution, we will first discuss the IO performance of many different SSD drives (tested in a comparable and standalone manner). We will then be discussing the performance and integrity of at least three low-level disk caching techniques (Flashcache, dm-cache, and bcache) including individual policies, procedures, and IO performance. Furthermore, the STAR online computing infrastructure currently hosts a POSIX-compliant Ceph distributed storage cluster - while caching is not a native feature of CephFS (only exists in the Ceph Object store), we will show how one can implement a caching mechanism profiting from an implementation at a lower level. As our illustration, we will present our CephFS setup, IO performance tests, and overall experience from such configuration.

12698,2,"Fabrication of Ferrite-Copper Block by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) A ferrite has been well known as an effective material for absorbing electromagnetic waves. Various types of the ferrite blocks have been actually used in accelerator fields as the higher-order modes (HOMs) absorbers in the vacuum beam pipes. However, one of difficulties in using the ferrite is to bond it to the beam pipes with a sufficient adhesive force, and to assure the contact with a high thermal conductivity in vacuum. The brazing or Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) is not so easy owing to a low thermal expansion rate and a relatively low tensile strength of the ferrite. We established a method of fabricating a ferrite block bonded to copper by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The ferrite powders are directly sintered on a copper block in the SPS process together with some metals to relax the thermal stress between them. The sintered ferrite-copper block can be brazed or welded to other metal blocks, or directly on the beam pipes. Here reported are R&amp;D results of the fabrication method, and some experimental results on the properties of the ferrite-copper block.",1
12845,2,"Status Report on the R&D of a 5 T/m Normal Conducting Quadrupole Magnet for the 10-MeV Beam Line of the Electron Linac of the Mexican Particle Accelerator Community The Mexican Particle Accelerator Community (CMAP) has endeavoured the development of a 100 MeV electron Linac (eLINAC) that will have three beam lines at 10, 60 and 100 MeV. The Linac, at present under design, will make use of four normal conducting quadrupole magnets for the 10-MeV beam line. The quadrupoles follow a standard type geometry and they will operate using Cu conductors at room temperature. This work reports the progress on the overall quadrupole design, analytic, magnetic, thermal and mechanical studies. In addition, the selection of varied materials for the Yoke and how affects the multipole content and gradient uniformity is explored. A winding strategy is discussed as well as the CMAP plan for the development of the first prototype.",1
12977,2,"A time machine for free fall into the past Inspired by some recent works of Tippett-Tsang and Mallary-Khanna-Price, we present a new spacetime model containing closed timelike curves (CTCs). This model is obtained postulating an ad hoc Lorentzian metric on $\mathbb{R}^4$, which differs from the Minkowski metric only inside a spacetime region bounded by two concentric tori. The resulting spacetime is topologically trivial, free of curvature singularities and is both time and space orientable; besides, the inner region enclosed by the smaller torus is flat and displays geodesic CTCs. Our model shares some similarities with the time machine of Ori and Soen but it has the advantage of a higher symmetry in the metric, allowing for the explicit computation of a class of geodesics. The most remarkable feature emerging from this computation is the presence of future-oriented timelike geodesics starting from a point in the outer Minkowskian region, moving to the inner spacetime region with CTCs, and then returning to the initial spatial position at an earlier time; this means that time travel to the past can be performed by free fall across our time machine. The amount of time travelled into the past is determined quantitatively; this amount can be made arbitrarily large keeping non-large the proper duration of the travel. An important drawback of the model is the violation of the classical energy conditions, a common feature of most time machines. Other problems emerge from our computations of the required (negative) energy densities and of the tidal accelerations; these are small only if the time machine is gigantic.",1
13006,2,"A mathematical solution for the parameters of three interfering resonances The multiple-solution problem in determining the parameters of three interfering resonances from a fit to an experimentally measured distribution is considered from a mathematical viewpoint. It is shown that there are four numerical solutions for a fit with three coherent Breit-Wigner functions. Although explicit analytical formulae cannot be derived in this case, we provide some constraint equations between the four solutions. For the cases of nonrelativistic and relativistic Breit-Wigner forms of amplitude functions, a numerical method is provided to derive the other solutions from that already obtained, based on the obtained constraint equations. In real experimental measurements with more complicated amplitude forms similar to Breit-Wigner functions, the same method can be deduced and performed to get numerical solutions. The good agreement between the solutions found using this mathematical method and those directly from the fit verifies the correctness of the constraint equations and mathematical methodology used.",1
13053,2,"Self-force corrections to the periapsis advance around a spinning black hole The linear in mass ratio correction to the periapsis advance of equatorial nearly circular orbits around a spinning black hole is calculated for the first time and to a very high precision, providing a key benchmark for different approaches modeling spinning binaries. The high precision of the calculation is leveraged to discriminate between two recent incompatible derivations of the 4 post-Newtonian equations of motion. Finally, the limit of the periapsis advance near the innermost stable orbit (ISCO) allows the determination of the ISCO shift, validating previous calculations using the first law of binary mechanics. Calculation of the ISCO shift is further extended into the near-extremal regime (with spins up to 1-a=10-20), revealing new unexpected phenomenology. In particular, we find that the shift of the ISCO does not have a well-defined extremal limit but instead continues to oscillate.",1

13131,2,"Responses of silicon PIN diode to low energy gamma rays It is important to detect low energy gamma rays precisely for the purpose of diagnosis in nuclear medicine, gravitational wave research and detection of underground nuclear test. Since a silicon sensor has an advantage of fast response, good intrinsic energy resolution and providing high signal yield in a small active volume, it can be used to detect low energy gamma rays without the help of a scintillator. We developed silicon PIN diodes and photodiodes on high resistivity, n+ doped, and 6-in. double-side polished silicon wafers.

13233,2,"Multi-layer thick gas electron multiplier (M-THGEM): A new MPGD structure for high-gain operation at low-pressure The operating principle and performances of the Multi-layer Thick Gaseous Electron Multiplier (M-THGEM) are presented. The M-THGEM is a novel hole-type gaseous electron multiplier produced by multi-layer printed circuit board technology; it consists of a densely perforated assembly of multiple insulating substrate sheets (e.g., FR-4), sandwiched between thin metallic-electrode layers. The electron avalanche processes occur along the successive multiplication stages within the M-THGEM holes, under the action of strong dipole fields resulting from the application of suitable potential differences between the electrodes. The present work focuses on the investigation of two different geometries: a two-layer M-THGEM (either as single or double-cascade detector) and a single three-layer M-THGEM element, tested in various low-pressure He-based gas mixtures. The intrinsically robust confinement of the avalanche volume within the M-THGEM holes provides an efficient reduction of the photon-induced secondary effects, resulting in a high-gain operation over a broad pressure range, even in pure elemental gas. The operational principle, main properties (maximum achievable gain, long-term stability, energy resolution, etc.) under different irradiation conditions, as well as capabilities and potential applications are presented and discussed.",1
13251,2,"CMB Delensing Beyond the B Modes Gravitational lensing by large-scale structure significantly impacts observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): it smooths the acoustic peaks in temperature and E-mode polarization power spectra, correlating previously uncorrelated modes; and it converts E-mode polarization into B-mode polarization. The act of measuring and removing the effect of lensing from CMB maps, or delensing, has been well studied in the context of B modes, but little attention has been given to the delensing of the temperature and E modes. In this paper, we model the expected delensed T and E power spectra to all orders in the lensing potential, demonstrating the sharpening of the acoustic peaks and a significant reduction in lens-induced power spectrum covariances. We then perform cosmological forecasts, demonstrating that delensing will yield improved sensitivity to parameters with upcoming surveys. We highlight the breaking of the degeneracy between the effective number of neutrino species and primordial helium fraction as a concrete application. We also show that delensing increases cosmological information as long as the measured lensing reconstruction is included in the analysis. We conclude that with future data, delensing will be crucial not only for primordial B-mode science but for a range of other observables as well.",1

As an illustration the procedure is successfully applied to the Cornell potential by means of very simple algebraic manipulations. However, instead of providing numerical eigenvalues for the only consideration of the small strength of the related linear potential as in the previous reports, the present model puts forward a clean route to interpret related experimental or precise numerical results involving a wide range of the linear potential strengths. We hope this new technique will shed some light on the questions concerning the limitations of the traditional perturbation techniques.",1

13371,2,"Mechanics of spacetime — A Solid Mechanics perspective on the theory of General Relativity We present an elastic constitutive model of gravity where we identify physical space with the mid-hypersurface of an elastic hyperplate called the “cosmic fabric” and spacetime with the fabric’s worldvolume. Using a Lagrangian formulation, we show that the fabric’s behavior as derived from Hooke’s Law is analogous to that of spacetime per the Field Equations of General Relativity (GR). The study is conducted in the limit of small strains, or analogously, in the limit of weak and nearly static gravitational fields. The Fabric’s Lagrangian outside of inclusions is shown to have the same form as the Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian for free space. Properties of the fabric such as strain, stress, vibrations and elastic moduli are related to properties of gravity and space, such as the gravitational potential, gravitational acceleration, gravitational waves and the energy density of free space. By introducing a mechanical analogy of GR, we enable the application of Solid Mechanics tools to address problems in Cosmology.",1

This allows a complete characterization of non-separable Majorana fermion states to be obtained. These results may have direct application in quantum metrology: using Majorana systems, sub-shot-noise accuracy in parameter estimations can be achieved without preliminary resource-consuming, state entanglement operations.",1
13415,2,"Vortices with scalar condensates in two-component Ginzburg–Landau systems In a class of two-component Ginzburg–Landau models (TCGL) with a U(1) × U(1) symmetric potential, vortices with a condensate at their core may have significantly lower energies than the Abrikosov–Nielsen–Olesen (ANO) ones. On the example of liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) above the critical temperature for protons we show that the ANO vortices become unstable against core-condensation, while condensate-core (CC) vortices are stable. For LMH the ratio of the masses of the two types of condensates, M=m2/m1 is large, and then as a consequence the energy per flux quantum of the vortices, En/n becomes a non-monotonous function of the number of flux quanta, n . This leads to yet another manifestation of neither type 1 nor type 2, (type 1.5) superconductivity: superconducting and normal domains coexist while various “giant” vortices form. We note that LMH provides a particularly clean example of type 1.5 state as the interband coupling between electronic and protonic Cooper-pairs is forbidden.",1

13470,2,"Looking at cosmic near-infrared background radiation anisotropies The cosmic infrared background (CIB) contains emissions accumulated over the entire history of the Universe, including from objects inaccessible to individual telescopic studies. The near-IR (~1-10 mic) part of the CIB, and its fluctuations, reflects emissions from nucleosynthetic sources and gravitationally accreting black holes (BHs). If known galaxies are removed to sufficient depths the source-subtracted CIB fluctuations at near-IR can reveal sources present in the first-stars-era and possibly new stellar populations at more recent times. This review discusses the recent progress in this newly emerging field which identified, with new data and methodology, significant source-subtracted CIB fluctuations substantially in excess of what can be produced by remaining known galaxies. The CIB fluctuations further appear coherent with unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB) indicating a very high fraction of BHs among the new sources producing the CIB fluctuations. These observations have led to intensive theoretical efforts to explain the measurements and their properties. While current experimental configurations have limitations in decisively probing these theories, their potentially remarkable implications will be tested in the upcoming CIB measurements with the ESA's Euclid dark energy mission. We describe the goals and methodologies of LIBRAE (Looking at Infrared Background Radiation with Euclid), a NASA-selected project for CIB science with Euclid, which has the potential for transforming the field into a new area of precision cosmology.",1
13515,2,"Requiem for an ideal clock The 'problem of time' remains an unresolved issue in all known physical descriptions of the Universe. One aspect of this problem is the conspicuous absence of time in the Wheeler-Dewitt equation, which is the analogue of the Schrodinger equation for the Universal wavefunction. Page and Wootters famously addressed this problem by providing a mechanism for effectively introducing time evolution. Their method, which is sometimes called the conditional probability interpretation (CPI), requires the identification of an internal clock system that is meant to keep time for the remainder of the Universe. Most investigations into this idea employ the idealized limit of a non-interacting clock system, the so-called ideal clock. However, by allowing for interactions, we have found the counter-intuitive result that a non-interacting clock is not necessarily the optimal choice, even if it is 'ideal'. In particular, the uncertainty that is associated with the physical measurement of an atomic clock is found to decrease monotonically as the interactions grow stronger. This observation, which is reinforced by a previous study using a semi-classical clock, paves the way to an independent argument that is based on the energy conservation of any isolated system. Our conclusion is that ideal clocks must be prohibited from the CPI, as interactions are necessary for describing time evolution as a strict matter of principle.",1

Computer simulation is carried out taking into account positron energy loss in a thick converter. Total yield of positrons as a function of the thickness of the converter as well as the energy spectrum of positrons for the chosen converter thickness are obtained.

Density profiles of galactic halos The multicomponent dark matter model with self-scattering and inter-conversions of species into one another is an alternative dark matter paradigm that is capable of resolving the long-standing problems of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at small scales. In this paper, we have studied in detail the properties of dark matter halos with $M \sim 4-5 \times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ obtained in $N$-body cosmological simulations with the simplest two-component (2cDM) model. A large set of velocity-dependent cross-section prescriptions for elastic scattering and mass conversions, $\sigma_s(v)\propto v^{a_s}$ and $\sigma_c(v)\propto v^{a_c}$, has been explored and the results were compared with observational data. The results demonstrate that self-interactions with the cross-section per particle mass evaluated at $v=100$ km s$^{-1}$ being in the range of $0.01\lesssim \sigma_0/m\lesssim 1$ cm$^2$g$^{-1}$ robustly suppress central cusps, thus resolving the core-cusp problem. The core radii are controlled by the values of $\sigma_0/m$ and the DM cross-section's velocity-dependent power-law indices $(a_s,a_c)$, but are largely insensitive to the species' mass degeneracy. These values are in full agreement with those resolving the substructure and too-big-to-fail problems. We have also studied the evolution of halos in the 2cDM model with cosmic time.",1

Machine learning classifiers are powerful tools capable of reducing highly multivariate problems into univariate ones, on which commonly used tests such as $\chi^2$ or Kolmogorov-Smirnov may be applied. We explore applying both traditional and machine-learning-based tests to several example problems, and study how the power of each approach depends on the dimensionality.

These equations couple a metric over a compact Riemann surface with a hermitian metric over a holomorphic line bundle equipped with a fixed global section -- the Higgs field --, and have a symplectic interpretation as moment-map equations. Applying the Kahler-quotient procedure, the corresponding moduli space acquires a generalized Weil-Petersson metric. As a particular case of the gravitating vortex equations on the complex projective line, we find the Einstein-Bogomol'nyi equations, previously studied in the theory of cosmic strings in physics. We prove two main results in this paper. Our first main result gives a converse to an existence theorem of Y. Yang for the Einstein-Bogomol'nyi equations, establishing in this way a correspondence with Geometric Invariant Theory for these equations. In particular, we prove a conjecture by Y.

13865,2,"Generalized spheroidal spacetimes in 5-D Einstein–Maxwell–Gauss–Bonnet gravity The field equations for static EGBM gravity are obtained and transformed to an equivalent form through a coordinate redefinition. A form for one of the metric potentials that generalizes the spheroidal ansatz of Vaidya–Tikekar superdense stars and additionally prescribing the electric field intensity yields viable solutions. Some special cases of the general solution are considered and analogous classes in the Einstein framework are studied. In particular the Finch–Skea ansatz is examined in detail and found to satisfy the elementary physical requirements. These include positivity of pressure and density, the existence of a pressure free hypersurface marking the boundary, continuity with the exterior metric, a subluminal sound speed as well as the energy conditions. Moreover, the solution possesses no coordinate singularities. It is found that the impact of the Gauss–Bonnet term is to correct undesirable features in the pressure profile and sound speed index when compared to the equivalent Einstein gravity model. Furthermore graphical analyses suggest that higher densities are achievable for the same radial values when compared to the 5-dimensional Einstein case.

Using Monte Carlo (MC) based GEANT4 simulation, numerous parameters influencing the light collection and thereby the energy resolution of the antineutrino detector module are studied: e.g., degrees of scintillator surface roughness, reflector type, and its applying method onto scintillator and light guide surface, the reflectivity of the reflector, light guide geometries and diameter of the photocathode. The impact of each parameter is investigated by looking at the detected spectrum, i.e. the number photoelectrons per depositing energy. In addition, the average light collection efficiency of the detector module and its spatial variation are calculated for each simulation setup. According to the simulation results, it is found that photocathode size, light guide shape, reflectivity of reflecting material and wrapping method show a significant impact on the light collection efficiency while scintillator surface polishing level and the choose of reflector type show relatively less impact.

The heart of the proof is to show that after separation of variables one has uniform boundedness of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the resulting radial o.d.e. over all frequencies $\omega$ and $\ell$. This is non-trivial because the natural $T$ conservation law is sign-indefinite in the black hole interior. In the physical space picture, our results imply that the Cauchy evolution from the event horizon to the Cauchy horizon is a Hilbert space isomorphism, where the past (resp. future) Hilbert space is defined by the finiteness of the degenerate $T$ energy fluxes on both components of the event (resp. Cauchy) horizon. Finally, we prove that, in contrast to the above, for a generic set of cosmological constants $\Lambda$, there is no analogous finite $T$ energy scattering theory for either the linear wave equation or the Klein-Gordon equation with conformal mass on the (anti-) de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstr\""om interior.",1
14356,2,"A fermionic code related to the exceptional group $E_8$ In this paper we study the Hamming-like fermionic code encoding three-qubits into sixteen Majorana modes recently introduced by Hastings. We show that although this fermionic code cannot be obtained from a single qubit stabilizer code via the usual procedure however, it can be obtained from two, qubit stabilizer ones via a glueing procedure combining both single and double occupancy embeddings of qubits into fermionic Fock space. This technique identifies the code subspace as a Cartan subspace of the largest exceptional group $E_8$. In arriving at these results we develop a general formalism for implementing this glueing procedure via the use of intertwiners between different subsectors of the Fock space realizing embedded qubits.",1
14537,2,"Study of the spatial resolution of low-material GEM tracking detectors The spatial resolution of GEM based tracking detectors has been simulated and measured. The simulation includes the GEANT4 based transport of high energy electrons with careful accounting for atomic relaxation processes including emission of fluorescent photons and Auger electrons and custom post-processing, including accounting for diffusion, gas amplification fluctuations, the distribution of signals on readout electrodes, electronics noise and a particular algorithm of the final coordinate calculation (center of gravity). The simulation demonstrates that a minimum of the spatial resolution of about 10 μm can be achieved with strip pitches from 250 μm to 300 μm. For larger pitches the resolution is quickly degrading reaching 80-100 μm at a pitch of 500 μm. The spatial resolution of low-material triple-GEM detectors for the DEUTRON facility at the VEPP-3 storage ring is measured at the extracted beam facility of the VEPP-4M collider. The amount of material in these detectors is reduced by etching the copper of the GEMs electrodes and using a readout structure on a thin kapton foil rather than on a glass fibre plate. The exact amount of material in one DEUTRON detector is measured by studying multiple scattering of 100 MeV electrons in it. The result of these measurements is X/X0 = 2.4×10−3 corresponding to a thickness of the copper layers of the GEM foils of 3 μm. The spatial resolution of one DEUTRON detector is measured with 500 MeV electrons and the measured value is equal to 35 ± 1 μm for orthogonal tracks.",1
14577,2,"Influence of Earth-Directed Coronal Mass Ejections on the Sun's Shadow Observed by the Tibet-III Air Shower Array We examine the possible influence of Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (ECMEs) on the Sun's shadow in the 3~TeV cosmic-ray intensity observed by the Tibet-III air shower (AS) array. We confirm a clear solar-cycle variation of the intensity deficit in the Sun's shadow during ten years between 2000 and 2009. This solar-cycle variation is overall reproduced by our Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the Sun's shadow based on the potential field model of the solar magnetic field averaged over each solar rotation period. We find, however, that the magnitude of the observed intensity deficit in the Sun's shadow is significantly less than that predicted by MC simulations, particularly during the period around solar maximum when a significant number of ECMEs is recorded. The $\chi^2$ tests of the agreement between the observations and the MC simulations show that the difference is larger during the periods when the ECMEs occur, and the difference is reduced if the periods of ECMEs are excluded from the analysis. This suggests the first experimental evidence of the ECMEs affecting the Sun's shadow observed in the 3~TeV cosmic-ray intensity.",1

14669,2,"Symmetry-guided large-scale shell-model theory In this review, we present a symmetry-guided strategy that utilizes exact as well as partial symmetries for enabling a deeper understanding of and advancing ab initio studies for determining the microscopic structure of atomic nuclei. These symmetries expose physically relevant degrees of freedom that, for large-scale calculations with QCD-inspired interactions, allow the model space size to be reduced through a very structured selection of the basis states to physically relevant subspaces. This can guide explorations of simple patterns in nuclei and how they emerge from first principles, as well as extensions of the theory beyond current limitations toward heavier nuclei and larger model spaces. This is illustrated for the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell model (SA-NCSM) and two significant underlying symmetries, the symplectic Sp(3,R) group and its deformation-related SU(3) subgroup. We review the broad scope of nuclei, where these symmetries have been found to play a key role: from light to intermediate-mass nuclei, based on first-principle explorations; through the Hoyle state in C-12, within a no-core shell-model perspective; up to strongly deformed species of the rare-earth and actinide regions, as investigated in earlier studies. A complementary picture, driven by symmetries dual to Sp(3,R), is also discussed. We briefly review symmetry-guided techniques that prove useful in various nuclear-theory models, such as Elliott model, ab initio SA-NCSM, symplectic model, pseudo-SU(3) and pseudo-symplectic models, ab initio hyperspherical harmonics method, ab initio lattice effective field theory, exact pairing-plus-shell model approaches, and cluster models. Important implications of these approaches that have deepened our understanding of emergent phenomena in nuclei, such as enhanced collectivity, giant resonances, pairing, halo, and clustering, are discussed.",1

The spectrum is shown to be sensitive to the ground-state hyperfine splitting, the corresponding triplet-to-singlet ratio, and the kinetic energy distribution in the 3p state. The hyperfine splitting and triplet-to-singlet ratio are found to be consistent with the values expected from theoretical and experimental investigations and, therefore, were fixed accordingly in order to reduce the uncertainties in the further reconstruction of the kinetic energy distribution. The presence of high-energetic components was established and quantified in both a phenomenological, i.e. cascade-model-free fit, and in a direct deconvolution of the Doppler broadening based on the Bayesian method.",1
14704,2,"On the origin of dual Lax pairs and their $r$-matrix structure We establish the algebraic origin of the following observations made previously by the authors and coworkers: (i) A given integrable PDE in 1+1 dimensions within the Zakharov–Shabat scheme related to a Lax pair can be cast in two distinct, dual Hamiltonian formulations; (ii) Associated to each formulation is a Poisson bracket and a phase space (which are not compatible in the sense of Magri); (iii) Each matrix in the Lax pair satisfies a linear Poisson algebra a la Sklyanin characterized by the same classical r matrix. We develop the general concept of dual Lax pairs and dual Hamiltonian formulation of an integrable field theory. We elucidate the origin of the common r -matrix structure by tracing it back to a single Lie–Poisson bracket on a suitable coadjoint orbit of the loop algebra sl(2,C)⊗C(λ,λ−1) .

14730,2,"Longitudinal bunch dynamics study with coherent synchrotron radiation An electron bunch circulating in a storage ring constitutes a dynamical system with both longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom. Through a self-interaction with the wakefields created by the bunch, certain of these degrees may get excited, defining a set of eigenmodes analogous to a spectroscopic series. The present study focuses on the longitudinal modes of a single bunch. The excitation of a mode appears as an amplitude modulation at the mode frequency of the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) emitted by the bunch. The modulations are superimposed on a much larger continuum from CSR emission in the continuous mode. A given eigenmode is classified by the integer m which is the ratio of the mode frequency to the synchrotron frequency. The present measurements extend up to m=8 and focus on the region near the instability thresholds. At threshold the modes are excited sequentially, resembling a staircase when the mode frequencies are plotted as a function of bunch length or synchrotron frequency. Adjacent modes are observed to coexist at the boundaries between the modes. An energy-independent correlation is observed between the threshold current for an instability and the corresponding zero-current bunch length. Measurements were made at five beam energies between 1.0 and 2.9 GeV at the Canadian Light Source. The CSR was measured in the time domain using an unbiased Schottky diode spanning 50–75 GHz.",1

The experiments were performed at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility using its unique configuration of a photocathode rf gun injecting beam into two separated nine-cell cavities in series with corrector magnets and beam position monitors (BPMs) located before, between, and after them. Oscillations of ∼100  kHz in the vertical plane and ∼380  kHz in the horizontal plane with up to 600-μm amplitudes were observed in a 3-MHz micropulse repetition rate beam with charges of 100, 300, 500, and 1000  pC/b. However, the effects were much reduced at 100  pC/b. The measurements were based on HOM detector circuitry targeting the first and second dipole passbands, rf BPM bunch-by-bunch array data, imaging cameras, and a framing camera. Calculations reproduced the oscillation frequencies of the phenomena in the vertical case. In principle, these fundamental results may be scaled to cryomodule configurations of major accelerator facilities.",1

14929,2,"Small-Scale Challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM Paradigm The dark energy plus cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than ∼1 Mpc and mass scales smaller than ∼1011M⊙, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter–dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naïvely predicted in ΛCDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with ΛCDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of ΛCDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the ΛCDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.",1
14936,2,"Deep morphological and spectral study of the SNR RCW 86 with Fermi-LAT RCW 86 is a young supernova remnant (SNR) showing a shell-type structure at several wavelengths and is thought to be an efficient cosmic-ray (CR) accelerator. Earlier Fermi Large Area Telescope results reported the detection of γ-ray emission coincident with the position of RCW 86 but its origin (leptonic or hadronic) remained unclear due to the poor statistics. Thanks to 6.5 years of data acquired by the Fermi-LAT and the new event reconstruction Pass 8, we report the significant detection of spatially extended emission coming from RCW 86. The spectrum is described by a power-law function with a very hard photon index (${\rm{\Gamma }}=1.42\pm {0.1}_{{\rm{stat}}}\pm {0.06}_{{\rm{syst}}}$) in the 0.1–500 GeV range and an energy flux above 100 MeV of ($2.91\pm {0.8}_{{\rm{stat}}}\pm {0.12}_{{\rm{syst}}}$) $\,\times \,{10}^{-11}$ erg cm(−)(2) s(−)(1). Gathering all the available multiwavelength (MWL) data, we perform a broadband modeling of the nonthermal emission of RCW 86 to constrain parameters of the nearby medium and bring new hints about the origin of the γ-ray emission. For the whole SNR, the modeling favors a leptonic scenario in the framework of a two-zone model with an average magnetic field of 10.2 ± 0.7 μG and a limit on the maximum energy injected into protons of 2 × 10(49) erg for a density of 1 cm(−)(3).

14977,2,"Exploring the Nature of Gravity I clarify the differences between various approaches in the literature which attempt to link gravity and thermodynamics. I then describe a new perspective based on the following features: (1) As in the case of any other matter field, the gravitational field equations should also remain unchanged if a constant is added to the Lagrangian; in other words, the field equations of gravity should remain invariant under the transformation $T^a_b \to T^a_b + \delta^a_b $(constant). (2) Each event of spacetime has a certain number ($f$) of microscopic degrees of freedom (`atoms of spacetime'). This quantity $f$ is proportional to the area measure of an equi-geodesic surface, centered at that event, when the geodesic distance tends to zero. The spacetime should have a zero-point length in order for $f$ to remain finite. (3) The dynamics is determined by extremizing the heat density at all events of the spacetime. The heat density is the sum of a part contributed by matter and a part contributed by the atoms of spacetime, with the latter being $L_P^{-4} f$. The implications of this approach are discussed.",1

15099,2,"Effect of in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section on proton-proton momentum correlation in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions The proton-proton momentum correlation function from different rapidity regions is systematically investigated for the Au + Au collisions at different impact parameters and different energies from 400A MeV to 1500A MeV in the framework of the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model complemented by the Lednický-Lyuboshitz analytical method. In particular, the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross-section dependence of the correlation function is brought into focus, while the impact parameter and energy dependence of the momentum correlation function are also explored. The sizes of the emission source are extracted by fitting the momentum correlation functions using the Gaussian source method. We find that the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section obviously influences the proton-proton momentum correlation function, which is from the whole-rapidity or projectile or target rapidity region at smaller impact parameters, but there is no effect on the mid-rapidity proton-proton momentum correlation function, which indicates that the emission mechanism differs between projectile or target rapidity and mid-rapidity protons.",1
15132,2,"Cold neutral atoms via charge exchange from excited state positronium: a proposal We present a method for generating cold neutral atoms via charge exchange reactions between trapped ions and Rydberg positronium. The high charge exchange reaction cross section leads to efficient neutralisation of the ions and since the positronium-ion mass ratio is small, the neutrals do not gain appreciable kinetic energy in the process. When the original ions are cold the reaction produces neutrals that can be trapped or further manipulated with electromagnetic fields. Because a wide range of species can be targeted we envisage that our scheme may enable experiments at low temperature that have been hitherto intractable due to a lack of cooling methods. We present an estimate for achievable temperatures, neutral number and density in an experiment where the neutrals are formed at a milli-Kelvin temperature from either directly or sympathetically cooled ions confined on an ion chip. The neutrals may then be confined by their magnetic moment in a co-located magnetic minimum well also formed on the chip. We discuss general experimental requirements.",1

15260,2,"Eccentric, nonspinning, inspiral, Gaussian-process merger approximant for the detection and characterization of eccentric binary black hole mergers We present ENIGMA, a time domain, inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model that describes nonspinning binary black holes systems that evolve on moderately eccentric orbits. The inspiral evolution is described using a consistent combination of post-Newtonian theory, self-force and black hole perturbation theory. Assuming eccentric binaries that circularize prior to coalescence, we smoothly match the eccentric inspiral with a stand-alone, quasicircular merger, which is constructed using machine learning algorithms that are trained with quasicircular numerical relativity waveforms. We show that ENIGMA reproduces with excellent accuracy the dynamics of quasicircular compact binaries. We validate ENIGMA using a set of Einstein Toolkit eccentric numerical relativity waveforms, which describe eccentric binary black hole mergers with mass-ratios between 1≤q≤5.5, and eccentricities e0≲0.2 ten orbits before merger. We use this model to explore in detail the physics that can be extracted with moderately eccentric, nonspinning binary black hole mergers. In particular, we use ENIGMA to show that the gravitational wave transients GW150914, GW151226, GW170104, GW170814 and GW170608 can be effectively recovered with spinning, quasicircular templates if the eccentricity of these events at a gravitational wave frequency of 10 Hz satisfies e0≤{0.175,0.125,0.175,0.175,0.125}, respectively. We show that if these systems have eccentricities e0∼0.1 at a gravitational wave frequency of 10 Hz, they can be misclassified as quasicircular binaries due to parameter space degeneracies between eccentricity and spin corrections. Using our catalog of eccentric numerical relativity simulations, we discuss the importance of including higher-order waveform multipoles in gravitational wave searches of eccentric binary black hole mergers.",1
15269,2,"High gradient, high reliability, and low wakefield accelerating structures for the FERMI FEL The FERMI seeded free-electron laser (FEL), located at the Elettra laboratory in Trieste, is a 4th generation light source operating in the vacuum ultraviolet to soft X-rays range. The FEL design is based on an external seeding scheme which improves the output pulse coherence and the central wavelength control and reduces the spectral bandwidth. FERMI has achieved its original energy target by producing photon energies above 300 eV from a 1.50 GeV, 600 A peak current, electron beam. However, there is a strong scientific motivation to push the energy envelop further higher to photon energy up to 600 eV to cover both the x-ray absorption edges of nitrogen K (400 eV) and oxygen K (532 eV). To achieve this goal, the electron beam energy will be increased from 1.50 GeV to 1.80 GeV and the peak beam current will be pushed towards 1 kA. This requires essentially the development of more reliable high gradient S-band accelerating structures, with low wakefields contribution up to 1 nC charge per bunch. Accordingly, in the following, we present the design of high gradient, high reliability, and low wakefield S-band accelerating structures for the upgrade program of the FERMI linac.",1
15298,2,"Kerr-de Sitter spacetime, Penrose process and the generalized area theorem We investigate various aspects of energy extraction via the Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter spacetime. We show that the increase in the value of a positive cosmological constant, Λ, always reduces the efficiency of this process. The Kerr-de Sitter spacetime has two ergospheres associated with the black hole and the cosmological event horizons. We prove by analyzing turning points of the trajectory that the Penrose process in the cosmological ergoregion is never possible. We next show that in this process both the black hole and cosmological event horizons’ areas increase, and the latter becomes possible when the particle coming from the black hole ergoregion escapes through the cosmological event horizon. We identify a new, local mass function instead of the mass parameter, to prove this generalized area theorem. This mass function takes care of the local spacetime energy due to the cosmological constant as well, including that which arises due to the frame-dragging effect due to spacetime rotation. While the current observed value of Λ is quite small, its effect in this process could be considerable in the early Universe scenario where its value is much larger, where the two horizons could have comparable sizes. In particular, the various results we obtain here are also evaluated in a triply degenerate limit of the Kerr-de Sitter spacetime we find, in which radial values of the inner, the black hole and the cosmological event horizons are nearly coincident.",1
15371,2,"Some Quantum-Mechanical Relations in case of singular operators and potentials Elaboration of some fundamental relations in three dimensional quantum mechanics is considered in connection to taking into account the restriction on domains in radial distance. In such cases the boundary behavior of the radial wave function and singularity of operators at the origin of coordinates contribute to these relations. In particular, we derive the relation between the average value of operator time derivative and the time derivative of mean value of this operator, which usually is considered as the same by definition. The deviation from known result is deduced manifested by extra term, which depends on boundary behavior mentioned above. The general form for this extra term participates to the hypervirial like theorems. As a particular case, the virial theorem for a Coulomb potential is considered and correction to the Kramers sum rule is derived. Moreover the corrected Ehrenfest theorem is deduced also and its consistency with real physical picture is demonstrated.",1
15416,2,"Multi-proton bunch driven hollow plasma wakefield acceleration in the nonlinear regime Proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration has been demonstrated in simulations to be capable of accelerating particles to the energy frontier in a single stage, but its potential is hindered by the fact that currently available proton bunches are orders of magnitude longer than the plasma wavelength. Fortunately, proton micro-bunching allows driving plasma waves resonantly. In this paper, we propose using a hollow plasma channel for multiple proton bunch driven plasma wakefield acceleration and demonstrate that it enables the operation in the nonlinear regime and resonant excitation of strong plasma waves. This new regime also involves beneficial features of hollow channels for the accelerated beam (such as emittance preservation and a uniform accelerating field) and long buckets of stable deceleration for the drive beam. The regime is attained at a proper ratio between plasma skin depth, driver radius, hollow channel radius, and micro-bunch period.",1
15421,2,"Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants as Sources of Cosmic Rays Below the ""Ankle"" We investigate non-thermal electron and nuclei energy losses within the binary neutron star merger remnant produced by the event GW170817. The lack of a cooling feature within the detected synchrotron emission from the source is used to constrain the magnetic field at the mG level, assuming that this emission is electron synchrotron in origin, and that the accelerated spectrum in the electrons follows the form $dN/dE_e \propto E_e^{-2}$. The level of subsequent gamma-ray emission from the source is demonstrated to provide a further constraint on the source magnetic field strength. We also put forward alternative strong ($\sim$10~G) magnetic field scenarios able to support this emission. For such stronger fields, the photodisintegration of non-thermal nuclei within the source is considered, and a bottleneck period of $\sim$5-30 days is found when this process peaks.

The impact of second-order effects accounting for the non-linear evolution of large-scale structures is evaluated propagating for the first time the full CMB lensing jacobian together with the light rays trajectories. We carefully investigate the robustness of our approach against several numerical effects in the raytracing procedure and in the N-body simulation itself, and find no evidence of large contaminations. We discuss the impact of beyond-Born corrections on lensed CMB observables, and compare our results with recent analytical predictions that appeared in the literature, finding a good agreement, and extend these results to smaller angular scales. We measure the gravitationally-induced CMB polarization rotation that appears in the geodesic equation at second order, and compare this result with the latest analytical predictions. We then present the detection prospect of beyond-Born effects with the future CMB-S4 experiment.

15634,2,"Chiral anomaly and longitudinal magnetotransport in type-II Weyl semimetals In the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields, the violation of a separate number conservation laws for the three-dimensional left- and right-handed Weyl fermions is known as the chiral anomaly. The recent discovery of Weyl and Dirac semimetals has paved the way for experimentally testing the effects of chiral anomaly via magnetotransport measurements, since chiral anomaly can lead to negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) while the transverse magnetoresistance remains positive. More recently, a type-II Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase has been proposed, where the nodal points possess a finite density of states due to the touching between electron and hole pockets. It has been suggested that the main difference between the two types of WSMs (type I and type II) is that in the latter, chiral-anomaly-induced negative LMR (positive longitudinal magnetoconductance) is strongly anisotropic, vanishing when the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of tilt of Weyl fermion cones in a type-II WSM. We analyze chiral anomaly in a type-II WSM in a quasiclassical Boltzmann framework, and find that the chiral-anomaly-induced positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity is present along any arbitrary direction. Thus, our results are pertinent for uncovering transport signatures of type-II WSMs in different candidate materials.",1

In order to meet the requirements of the high-gradient accelerators, the ARES linac was optimized to provide ~100 MeV, low charge (0.5 to 30 picocoulombs) and ultra-short electron bunches (sub-femtosecond to dozens of femtoseconds) with ultra-small spot sizes (less than a few micrometers) and excellent timing stability (rms bunch arrival-time jitter < 10 femtoseconds). As one of the research branches, the generation of a train of dozensof-femtosecond-long electron bunches with terahertz repetition rate was experimentally investigated at the SPARC_LAB test facility. A novel method was proposed to simultaneously measure the relative misalignments of the individual electron bunches in both planes, which is beyond the reach of up-to-date beam position monitors.",1
15817,2,"Dissolution of topological Fermi arcs in a dirty Weyl semimetal Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have recently attracted a great deal of attention as they provide a condensed matter realization of chiral anomaly, feature topologically protected Fermi arc surface states, and sustain sharp chiral Weyl quasiparticles up to a critical disorder at which a continuous quantum phase transition (QPT) drives the system into a metallic phase. We here numerically demonstrate that with increasing strength of disorder, the Fermi arc gradually loses its sharpness, and close to the WSM-metal QPT it completely dissolves into the metallic bath of the bulk. The predicted topological nature of the WSM-metal QPT and the resulting bulk-boundary correspondence across this transition can be directly observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Fourier transformed scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements by following the continuous deformation of the Fermi arcs with increasing disorder in recently discovered Weyl materials.",1

While for two-fermion bound states due to the Pauli blocking in a dense medium the binding energy is reduced and vanishes at a critical density (Mott effect), for three-fermion bound states, it is shown to be nonzero and positive. Therefore, beyond the Mott density of the two-fermion bound state, three-fermion bound states can exist in a medium and, therefore, be denoted as the in-medium Borromean states.",1
15859,2,"Higher-Order Wave Equation Within the Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau Formalism Within the framework of the Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau (DKP) formalism a consistent approach to derivation of the third-order wave equation is suggested. For this purpose, an additional algebraic object, the so-called q-commutator (q is a primitive cubic root of unity) and a new set of matrices η$_{μ}$ instead of the original matrices β$_{μ}$ of the DKP algebra are introduced. It is shown that in terms of these η-matrices, we have succeeded to reduce the procedure of the construction of cubic root of the third-order wave operator to a few simple algebraic transformations and to a certain operation of passage to the limit z → q, where z is some complex deformation parameter entering into the definition of the η$_{μ}$-matrices. A corresponding generalization of the result obtained to the case of interaction with an external electromagnetic field introduced through the minimal coupling scheme is performed. The application to the problem of construction within the DKP approach of the path integral representation in parasuperspace for the propagator of a massive vector particle in a background gauge field is discussed.",1
15870,2,"Small scale problems of the $\Lambda$CDM model: a short review The ΛCDM model, or concordance cosmology, as it is often called, is a paradigm at its maturity. It is clearly able to describe the universe at large scale, even if some issues remain open, such as the cosmological constant problem, the small-scale problems in galaxy formation, or the unexplained anomalies in the CMB. ΛCDM clearly shows difficulty at small scales, which could be related to our scant understanding, from the nature of dark matter to that of gravity; or to the role of baryon physics, which is not well understood and implemented in simulation codes or in semi-analytic models. At this stage, it is of fundamental importance to understand whether the problems encountered by the ΛDCM model are a sign of its limits or a sign of our failures in getting the finer details right. In the present paper, we will review the small-scale problems of the ΛCDM model, and we will discuss the proposed solutions and to what extent they are able to give us a theory accurately describing the phenomena in the complete range of scale of the observed universe.",1
15916,2,"Finite-size corrections to scaling of the magnetization distribution in the two-dimensional $XY$ model at zero temperature The zero-temperature, classical XY model on an L×L square lattice is studied by exploring the distribution ΦL(y) of its centered and normalized magnetization y in the large-L limit. An integral representation of the cumulant generating function, known from earlier works, is used for the numerical evaluation of ΦL(y), and the limit distribution ΦL→∞(y)=Φ0(y) is obtained with high precision. The two leading finite-size corrections ΦL(y)−Φ0(y)≈a1(L)Φ1(y)+a2(L)Φ2(y) are also extracted both from numerics and from analytic calculations. We find that the amplitude a1(L) scales as ln(L/L0)/L2 and the shape correction function Φ1(y) can be expressed through the low-order derivatives of the limit distribution, Φ1(y)=[yΦ0(y)+Φ0′(y)]′. Thus, Φ1(y) carries the same universal features as the limit distribution and can be used for consistency checks of universality claims based on finite-size systems. The second finite-size correction has an amplitude a2(L)∝1/L2 and one finds that a2Φ2(y)≪a1Φ1(y) already for small system size (L>10). We illustrate the feasibility of observing the calculated finite-size corrections by performing simulations of the XY model at low temperatures, including T=0.",1

The observations were performed with the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph with a signal-to-noise ratio of 40 per 2.5 km s(−)(1) per pixel at ∼5000 Å. Thirteen CO vibrational bands in this absorber are detected: the ${{\rm{A}}}^{1}{\rm{\Pi }}$ − ${{\rm{X}}}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$ ($\nu ^{\prime} $, 0) for $\nu ^{\prime} =0\mbox{--}8$, ${{\rm{B}}}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$ − ${{\rm{X}}}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$ (0, 0), ${{\rm{C}}}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$ − ${{\rm{X}}}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$ (0, 0), and ${{\rm{E}}}^{1}{\rm{\Pi }}$ − ${{\rm{X}}}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$ (0, 0) singlet–singlet bands and the ${d}^{3}{\rm{\Delta }}$ − ${{\rm{X}}}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$ (5, 0) singlet–triplet band.

Our approach is based on the nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory generalized to an extended Kadanoff-Baym contour. We find that the density-density OTOC is most enhanced at intermediate coupling around the metal-insulator phase transition. In the high-temperature limit, the OTOC remains nontrivially finite and interaction dependent, even though dynamical charge correlations probed by an ordinary response function are completely suppressed.

We show how a fully diagonal interaction at the similarity cutoff λ→0 may be obtained from the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian and quantify the diagonalness by means of operator norms. While the fixed points for both generators are equivalent when no bound-states are allowed by the interaction, the differences arising from the presence of the Deuteron bound-state can be disentangled very clearly by analyzing the evolved interactions in the infrared limit λ→0 on a finite momentum grid. Another issue we investigate is the location on the diagonal of the Hamiltonian in momentum-space where the SRG evolution places the Deuteron bound-state eigenvalue once it reaches the fixed point. This finite momentum grid setup provides an alternative derivation of the celebrated trace identities, as a by product. The different effects due to either the Wilson or the Wegner generators on the binding energies of A=2,3,4 systems are investigated and related to the occurrence of a Tjon-line which emerges as the minimum of an avoided crossing between Eα=4Et−3Ed and Eα=2Et .

16751,2,"Zitterbewegung, internal momentum and spin of the circular travelling-wave electromagnetic model electron This study demonstrates that an electron, going round, with tangential velocity c , in a circle of radius equal to half the reduced Compton wavelength of the electron, has Dirac-delta-like internal momentum ( $u,\overrightarrow{p}_{\theta}$ ). The circular momentum $ \overrightarrow{p}_{\theta}$ and energy u emanate from the circular Dirac-delta-type rotating monochromatic electromagnetic (EM) wave, which travels itself in another circle having radius equal to the reduced Compton wavelength of the electron. The phenomenon of Zitterbewegung and the spin of the electron are natural consequences of the model. The spin is associated with the internal circulating momentum of the electron in terms of a four-component spinor, which leads to the Dirac equation linking the EM electron model with quantum-mechanical theory. Our model accurately explains the experimental results of the electron channelling experiment (P. Catillon et al., Found.

Thermal characteristics of the levitating rotor in the SMB are important to reduce the detector noise. We have constructed two types of SMB systems that both employ a NdFeB permanent magnet as a rotor and a YBCO superconductor array as a stator. One is the 1/6 scale prototype model and the other one is the flight representative full-scale prototype. In order to build a thermal model of the SMB system, we estimate thermal properties of a NdFeB magnet based on the measured data using the 1/6 scale prototype model. The thermal model is expanded to the full-scale prototype, and we obtained the requirement of heat loads from the SMB system is to be less than 1 mW. We also measured the thermal conductivity between the levitating rotor and a holder mechanism, which is the thermal path when the rotor is held in place at the time of field cooling.

These plastics are also known organic scintillators with very good scintillation properties. As particle physics experiments increase in energy and particle flux density, so does radiation exposure to detector materials.

16877,2,"PBH abundance from random Gaussian curvature perturbations and a local density threshold The production rate of primordial black holes is often calculated by considering a nearly Gaussian distribution of cosmological perturbations, and assuming that black holes will form in regions where the amplitude of such perturbations exceeds a certain threshold. A threshold $\zeta_{\rm th}$ for the curvature perturbation is somewhat inappropriate for this purpose, because it depends significantly on environmental effects, not essential to the local dynamics. By contrast, a threshold $\delta_{\rm th}$ for the density perturbation at horizon crossing seems to provide a more robust criterion. On the other hand, the density perturbation is known to be bounded above by a maximum limit $\delta_{\rm max}$, and given that $\delta_{\rm th}$ is comparable to $\delta_{\rm max}$, the density perturbation will be far from Gaussian near or above the threshold. In this paper we provide a new plausible estimate for the primordial black hole abundance based on peak theory. In our approach, we assume a Gaussian distribution for the curvature perturbation, while an optimized criterion for PBH formation is imposed, based on the locally averaged density perturbation around the nearly spherically symmetric high peaks. Both variables are related by the full nonlinear expression derived in the long-wavelength approximation of general relativity. We find that the mass spectrum is shifted to larger mass scales by one order of magnitude or so, compared to a conventional calculation. The abundance of PBHs becomes significantly larger than the conventional one, by many orders of magnitude, mainly due to the optimized criterion for PBH formation.",1

Rev. B 47, 7312 (1993)PRBMDO1098-012110.1103/PhysRevB.47.7312]. Specifically, we study a system consisting of alternating quasi-one-dimensional strips of composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and composite hole liquid (CHL), both of which break particle-hole symmetry. When the CFL and CHL strips are identical in size, the resulting state is manifestly invariant under the combined action of a particle-hole transformation with respect to a single Landau level (which interchanges the CFL and CHL) and translation by one unit, equal to the strip width, in the direction transverse to the strips. At distances long compared to the strip width, we demonstrate that the system is described by a Dirac fermion coupled to an emergent gauge field, with an antiunitary particle-hole symmetry, as recently proposed by Son [Phys.

16969,2,"Stability of Differentially Rotating Disks in $f(T)$ Theory To explain the accelerated expansion of our universe, many dark energy models and modified gravity theories have been proposed so far. It is argued in the literature that they are difficult to be distinguished on the cosmological scales. Therefore, it is well motivated to consider the relevant astrophysical phenomena on (or below) the galactic scales. In this work, we study the stability of self-gravitating differentially rotating galactic disks in f(T) theory, and obtain the local stability criteria in f(T) theory, which are valid for all f(T) theories satisfying $f(T=0)=0$ and $f_T (T=0)\not =0$ , if the adiabatic approximation and the weak field limit are considered. The information of the function f(T) is mainly encoded in the parameter $\alpha \equiv 1/f_T(T=0)$ . We find that the local stability criteria in f(T) theory are quite different from the ones in Newtonian gravity, general relativity, and other modified gravity theories such as f(R) theory. We consider that this might be a possible hint to distinguish f(T) theory from general relativity and other modified gravity theories on (or below) the galactic scales.",1

Here, we perform the first extensive comparison of such an EOBNR model to 70 precessing NR waveforms that span mass ratios from 1 to 5, dimensionless spin magnitudes up to 0.5, generic spin orientations, and length of about 20 orbits. We work in the observer’s inertial frame and include all ℓ=2 modes in the gravitational-wave polarizations. We introduce new prescriptions for the EOB ringdown signal concerning its spectrum and time of onset. For total masses between 10M⊙ and 200M⊙, we find that precessing EOBNR waveforms have unfaithfulness within about 3% to NR waveforms when considering the Advanced-LIGO design noise curve. This result is obtained without recalibration of the inspiral-plunge signal of the underlying nonprecessing EOBNR model. The unfaithfulness is computed with maximization over time and phase of arrival, sky location, and polarization of the EOBNR waveform, and it is averaged over sky location and polarization of the NR signal. We also present comparisons between NR and EOBNR waveforms in a frame that tracks the orbital precession.",1

They are to be found in a great variety of objects and environments: magnetospheric and heliospheric shocks, supernova remnants, pulsar winds and their nebul\ae, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts and clusters of galaxies shock waves. Collisionless shock microphysics enters at different stages of shock formation, shock dynamics and particle energization and/or acceleration. It turns out that the shock phenomenon is a multi-scale non-linear problem in time and space. It is complexified by the impact due to high-energy cosmic rays in astrophysical environments. This review adresses the physics of shock formation, shock dynamics and particle acceleration based on a close examination of available multi-wavelength or in-situ observations, analytical and numerical developments. A particular emphasize is made on the different instabilities triggered during the shock formation and in association with particle acceleration processes with regards to the properties of the background upstream medium. It appears that among the most important parameters the background magnetic field through the magnetization and its obliquity is the dominant one. The shock velocity that can reach relativistic speeds has also a strong impact over the development of the micro-instabilities and the fate of particle acceleration. Recent developments of laboratory shock experiments has started to bring some new insights in the physics of space plasma and astrophysical shock waves.

17101,2,"Extended I-Love relations for slowly rotating neutron stars Observations of gravitational waves from inspiralling neutron star binaries—such as GW170817—can be used to constrain the nuclear equation of state by placing bounds on stellar tidal deformability. For slowly rotating neutron stars, the response to a weak quadrupolar tidal field is characterized by four internal-structure-dependent constants called “Love numbers.” The tidal Love numbers k2el and k2mag measure the tides raised by the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic components of the applied field, and the rotational-tidal Love numbers fo and ko measure those raised by couplings between the applied field and the neutron star spin. In this work, we compute these four Love numbers for perfect fluid neutron stars with realistic equations of state. We discover (nearly) equation-of-state independent relations between the rotational-tidal Love numbers and the moment of inertia, thereby extending the scope of I-Love-Q universality. We find that similar relations hold among the tidal and rotational-tidal Love numbers. These relations extend the applications of I-Love universality in gravitational-wave astronomy.

17302,2,"Bound-States Dynamics in One-Dimensional Multi-Species Fermionic Systems In this work we provide for a description of the low-energy physics of interacting multispecies fermions in terms of the bound states that are stabilized in these systems when a spin gap opens. We argue that at energies much smaller than the spin gap, these systems are described by a Luttinger liquid of bound states that depends, on top of the charge stiffness ν and the charge velocity u, on a “Fermi” momentum PF satisfying qPF=NkF where q is the charge of the bound state, N is the number of species, and kF is the Fermi momentum in the noninteracting limit. We further argue that for generic interactions, generic bound states are likely to be stabilized. They are associated with emergent, in general nonlocal, symmetries and are in the number of five. The first two consist of either a charge q=N local SU(N) singlet or a charge q=N bound state made of two local SU(p) and SU(N−p) singlets. In this case the Fermi momentum PF=kF is preserved. The three others have an enhanced Fermi vector PF. The latter are either charge q=2 bosonic p-wave and s-wave pairs with SO(N) and SP(N) symmetry and PF=NkF/2 or a composite fermion of charge q=1 with PF=NkF. The instabilities of these Luttinger liquid states towards incompressible phases and their possible topological nature are also discussed.",1
17307,2,"Expansion of magnetic neutron stars in an energy (in)dependent spacetime Regarding the strong magnetic field of neutron stars and the high-energy regime scenario that is based on the high-curvature region near the compact objects, one is motivated to study magnetic neutron stars in an energy-dependent spacetime. In this paper, we show that such a strong magnetic field and energy dependency of spacetime have considerable effects on the properties of neutron stars. We examine the variations of maximum mass and related radius, Schwarzschild radius, average density, gravitational redshift, Kretschmann scalar, and Buchdahl theorem due to the magnetic field and energy dependency of the metric. First, it will be shown that the maximum mass and radius of neutron stars are increasing functions of the magnetic field, while average density, redshift, strength of gravity, and Kretschmann scalar are decreasing functions of it. These results are due to a repulsive-like force behavior for the magnetic field. Next, the effects of gravity’s rainbow will be studied, and it will be shown that by increasing the rainbow function, the neutron stars could enjoy an expansion in their structures. Then, we obtain a new relation for the upper mass limit of a static spherical neutron star with uniform density in gravity’s rainbow (Buchdahl limit) in which such an upper limit is modified as ${M}_{\mathrm{eff}}\lt \tfrac{4{c}^{2}R}{9G}$. In addition, stability and energy conditions for the equation of state of neutron star matter are investigated, and a comparison with empirical results is done. It is notable that the numerical study in this paper is conducted by using the lowest-order constrained variational approach in the presence of a magnetic field employing AV (18) potential.",1
17352,2,"Measurement of Each 324 MHz Micro Pulse Stripping Efficiency for H⁻ Laser Stripping Experiment in J-PARC RCS In 3-GeV RCS of J-PARC, an experiment for H⁻ stripping to protons by using lasers is under preparation. The experiment requires measurements of all three charge fractions of each 324 MHz H-μpulse in the downstream of laser and H⁻ interaction point (IP). However, at the first stage, only a single H-μpulse is aimed to strip by using lasers. It is therefore very essential to establish a new measurement method for that purpose, which has not yet been studied anywhere in that direction. We consider measuring BPM (beam position monitor) pickup signal by using an oscilloscope of 4 GHz bandwidth and sampling rate no less than 1TS/s. To test the system, we have done some experimental studies, where beam halo scrapper (carbon foil), placed at the L-3BT (linac to 3-GeV beam transport) is used for H⁻ stripping. The unstripped H⁻ and the stripped protons separated by a bending magnet in the downstream of the scrapper are simultaneously measured by two BPMs in two beam lines. The H-μpulses were clearly measured with good resolution, where a ratio of the pulses without and with scrapper gives the stripping efficiency. A detail of the present study results are presented.",1
17374,2,"The influence of neutrinos on r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejecta of black hole–neutron star mergers During the merger of a black hole and a neutron star, baryonic mass can become unbound from the system. Because the ejected material is extremely neutron-rich, the r-process rapidly synthesizes heavy nuclides as the material expands and cools. In this work, we map general relativistic models of black hole–neutron star mergers into a Newtonian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code and follow the evolution of the thermodynamics and morphology of the ejecta until the outflows become homologous. We investigate how the subsequent evolution depends on our mapping procedure and find that the results are robust. Using thermodynamic histories from the SPH particles, we then calculate the expected nucleosynthesis in these outflows while varying the level of neutrino irradiation coming from the post-merger accretion disc. We find that the ejected material robustly produces r-process nucleosynthesis even for unrealistically high neutrino luminosities, due to the rapid velocities of the outflow. None the less, we find that neutrinos can have an impact on the detailed pattern of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Electron neutrinos are captured by neutrons to produce protons while neutron capture is occurring. The produced protons rapidly form low-mass seed nuclei for the r-process. These low-mass seeds are eventually incorporated into the first r-process peak at A ∼ 78. We consider the mechanism of this process in detail and discuss if it can impact galactic chemical evolution of the first peak r-process nuclei.",1

17383,2,"Equation of state of dense nuclear matter and neutron star structure from nuclear chiral interactions Aims. We report a new microscopic equation of state (EOS) of dense symmetric nuclear matter, pure neutron matter, and asymmetric and β-stable nuclear matter at zero temperature using recent realistic two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived in the framework of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and including the Δ(1232) isobar intermediate state. This EOS is provided in tabular form and in parametrized form ready for use in numerical general relativity simulations of binary neutron star merging. Here we use our new EOS for β-stable nuclear matter to compute various structural properties of non-rotating neutron stars.Methods. The EOS is derived using the Brueckner–Bethe–Goldstone quantum many-body theory in the Brueckner–Hartree–Fock approximation. Neutron star properties are next computed solving numerically the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkov structure equations. Results. Our EOS models are able to reproduce the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter, the symmetry energy Esym, and its slope parameter L at the empirical saturation density n0. In addition, our EOS models are compatible with experimental data from collisions between heavy nuclei at energies ranging from a few tens of MeV up to several hundreds of MeV per nucleon. These experiments provide a selective test for constraining the nuclear EOS up to ~4n0. Our EOS models are consistent with present measured neutron star masses and particularly with the mass M = 2.01 ± 0.04 M⊙ of the neutron stars in PSR J0348+0432.

17507,2,"Verification of passive cooling techniques in the Super-FRS beam collimators The Super FRagment Separator (Super-FRS) at the FAIR facility will be the largest in-flight separator of heavy ions in the world. One of the essential steps in the separation procedure is to stop the unwanted ions with beam collimators. In one of the most common situations, the heavy ions are produced by a fission reaction of a primary (238)U-beam (1.5 GeV/u) hitting a (12)C target (2.5 g/cm2). In this situation, some of the produced ions are highly charged states of (238)U. These ions can reach the collimators with energies of up to 1.3 GeV/u and a power of up to 500 W. Under these conditions, a cooling system is required to prevent damage to the collimators and to the corresponding electronics. Due to the highly radioactive environment, both the collimators and the cooling system must be suitable for robot handling. Therefore, an active cooling system is undesirable because of the increased possibility of malfunctioning and other complications. By using thermal simulations (performed with NX9 of Siemens PLM), the possibility of passive cooling is explored. The validity of these simulations is tested by independent comparison with other simulation programs and by experimental verification. The experimental verification is still under analysis, but preliminary results indicate that the explored passive cooling option provides sufficient temperature reduction.",1

17529,2,"Scenarios for ultrafast gamma-ray variability in AGN We analyze three scenarios to address the challenge of ultrafast gamma-ray variability reported from active galactic nuclei. We focus on the energy requirements imposed by these scenarios: (i) external cloud in the jet, (ii) relativistic blob propagating through the jet material, and (iii) production of high-energy gamma-rays in the magnetosphere gaps. We show that while the first two scenarios are not constrained by the flare luminosity, there is a robust upper limit on the luminosity of flares generated in the black hole magnetosphere. This limit depends weakly on the mass of the central black hole and is determined by the accretion disk magnetization, viewing angle, and the pair multiplicity. For the most favorable values of these parameters, the luminosity for 5-minute flares is limited by $2\times {10}^{43}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$, which excludes a black hole magnetosphere origin of the flare detected from IC 310. In the scopes of scenarios (i) and (ii), the jet power, which is required to explain the IC 310 flare, exceeds the jet power estimated based on the radio data. To resolve this discrepancy in the framework of scenario (ii), it is sufficient to assume that the relativistic blobs are not distributed isotropically in the jet reference frame. A realization of scenario (i) demands that the jet power during the flare exceeds by a factor 10(2) the power of the radio jet relevant to a timescale of 10(8) years.",1
17612,2,"Bringing Experiment Software to the Web with VISPA The Visual Physics Analysis (VISPA) software is a toolbox for accessing analysis software via the web.

We present the techniques of the extension mechanism and corresponding applications.",1
17703,2,"Geodesic motion in a stationary dihole spacetime The knowledge of the properties of the different exact solutions modeling binary systems is a necessary step toward the classification of physically suitable solutions and its corresponding limits of applicability. In the present paper, we perform an analysis of the geodesics around two counter-rotating Kerr-Newman black holes endowed with opposite electric charges, which achieve equilibrium by means of a strut between their constituents. We find that bounded and unbounded orbits are possible. However, test particles may cross between the black holes only if their angular momentum equals zero; otherwise, there exists a repulsive potential, which prohibits such orbits. Two important aspects are pointed out for these trajectories: (i) the motion of photons is affected once it has crossed the strut, and (ii) massive particles exhibit oscillatory motion, as a first analog of the Sitnikov problem in general relativity. The radius of the innermost stable circular orbit as a function of the physical parameters of the black holes is also investigated.",1
17769,2,"Performance of the high-efficiency thermal neutron BAND-GEM detector New high-count-rate detectors are required for future spallation neutron sources where large-area and high-efficiency (>50%) detectors are envisaged. In this framework, Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is one of the detectortechnologies being explored, since it features good spatial resolution ( < 0.5 cm) and timing properties, has excellent rate capability (MHz/mm 2) and can cover large areas (some m 2) at low cost. In the BAND-GEM (boron array neutron detector GEM) approach a 3D geometry for the neutron converter cathode was developed that is expected to provide an efficiency > 30% in the wavelength range of interest for small angle neutron scattering instruments. A system of aluminum grids with thin walls coated with a 0.59 μ m layer of 10 B 4 C has been built and positioned in the first detector gap, orthogonally to the cathode. By tilting the grid system with respect to the beam, there is a significant increase of effective thickness of the borated material crossed by the neutrons. As a consequence, both interaction probability and detection efficiency are increased. This paper presents the results of the performance of the BAND-GEM detector in terms of efficiency and spatial resolution.",1

Thanks to consistently tuned star formation rate and supernovae feedback, we manage to obtain an extended disk and a flat rotation curve with the circular velocity and the dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood in agreement with observations. With a careful look at the derivation of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, we also obtain competitive values for this criterion. Concerning the dark matter distribution, we explicitly show the interaction with the baryons and show how the dark matter is first contracted by star formation and then cored by feedback processes. In this consistent framework, we also study dark matter detection phenomenology which will be the subject of subsequent papers.",1

Repulsion (deceleration) for ingoing particles into a black hole is a concept proposed several times starting from Droste himself in 1916. It is a coordinate effect appearing to an observer at a remote distance from the black hole and when coordinate time is employed. Repulsion has no bearing and relation to the local physics of the black hole, and moreover it cannot be held responsible for accelerating outgoing particles. Thereby, the energy boost of cosmic rays cannot be produced by repulsion.",1

18017,2,"Geometric Time and Causal Time in Relativistic Lagrangian Mechanics In this article, we argue that two distinct types of time should be taken into account in relativistic physics: a geometric time, which emanates from the structure of spacetime and its metrics, and a causal time, indicating the flow from the past to the future. A particularity of causal times is that its values have no intrinsic meaning, as their evolution alone is meaningful. In the context of relativistic Lagrangian mechanics, causal times corresponds to admissible parameterizations of paths, and we show that in order for a langragian to not depend on any particular causal time (as its values have no intrinsic meaning), it has to be homogeneous in its velocity argument. We illustrate this property with the example of a free particle in a potential. Then, using a geometric Lagrangian (i.e. a parameterization independent Lagrangian which is also manifestly covariant), we introduce the notion of ageodesicity of a path which measures to what extent a path is far from being a geodesic, and show how the notion can be used in the twin paradox to differentiate the paths followed by the two twins.",1
18063,2,"A Prototype Scalable Readout System for Micro-pattern Gas Detectors A scalable readout system (SRS) is designed to provide a general solution for different micro-pattern gas detectors in various applications.

The ASIC cards, mounted with particular ASIC chips, are designed for receiving detector signals. The adapter card is in charge of digitizing the output signals from several ASIC cards. The FEC, edged-mounted with the adapter, has field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based reconfigurable logic and I/O interfaces, allowing users to choose different ASIC cards and adapters for different experiments, which expands the system to various applications.

We excise regions of the sky that define position of the known point sources, regions that are strongly contaminated by either the detector noise or by the diffuse foregrounds or both, and then perform foreground minimizations over the surviving sky regions that constitute approximately $50\%$ of the full sky area. We critically evaluate performance of foreground minimizations in several ways and show that our foreground minimization method removes significant foregrounds from input maps. The cleaned Stokes \{Q, U\} polarization maps have less EE and BB power from relevant sky region compared to WMAP foreground-reduced Stokes \{Q, U\} polarization maps at different multipole ranges. We validate our methodology by performing detailed Monte Carlo simulations. The main driving machinery of our method is an internal-linear-combination (ILC) approach, however, unlike simple variance minimization performed in usual ILC method, the core of the method being dependent on the theoretically well motivated concept of Gaussianity of CMB polarization a direct connection is established between observations and models of inflation. Additionally, the method, like the usual ILC method, is independent on modeling uncertainties of polarized foregrounds. It will be useful to apply our method in future generation low-noise CMB polarization experiments.",1
18359,2,"Covariant Hyperbolization of Force-free Electrodynamics Force-free electrodynamics (FFE) is a nonlinear system of equations modeling the evolution of the electromagnetic field, in the presence of a magnetically dominated relativistic plasma. This configuration arises on several astrophysical scenarios which represent exciting laboratories to understand physics in extreme regimes. We show that this system, when restricted to the correct constraint submanifold, is symmetric hyperbolic. In numerical applications, it is not feasible to keep the system in that submanifold, and so it is necessary to analyze its structure first in the tangent space of that submanifold and then in a whole neighborhood of it. As has been shown [1], a direct (or naive) formulation of this system (in the whole tangent space) results in a weakly hyperbolic system of evolution equations for which well-posedness for the initial value formulation does not follow. Using the generalized symmetric hyperbolic formalism of Geroch [2], we introduce here a covariant hyperbolization for the FFE system. In fact, in analogy to the usual Maxwell case, a complete family of hyperbolizers is found, both for the restricted system on the constraint submanifold as well as for a suitably extended system defined in a whole neighborhood of it. A particular symmetrizer among the family is then used to write down the pertaining evolution equations, in a generic (3+1) decomposition on a background spacetime. Interestingly, it turns out that for a particular choice of the lapse and shift functions of the foliation, our symmetrized system reduces to the one found in [1]. Finally, we analyze the characteristic structure of the resulting evolution system.",1

18583,2,"Delayed light emission of Tetraphenyl-butadiene excited by liquid argon scintillation light. Current status and future plans Tetraphenyl-butadiene is the wavelength shifter most widely used in combination with liquid argon. The latter emits scintillation photons with a wavelength of 127 nm that need to be downshifted to be detected by photomultipliers with glass or quartz windows. Tetraphenyl-butadiene has been demonstrated to have an extremely high conversion efficiency, possibly higher than 100% for 127 nm photons, while there is no precise information about the time dependence of its emission. It is usually assumed to be exponentially decaying with a characteristic time of the order of one ns, as an extrapolation from measurements with exciting radiation in the near UV . This work shows that tetraphenyl-butadiene, when excited by 127 nm photons, re-emits photons not only with a very short decay time, but also with slower ones due to triplet states de-excitations. This fact can strongly contribute to clarifying the anomalies in liquid-argon scintillation light reported in the literature since the 1970s. Precision measurements of the properties of TPB, when excited by Vacuum Ultra Violet photons are being carried on at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory in Campinas (State of São Paulo).",1
18585,2,"Triplet Pairing in pure neutron matter We study the zero-temperature BCS gaps for the triplet channel in pure neutron matter using similarity renormalization group (SRG) evolved interactions. We use the dependence of the results on the SRG resolution scale as a tool to analyze medium and many-body corrections. In particular, we study the effects of including the three-body interactions at leading order, which appear at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO) in the chiral effective field theory (EFT), as well as that of the first-order self-energy corrections on the zero-temperature gap. In addition we also extract the transition temperature as a function of densities and verify the BCS scaling of the zero-temperature gaps to the transition temperature. We observe that the self-energy effects are very crucial in order to reduce the SRG resolution scale dependence of the results, while the three-body effects at the leading order do not change the two-body resolution scale dependence. On the other hand, the results depend strongly on the three-body cutoff, emphasizing the importance of the missing higher-order three-body effects. We also observe that self-energy effects reduce the overall gap as well as shift the gap closure to lower densities.",1

18722,2,"Cosmic acceleration from a single fluid description We here propose a new class of barotropic factor for matter, motivated by properties of isotropic deformations of crystalline solids. Our approach is dubbed Anton–Schmidt’s equation of state and provides a non-vanishing, albeit small, pressure term for matter. The corresponding pressure is thus proportional to the logarithm of universe’s volume, i.e. to the density itself since V∝ρ−1 . In the context of solid state physics, we demonstrate that by only invoking standard matter with such a property, we are able to frame the universe speed up in a suitable way, without invoking a dark energy term by hand. Our model extends a recent class of dark energy paradigms named logotropic dark fluids and depends upon two free parameters, namely n and B . Within the Debye approximation, we find that n and B are related to the Grüneisen parameter and the bulk modulus of crystals. We thus show the main differences between our model and the logotropic scenario, and we highlight the most relevant properties of our new equation of state on the background cosmology. Discussions on both kinematics and dynamics of our new model have been presented. We demonstrate that the Λ CDM model is inside our approach, as limiting case. Comparisons with CPL parametrization have been also reported in the text. Finally, a Monte Carlo analysis on the most recent low-redshift cosmological data allowed us to place constraints on n and B . In particular, we found n=−0.147−0.107+0.113 and B=3.54×10−3 .",1

Within the scenario of a $k=0-$ spatially-flat geometry, we analysed the geometrodynamics of the theoretical cosmology. For the model with an added cosmological constant, the main scope was to point out the effects of it on the universe' dynamics. In this last case, the thermodynamics of the model was also considered together with the relation between the cosmological energy density and fluid pressure in terms of the inverse function of the equation of state.",1

The measurements were performed for two otherwise identical LOS detectors only differing in wall materials of the sensitive volume: acryl versus stainless steel.

To address this question, we critically reexamine the arguments that led to the ""Buchdahl bound"", which implies that the minimal size of a stable, compact object must be larger than nine eighths of its own Schwarzschild radius. Following Mazur and Mottola, and in line with other counterexamples to the singularity theorems, we identify negative radial pressure as the essential ingredient for evading the Buchdahl bound. It is shown, in particular, that an external observer would attribute a negative pressure to a Schwarzschild-sized bound state of highly excited, long, closed, interacting strings and thus the ability to resist gravitational collapse.",1
18899,2,"The role of weak interactions in dynamic ejecta from binary neutron star mergers Weak reactions are critical for the neutron richness of the matter dynamically ejected after the merger of two neutron stars. The neutron richness, defined by the electron fraction (), determines which heavy elements are produced by the r-process and thus directly impacts the kilonova light curve. In this work, we have performed a systematic and detailed post-processing study of the impact of weak reactions on the distribution of the electron fraction and of the entropy on the dynamic ejecta obtained from an equal mass neutron star binary merger simulated in full general relativity and with microscopic equation of state. Previous investigations indicated that shocks increase , however our results show that shocks can also decrease , depending on their thermodynamical conditions. Moreover, we have found that neutrino absorption is key and need to be considered in future simulations. We also demonstrated that the angular dependence of the neutrino luminosity and the spatial distribution of the ejecta can lead to significant difference in the electron fraction distribution. In addition to the detailed study of the evolution and its dependences, we have performed nucleosynthesis calculations. They clearly point to the necessity of improving the neutrino treatment in current simulations to be able to predict the contribution of neutron star mergers to the chemical history of the universe and to reliable calculate their kilonova light curves.",1
18921,2,"A Note on the Problem of Proper Time in Weyl Space–Time We discuss the question of whether or not a general Weyl structure is a suitable mathematical model of space–time. This is an issue that has been in debate since Weyl formulated his unified field theory for the first time. We do not present the discussion from the point of view of a particular unification theory, but instead from a more general standpoint, in which the viability of such a structure as a model of space–time is investigated. Our starting point is the well known axiomatic approach to space–time given by Elhers, Pirani and Schild (EPS). In this framework, we carry out an exhaustive analysis of what is required for a consistent definition for proper time and show that such a definition leads to the prediction of the so-called “second clock effect”. We take the view that if, based on experience, we were to reject space–time models predicting this effect, this could be incorporated as the last axiom in the EPS approach. Finally, we provide a proof that, in this case, we are led to a Weyl integrable space–time as the most general structure that would be suitable to model space–time.",1
19241,2,"Multiband variability studies and novel broadband SED modeling of Mrk 501 in 2009 Context. We present an extensive study of the BL Lac object Mrk 501 based on a data set collected during the multi-instrument campaign spanning from 2009 March 15 to 2009 August 1, which includes, among other instruments, MAGIC, VERITAS, Whipple 10 m, and Fermi-LAT to cover the γ-ray range from 0.1 GeV to 20 TeV; RXTE and Swift to cover wavelengths from UV tohard X-rays; and GASP-WEBT, which provides coverage of radio and optical wavelengths. Optical polarization measurements were provided for a fraction of the campaign by the Steward and St. Petersburg observatories. We evaluate the variability of the source and interband correlations, the γ-ray flaring activity occurring in May 2009, and interpret the results within two synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenarios. Aims. The multiband variability observed during the full campaign is addressed in terms of the fractional variability, and the possible correlations are studied by calculating the discrete correlation function for each pair of energy bands where the significance was evaluated with dedicated Monte Carlo simulations. The space of SSC model parameters is probed following a dedicated grid-scan strategy, allowing for a wide range of models to be tested and offering a study of the degeneracy of model-to-data agreement in the individual model parameters, hence providing a less biased interpretation than the “single-curve SSC model adjustment” typically reported in the literature. Methods. We find an increase in the fractional variability with energy, while no significant interband correlations of flux changes are found on the basis of the acquired data set. The SSC model grid-scan shows that the flaring activity around May 22 cannot be modeled adequately with a one-zone SSC scenario (using an electron energy distribution with two breaks), while it can be suitably described within a two (independent) zone SSC scenario. Here, one zone is responsible for the quiescent emission from the averaged 4.5-month observing period, while the other one, which is spatially separated from the first, dominates the flaring emission occurring at X-rays and very-high-energy (>100 GeV, VHE) γ rays. The flaring activity from May 1, which coincides with a rotation of the electric vector polarization angle (EVPA), cannot be satisfactorily reproduced by either a one-zone or a two-independent-zone SSC model, yet this is partially affected by the lack of strictly simultaneous observations and the presence of large flux changes on sub-hour timescales (detected at VHE γ rays). Results. The higher variability in the VHE emission and lack of correlation with the X-ray emission indicate that, at least during the 4.5-month observing campaign in 2009, the highest energy (and most variable) electrons that are responsible for the VHE γ rays do not make a dominant contribution to the ~1 keV emission. Alternatively, there could be a very variable component contributing to the VHE γ-ray emission in addition to that coming from the SSC scenario. The studies with our dedicated SSC grid-scan show that there is some degeneracy in both the one-zone and the two-zone SSC scenarios probed, with several combinations of model parameters yielding a similar model-to-data agreement, and some parameters better constrained than others. The observed γ-ray flaring activity, with the EVPA rotation coincident with the first γ-ray flare, resembles those reported previously for low frequency peaked blazars, hence suggesting that there are many similarities in the flaring mechanisms of blazars with different jet properties.

When such quasiparticles interact with gapless bosonic degrees of freedom that mediate either the long-range Coulomb interaction or its short range component (responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking), in the deep infrared or quantum critical regime in two dimensions the system is respectively described by a \emph{marginal-} or a \emph{non-Fermi liquid} of relativistic spin-1/2 fermions (possessing a \emph{unique} velocity), and is always a \emph{marginal Fermi liquid} in three dimensions.

Non-thermal X-ray emission from XMMU J183245−0921539, the X-ray source associated with HESS J1832−093, is detected up to ∼30 keV and is well-described by an absorbed power-law model with a best-fit photon index ${\rm{\Gamma }}=1.5\pm 0.1$. A re-analysis of archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data finds that the long-term X-ray flux increase of XMMU J183245−0921539 is ${50}_{-20}^{+40} \% $ (90% C.L.), much less than previously reported.

19619,2,"Constraining f(R) Gravity with Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Clusters Clusters of galaxies have the potential of providing powerful constraints on possible deviations from General Relativity. We use the catalog of Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) sources detected by Planck and consider a correction to the halo mass function for a f(R) class of modified gravity models, which has been recently found to reproduce well results from N-body simulations, to place constraints on the scalaron field amplitude at the present time, fR0. We find that applying this correction to different calibrations of the halo mass function produces upper bounds on fR0 tighter by more than an order of magnitude, ranging from log10(-fR0)<-5.81 to log10(-fR0)<-4.40 (95% confidence level). This sensitivity is due to the different shape of the halo mass function, which is degenerate with the parameters used to calibrate the scaling relations between SZ observables and cluster masses. Any claim of constraints more stringent that the weaker limit above, based on cluster number counts, appears to be premature and must be supported by a careful calibration of the halo mass function and by a robust calibration of the mass scaling relations.",1
19670,2,"Can a quantum critical state represent a blackbody? The blackbody theory of Planck played a seminal role in the development of quantum theory at the turn of the past century. A blackbody cavity is generally thought to be a collection of photons in thermal equilibrium; the radiation emitted is at all wavelengths, and the intensity follows a scaling law, which is Planck’s characteristic distribution law. These photons arise from non-interacting normal modes. Here we suggest that certain quantum critical states when heated emit “radiation” at all wavelengths and satisfy all the criteria of a blackbody. An important difference is that the “radiation” does not necessarily consist of non-interacting photons, but also emergent relativistic bosons or fermions. The examples we provide include emergent relativistic fermions at a topological quantum critical point. This perspective on a quantum critical state may be illuminating in many unforeseen ways.",1
19713,2,"Are There Testable Discrete Poincaré Invariant Physical Theories? In a model of physics taking place on a discrete set of points that approximates Minkowski space, one might perhaps expect there to be an empirically identifiable preferred frame. However, the work of Dowker, Bombelli, Henson, and Sorkin might be taken to suggest that random sprinklings of points in Minkowski space define a discrete model that is provably Poincar\'e invariant in a natural sense. We examine this possibility here. We argue that a genuinely Poincar\'e invariant model requires a probability distribution on sprinklable sets -- Poincar\'e orbits of sprinklings -- rather than individual sprinklings. The corresponding $\sigma$-algebra contains only sets of measure zero or one. This makes testing the hypothesis of discrete Poincar\'e invariance problematic, since any local violation of Poincar\'e invariance, however gross and large scale, is possible, and cannot be said to be improbable. We also note that the Bombelli-Henson-Sorkin argument, which rules out constructions of preferred timelike directions for typical sprinklings, is not sufficient to establish full Lorentz invariance. For example, once a pair of timelike separated points is fixed, a preferred spacelike direction {\it can} be defined for a typical sprinkling, breaking the remaining rotational invariance.",1
19724,2,"Storage quality-of-service in cloud-based scientific environments: a standardization approach When preparing the Data Management Plan for larger scientific endeavors, PIs have to balance between the most appropriate qualities of storage space along the line of the planned data life-cycle, its price and the available funding. Storage properties can be the media type, implicitly determining access latency and durability of stored data, the number and locality of replicas, as well as available access protocols or authentication mechanisms. Negotiations between the scientific community and the responsible infrastructures generally happen upfront, where the amount of storage space, media types, like: disk, tape and SSD and the foreseeable data life-cycles are negotiated. With the introduction of cloud management platforms, both in computing and storage, resources can be brokered to achieve the best price per unit of a given quality. However, in order to allow the platform orchestrator to programmatically negotiate the most appropriate resources, a standard vocabulary for different properties of resources and a commonly agreed protocol to communicate those, has to be available. In order to agree on a basic vocabulary for storage space properties, the storage infrastructure group in INDIGO-DataCloud together with INDIGO-associated and external scientific groups, created a working group under the umbrella of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). As communication protocol, to query and negotiate storage qualities, the Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI) has been selected. Necessary extensions to CDMI are defined in regular meetings between INDIGO and the Storage Network Industry Association (SNIA). Furthermore, INDIGO is contributing to the SNIA CDMI reference implementation as the basis for interfacing the various storage systems in INDIGO to the agreed protocol and to provide an official Open-Source skeleton for systems not being maintained by INDIGO partners.",1
19759,2,"Open Microwave Cavity for use in a Purcell Enhancement Cooling Scheme A microwave cavity is described which can be used to cool lepton plasmas for potential use in synthesis of antihydrogen. The cooling scheme is an incarnation of the Purcell effect: when plasmas are coupled to a microwave cavity, the plasma cooling rate is resonantly enhanced through increased spontaneous emission of cyclotron radiation. The cavity forms a three electrode section of a Penning-Malmberg trap and has a bulged cylindrical geometry with open ends aligned with the magnetic trapping axis. This allows plasmas to be injected and removed from the cavity without the need for moving parts while maintaining high quality factors for resonant modes. The cavity includes unique surface preparations for adjusting the cavity quality factor and achieving anti-static shielding using thin layers of nichrome and colloidal graphite, respectively. Geometric design considerations for a cavity with strong cooling power and low equilibrium plasma temperatures are discussed.

With experiments accessing the intricate dynamics of many-body quantum systems, it is paramount to develop powerful methods that encode the emergent physics. Up to now, the strong dichotomy observed between integrable and nonintegrable evolutions made an overarching theory difficult to build, especially for transport phenomena where space-time profiles are drastically different. We present a novel framework for studying transport in integrable systems: hydrodynamics with infinitely many conservation laws. This bridges the conceptual gap between integrable and nonintegrable quantum dynamics, and gives powerful tools for accurate studies of space-time profiles.

The statistical characteristics of these anisotropies allow constraining jointly the physics of the creation of the primordial fluctuations and that of their evolution. They teach us the possible value of the parameters of the models which we confront to data.

20163,2,"Quasifission and fission rates and their lifetimes in asymmetric reactions forming $^{216}$Ra within a dinuclear system approach Background: The study of evolution of asymmetric dinuclear systems (DNSs) formed in heavy ion collisions is a topic of intense research. The DNS evolution leads to a variety of reaction channels such as deep inelastic, complete fusion, quasifission, fast fission, fusion-fission, and evaporation of particles. The time evolution of the DNS in the quasifission process and the role of relevant parameters are still not fully understood. Purpose: The influence of the entrance channel mass asymmetry on the time evolution of an excited and rotating DNS, populated via four reactions with different entrance channel mass asymmetry parameters which all lead to the compound nucleus Ra216, is explored. Method: The driving potential, emission barriers for the binary decay (namely the quasifission and intrinsic fusion barriers), rate of the quasifission channel, and the lifetime of an excited DNS, as well as the fission rate and fission lifetime of the compound nucleus Ra216 formed in the C12+Pb204,F19+Au197,Si30+W186, and Ca48+Er168 reactions, are calculated by the dinuclear system approach. Results: Our results show that the intrinsic fusion barrier values are equal to zero for the C12+Pb204 and F19+Au197 reactions. Therefore, the quasifission signature is extremely hindered for these reactions, while the Si30+W186 and Ca48+Er168 calculated results contain quasifission contributions. Provided the quasifission rate is nonzero, the quasifission rate increases with increasing orbital angular momentum ℓ of the composite system for a given excitation energy ECN* of the compound nucleus. On the other hand, the quasifission lifetime decreases moderately with increasing ℓ. Furthermore, both quasifission and fission rates increase with increasing excitation energy ECN*, while the quasifission and fission lifetimes decrease with increasing ECN* for a given ℓ. Conclusions: Although these reactions with different entrance channels populate the same compound nucleus Ra216 at similar excitation energies, the fused system presents different behaviors for different entrance channel mass asymmetry parameters. In the Si30+W186 and Ca48+Er168 reactions having smaller entrance channel mass asymmetry, the quasifission signature dominates over the complete fusion process. Because of the small quasifission barrier for these reactions, the lifetime of the DNS is short and its EDNS* excitation energy is not sufficient to overcome the saddle point along the way to fusion. Instead, in the C12+Pb204 and F19+Au197 reaction systems, at EDNS* excitation energy higher than the threshold energy, the DNS has sufficient energy and time to reach a compound nucleus. In other words, the model calculations predict that the quasifission rate is negligible for the reactions with higher entrance channel mass asymmetry and complete fusion is a dominant decay channel.",1

20414,2,"A Hydrodynamic Approach to the Study of Anisotropic Instabilities in Dissipative Relativistic Plasmas We develop a purely hydrodynamic formalism to describe collisional, anisotropic instabilities in a relativistic plasma, that are usually described with kinetic theory tools. Our main motivation is the fact that coarse-grained models of high particle number systems give more clear and comprehensive physical descriptions of those systems than purely kinetic approaches, and can be more easily tested experimentally as well as numerically. Also they make it easier to follow perturbations from linear to nonlinear regimes. In particular, we aim at developing a theory that describes both a background nonequilibrium fluid configurations and its perturbations, to be able to account for the backreaction of the latter on the former. Our system of equations includes the usual conservation laws for the energy–momentum tensor and for the electric current, and the equations for two new tensors that encode the information about dissipation. To make contact with kinetic theory, we write the different tensors as the moments of a nonequilibrium one-particle distribution function (1pdf) which, for illustrative purposes, we take in the form of a Grad-like ansatz. Although this choice limits the applicability of the formalism to states not far from equilibrium, it retains the main features of the underlying kinetic theory. We assume the validity of the Vlasov–Boltzmann equation, with a collision integral given by the Anderson–Witting prescription, which is more suitable for highly relativistic systems than Marle’s (or Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook) form, and derive the conservation laws by taking its corresponding moments. We apply our developments to study the emergence of instabilities in an anisotropic, but axially symmetric background. For small departures of isotropy we find the dispersion relation for normal modes, which admit unstable solutions for a wide range of values of the parameter space.",1
20485,2,"Non-dipolarity of channeling radiation at GeV beam energies At electron-beam energies higher than about 1 GeV, the dipole approximation for channeling radiation (CR) loses its validity. The reason of non-dipolarity consists in the coupling of the longitudinal and transverse motions of the channeled particle, while, at lower energies, its transverse motion is assumed to be independent from the longitudinal one and is governed by the continuous potential only. The non-dipolarity of CR appears in a change of its energy spectrum and intensity.

20502,2,"High redshift BL Lac objects: spectroscopy of candidates We report on 16 BL Lacertae objects that were proposed to be at z > 1. We present spectroscopic observations secured at the 10.4m GTC that allowed us to assess the redshift of these sources. In particular, for five objects we disprove the previous value of the redshift reported in literature and found that they lie at z < 1. Moreover, two of them exhibit broad emission lines that are not characteristic of BL Lacertae object. On the other hand, for eight targets we improve the tentative value of z, previously based on only one feature, by detecting a number emission lines. Finally, in three cases we detect onset of Ly-{\alpha} forest at z > 2.50. Based on the new high quality spectra we found that only half of the observed objects can be classified as bona-fine BL Lacs.",1
20565,2,"Non-minimally coupled dark fluid in Schwarzschild spacetime If one assumes a particular form of non-minimal coupling, called the conformal coupling, of a perfect fluid with gravity in the fluid–gravity Lagrangian then one gets modified Einstein field equation. In the modified Einstein equation the effect of the non-minimal coupling does not vanish if one works with spacetimes for which the Ricci scalar vanishes. In the present work we use the Schwarzschild metric in the modified Einstein equation, in the presence of non-minimal coupling with a fluid, and find out the energy–density and pressure of the fluid. In the present case the perfect fluid is part of the solution of the modified Einstein equation. We also solve the modified Einstein equation, using the flat spacetime metric and show that in the presence of non-minimal coupling one can accommodate a perfect fluid of uniform energy–density and pressure in the flat spacetime. In both the cases the fluid pressure turns out to be negative. Except these non-trivial solutions it must be noted that the vacuum solutions also remain as trivial valid solutions of the modified Einstein equation in the presence of non-minimal coupling.",1
20690,2,"First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements Verlinde proposed that the observed excess gravity in galaxies and clusters is the consequence of emergent gravity (EG). In this theory, the standard gravitational laws are modified on galactic and larger scales due to the displacement of dark energy by baryonic matter. EG gives an estimate of the excess gravity (described as an apparent dark matter density) in terms of the baryonic mass distribution and the Hubble parameter. In this work, we present the first test of EG using weak gravitational lensing, within the regime of validity of the current model. Although there is no direct description of lensing and cosmology in EG yet, we can make a reasonable estimate of the expected lensing signal of low-redshift galaxies by assuming a background Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. We measure the (apparent) average surface mass density profiles of 33 613 isolated central galaxies and compare them to those predicted by EG based on the galaxies’ baryonic masses. To this end, we employ the ∼180 deg^2 overlap of the Kilo-Degree Survey with the spectroscopic Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey. We find that the prediction from EG, despite requiring no free parameters, is in good agreement with the observed galaxy–galaxy lensing profiles in four different stellar mass bins. Although this performance is remarkable, this study is only a first step. Further advancements on both the theoretical framework and observational tests of EG are needed before it can be considered a fully developed and solidly tested theory.",1
20716,2,"Metric Measure Space as a Framework for Gravitation In this manuscript, we show how conformal invariance can be incorporated in a classical theory of gravitation, in the context of metric measure space. Metric measure space involves a geometrical scalar f, dubbed as density function, which here appears as a conformal degree of freedom. In this framework, we present conformally invariant field equations, the relevant identities and geodesic equations. In metric measure space, the volume element and accordingly the operators with integral based definitions are modified. For instance, the divergence operator in this space differs from the Riemannian one. As a result, a gravitational theory formulated in this space has a generalized second Bianchi identity and a generalized conservation of energy-momentum tensor. It is shown how, by using the generalized identity for conservation of energy-momentum tensor, one can obtain a conformally invariant geodesic equation. By comparison of the geodesic equations in metric measure space with the Bohmian trajectories, in both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, a relation between density function f and the quantum potential is proposed. This suggests metric measure space to be considered as a suitable framework for geometric description of Bohm’s quantum mechanics. On the other hand, as it is known, Weyl geometry is one of the main approaches to construct conformally invariant gravitational models. Regarding the fact that the connection in the integrable Weyl space is modified and in metric measure space remains the same as it is in the Riemann space, the mathematical analogy between these two spaces is also discussed.",1

The first beam line is dedicated to BNCT. The second beam line is designed for research and development of neutron devices and neutron imaging. The neutrons used for the 2nd beam line are generated by using the (p, n) reaction of beryllium.

We obtain results that are consistent with the expectation from the best-fit Planck ΛCDM model over a range of multipoles L=80–2100, with an amplitude of lensing Alens=1.06±0.15(stat)±0.06(sys) relative to Planck. Our measurement of the CMB lensing power spectrum gives σ8Ωm0.25=0.643±0.054; including baryon acoustic oscillation scale data, we constrain the amplitude of density fluctuations to be σ8=0.831±0.053. We also update constraints on the neutrino mass sum. We verify our lensing measurement with a number of null tests and systematic checks, finding no evidence of significant systematic errors. This measurement relies on a small fraction of the ACTPol data already taken; more precise lensing results can therefore be expected from the full ACTPol data set.",1

The proofs given in the present article are completely algebraic and independent of any underlying topology. They are a generalization of the ones provided by Schlichenmaier, who proved the vanishing of the second cohomology group of the Witt and the Virasoro algebra by using purely algebraic methods.

O20(d,p)O21 transfer reactions are described using momentum-space Faddeev-type equations for transition operators and including the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 52+ and excited state 12+ are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ=0 and ℓ=2 , suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two- and three-body nature.",1

Depending on the type of measurement to be performed these cores require different magnetic characteristics for parameters such as permeability, coercivity and the shape of the magnetization curve. In order to study the effect of changes in these parameters on the current transformers, several interesting raw materials based on their as-cast properties were selected. The materials have been characterised to determine a suitable annealing processes to tailor their properties. As-cast properties such as the permeability, coercivity and Barkhausen noise have also been measured to enable the study of the effect of thermal treatment in the microstructure of the alloys, and the correlation of this with the change in the magnetic properties.

21005,2,"Symmetry-Protected Topological Interfaces and Entanglement Sequences Gapped interfaces (and boundaries) of two-dimensional (2D) Abelian topological phases are shown to support a remarkably rich sequence of 1D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. We show that such interfaces can provide a physical interpretation for the corrections to the topological entanglement entropy of a 2D state with Abelian topological order found in Ref. 29. The topological entanglement entropy decomposes as $\gamma = \gamma_a + \gamma_s$, where $\gamma_a$ only depends on universal topological properties of the 2D state, while a non-zero correction $\gamma_s$ signals the emergence of the 1D SPT state that is produced by interactions along the entanglement cut and provides a direct measure of the stabilizing symmetry of the resulting SPT state. A correspondence is established between the possible values of $\gamma_s$ associated with a given interface - which is named Boundary Topological Entanglement Sequence - and classes of 1D SPT states. We show that symmetry-preserving domain walls along such 1D interfaces (or boundaries) generally host localized parafermion-like excitations that are stable to local symmetry-preserving perturbations.",1

The Lie point symmetry is imposed to the system of Einstein field equations and unknown parameters are either determined or interrelated by the imposition of the symmetry. Subsequently, Noether symmetry, a point-like symmetry of the Lagrangian is used and it is found that the Lie algebra of the Noether symmetry is a subalgebra of the corresponding Lie algebra of the Lie symmetry.

21258,2,"Hypermassive Black Hole Shines in the Childhood Universe Based on the general polytropic hydrodynamic formalism of elf-similar gravitational collapse with spherical symmetry, we study the self-similar dynamic formation of black holes (BHs) in several astrophysical and cosmological contexts such as stellar mass BHs (sMBHs), intermediate mass BHs (IMBHs), supermassive BHs (SMBHs) and hypermassive BHs (HMBHs) – the latter two in the early Universe are of special interest here. We invoke the Paczynski-Wiita gravity to capture the key effects of general relativity and show the growth of BHs including SMBHs and HMBHs can be very rapid and effective in sufficiently massive host halos within timescales shorter than the Universe age of ∼ 13:8 billion years. The effective pressure in our hydrodynamic formalism can represent that of gas in stars, that of random stellar motions in globular clusters, in bulges of spiral galaxies, and in elliptical galaxies, that of random galaxy motions in clusters of galaxies and that of random motions of dark matter (DM) particles as well as that of combinations of various pertinent components (including turbulence). In particular, we have predicted in 2013 that HMBHs in the mass range of ∼10$^{10}$ −10$^{12}M_\odot$ or larger can exist in the Universe and even in the early Universe in the forms of hard X-ray/gamma-ray sources or quasars [1]. We discuss several observational evidence for pertinent aspects and classifications and further speculate the possibility of DM BHs (DMBHs) and mixed matter BHs (MMBHs) in reference to the Bonnor-Ebert critical equilibrium condition with two tentative observed candidates. Based on the three-dimensional perturbation analysis of a spherical dynamic collapse [2, 3], certain internal gravity modes (g-modes) and all vorticity modes (v-modes) are unstable, implying inevitable turbulent massive motions during a dynamic collapse of forming a BH. Physical consequences including gravitational wave emissions, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo processes, and acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) associated with such massive turbulence during dynamic collapses are also discussed. For the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) further strengthened with infrared spectrometers, it is certainly capable of identifying quasars and ultra and extremely luminous infrared galaxies harboring SMBHs and/or HMBHs in the Universe including the early Universe.

A perturbative analysis of cavity and waveguide excitation based on the Bethe theorem and normal mode expansion is developed to compensate the beam loading effect and excite the maximum field gradient in the cavity.

21406,2,"Quantum Monte Carlo study of electrostatic potential in graphene In this paper the interaction potential between static charges in suspended graphene is studied within the quantum Monte Carlo approach.

The dielectric permittivity at zero temperature is found to have the following properties. At zero distance ε=2.24±0.02. Then it rises and at a large distance the dielectric permittivity reaches the plateau ε≃4.20±0.66. The results obtained in this paper allow us to draw a conclusion that full account of many-body effects in the dielectric permittivity of suspended graphene gives ε very close to the one-loop results. Contrary to the one-loop result, the two-loop prediction for the dielectric permittivity deviates from our result. So one can expect large higher order corrections to the two-loop prediction for the dielectric permittivity of suspended graphene.",1

Using existence results for asymptotic solutions to this problem, we develop the details of how to proliferate conformal hypersurface invariants. In addition we show how to compute the the solution's asymptotics. We also develop a calculus of conformal hypersurface invariant differential operators and in particular, describe how to compute extrinsically coupled analogues of conformal Laplacian powers.

21423,2,"Cold dark energy constraints from the abundance of galaxy clusters We constrain cold dark energy of negligible sound speed using galaxy cluster abundance observations. In contrast to standard quasi-homogeneous dark energy, negligible sound speed implies clustering of the dark energy fluid at all scales, allowing us to measure the effects of dark energy perturbations at cluster scales. We compare those models and set the stage for using non-linear information from semi-analytical modelling in cluster growth data analyses. For this, we recalibrate the halo mass function with non-linear characteristic quantities, the spherical collapse threshold and virial overdensity, that account for model and redshift-dependent behaviours, as well as an additional mass contribution for cold dark energy. We present the first constraints from this cold dark matter plus cold dark energy mass function using our cluster abundance likelihood, which self-consistently accounts for selection effects, covariances and systematic uncertainties. We combine cluster growth data with cosmic microwave background, supernovae Ia and baryon acoustic oscillation data, and find a shift between cold versus quasi-homogeneous dark energy of up to 1σ. We make a Fisher matrix forecast of constraints attainable with cluster growth data from the ongoing Dark Energy Survey (DES). For DES, we predict ∼ 50 per cent tighter constraints on (Ω_m, w) for cold dark energy versus wCDM models, with the same free parameters. Overall, we show that cluster abundance analyses are sensitive to cold dark energy, an alternative, viable model that should be routinely investigated alongside the standard dark energy scenario.",1
21500,2,"Distinguishing Kerr naked singularities and black holes using the spin precession of a test gyro in strong gravitational fields We study here the precession of the spin of a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer in the Kerr spacetime, specifically, to distinguish a naked singularity (NS) from a black hole (BH). It was shown recently that for gyros attached to static observers, their precession frequency became arbitrarily large in the limit of approach to the ergosurface. For gyros attached to stationary observers that move with nonzero angular velocity Ω, this divergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such gyros, the precession frequencies diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and regular for a NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine detection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that for a near-extremal NS (1<a*<1.1), characteristic features appear in the radial profiles of the precession frequency, using which we can further distinguish a near-extremal NS from a BH, or even from a NS with larger angular momentum. We then investigate the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession or nodal plane precession frequency of the accretion disk around a BH and NS to show that clear distinctions exist for these configurations in terms of radial variation features. The LT precession in equatorial circular orbits increases on approaching a BH, whereas for NS it increases, attains a peak, and then decreases. Interestingly, for a*=1.089, it decreases until it vanishes at a certain radius, and it acquires negative values for a*>1.089 for a certain range of r. For 1<a*<1.089, a peak appears, but the LT frequency remains positive definite. There are important differences in accretion disk LT frequencies for a BH and a NS and since LT frequencies are intimately related to observed quasiperiodic oscillations, these features might allow us to determine whether a given rotating compact astrophysical object is a BH or a NS.",1

21765,2,"Internal Delensing of Cosmic Microwave Background Acoustic Peaks We present a method to delens the acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra internally, using lensing maps reconstructed from the CMB itself. We find that when delensing CMB acoustic peaks with a lensing potential map derived from the same CMB sky, a large bias arises in the delensed power spectrum. The cause of this bias is that the noise in the reconstructed potential map is derived from, and hence correlated with, the CMB map when delensing. This bias is more significant relative to the signal than an analogous bias found when delensing CMB B modes. We calculate the leading term of this bias, which is present even in the absence of lensing. We also demonstrate one method to remove this bias, using reconstructions from CMB angular scales within given ranges to delens CMB scales outside of those ranges. Some details relevant for a realistic analysis are also discussed, such as the importance of removing mask-induced effects for successful delensing, and a useful null test, obtained from randomizing the phases of the reconstructed potential. Our findings should help current and next-generation CMB experiments obtain tighter parameter constraints via the internal removal of lensing-induced smoothing from temperature and E-mode acoustic peaks.",1
21786,2,"Statistical simulations of the dust foreground to cosmic microwave background polarization The characterization of the dust polarization foreground to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a necessary step toward the detection of the B-mode signal associated with primordial gravitational waves. We present a method to simulate maps of polarized dust emission on the sphere that is similar to the approach used for CMB anisotropies. This method builds on the understanding of Galactic polarization stemming from the analysis of Planck data. It relates the dust polarization sky to the structure of the Galactic magnetic field and its coupling with interstellar matter and turbulence. The Galactic magnetic field is modeled as a superposition of a mean uniform field and a Gaussian random (turbulent) component with a power-law power spectrum of exponent αM. The integration along the line of sight carried out to compute Stokes maps is approximated by a sum over a small number of emitting layers with different realizations of the random component of the magnetic field. The model parameters are constrained to fit the power spectra of dust polarization EE, BB, and TE measured using Planck data. We find that the slopes of the E and B power spectra of dust polarization are matched for αM = −2.5, an exponent close to that measured for total dust intensity but larger than the Kolmogorov exponent − 11/3. The model allows us to compute multiple realizations of the Stokes Q and U maps for different realizations of the random component of the magnetic field, and to quantify the variance of dust polarization spectra for any given sky area outside of the Galactic plane. The simulations reproduce the scaling relation between the dust polarization power and the mean total dust intensity including the observed dispersion around the mean relation. We also propose a method to carry out multifrequency simulations, including the decorrelation measured recently by Planck, using a given covariance matrix of the polarization maps. These simulations are well suited to optimize component separation methods and to quantify the confidence with which the dust and CMB B-modes can be separated in present and future experiments. We also provide an astrophysical perspective on our phenomenological modeling of the dust polarization spectra.Key words: polarization / ISM: general / cosmic background radiation / submillimeter: ISM",1

The acceleration gradient is 26 GV/m for a 1.3 TW CO$_{2}$ laser system.

22110,2,"Characterisation of highly radiation-damaged SiPMs using current measurements The characterisation of radiation-damaged SiPMs is a major challenge, when the average time between dark counts approaches, or even exceeds, the signal decay time. In this note a collection of formulae is presented, which have been developed and used for the analysis of current measurements for SiPMs in the dark and illuminated by an LED, before and after hadron irradiation. It is shown, how parameters like the breakdown voltage, the quenching resistance, the dark-count rate, the reduction of the photo-detection efficiency due to dark counts and the Geiger discharge probability can be estimated from current-voltage measurements. The only additional SiPM parameters needed are the pixel capacitance, the number of pixels and the correlated noise. Central to the method is the concept of the pixel occupancy, the probability of a Geiger discharge in a single pixel during a given time interval, for which the decay time of the SiPM signal has been assumed. As an illustration the formulae are used to characterise a KETEK SiPM before and after irradiation by a fluence of 5E13 cm$^{-2}$ of reactor neutrons for temperatures of -30{\deg}C and +20{\deg}C, where dark-count rates exceeding 1E11 Hz are observed.",1

22178,2,"In-flight energy calibration of the space-borne Compton polarimeter POLAR POLAR is a compact wide-field space-borne detector for precise measurements of the linear polarisation of hard X-rays emitted by transient sources in the energy range from 50 keV to 500 keV. It consists of a 40$\times$40 array of plastic scintillator bars used as a detection material. The bars are grouped in 25 detector modules. The energy range sensitivity of POLAR is optimized to match with the prompt emission photons from the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Polarization measurements of the prompt emission would probe source geometries, emission mechanisms and magnetic structures in GRB jets. The instrument can also detect hard X-rays from solar flares and be used for precise measurement of their polarisation. POLAR was launched into a low Earth orbit on-board the Chinese space-lab TG-2 on September 15th, 2016. To achieve high accuracies in polarisation measurements it is essential to assure both before and during the flight a precise energy calibration. Such calibrations are performed with four low activity $^{22}$Na radioactive sources placed inside the instrument. Energy conversion factors are related to Compton edge positions from the collinear annihilation photons from the sources. This paper presents main principles of the in-flight calibration, describes studies of the method based on Monte Carlo simulations and its laboratory verification and finally provides some observation results based on the in-flight data analysis.",1

The second results are the discrete version of Bianchi identity and Gauss-Codazzi equation, together with their geometrical interpretations. It turns out that the discrete Bianchi identity and Gauss-Codazzi equation, at least in 3-dimension, could be derived from the dihedral angle formula of a tetrahedron, while the dihedral angle relation itself is the spherical law of cosine in disguise. Furthermore, the continuous infinitesimal curvature 2-form, the standard Bianchi identity, and Gauss-Codazzi equation could be recovered in the continuum limit.",1

22329,2,"New generalizations of cosmography inspired by the Padé approximant The current accelerated expansion of the universe has been one of the most important fields in physics and astronomy since 1998. Many cosmological models have been proposed in the literature to explain this mysterious phenomenon. Since the nature and cause of the cosmic acceleration are still unknown, model-independent approaches to study the evolution of the universe are welcome. One of the powerful model-independent approaches is the so-called cosmography. It only relies on the cosmological principle, without postulating any underlying theoretical model. However, there are several shortcomings in the usual cosmography. For instance, it is plagued with the problem of divergence (or an unacceptably large error), and it fails to predict the future evolution of the universe. In the present work, we try to overcome or at least alleviate these problems, and we propose two new generalizations of cosmography inspired by the Padé approximant. One is to directly parameterize the luminosity distance based on the Padé approximant, while the other is to generalize cosmography with respect to a so-called $y_\beta $ -shift $y_\beta =z/(1+\beta z)$ , which is also inspired by the Padé approximant. Then we confront them with the observational data with the help of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code emcee, and find that they work fairly well.",1
22335,2,"On the number of light rings in curved spacetimes of ultra-compact objects In a very interesting paper, Cunha, Berti, and Herdeiro have recently claimed that ultra-compact objects, self-gravitating horizonless solutions of the Einstein field equations which have a light ring, must possess at least two (and, in general, an even number of) light rings, of which the inner one is stable . In the present compact paper we explicitly prove that, while this intriguing theorem is generally true, there is an important exception in the presence of degenerate light rings which, in the spherically symmetric static case, are characterized by the simple dimensionless relation 8πrγ2(ρ+pT)=1 [here rγ is the radius of the light ring and {ρ,pT} are respectively the energy density and tangential pressure of the matter fields]. Ultra-compact objects which belong to this unique family can have an odd number of light rings. As a concrete example, we show that spherically symmetric constant density stars with dimensionless compactness M/R=1/3 possess only one light ring which, interestingly, is shown to be unstable .",1
22424,2,"The recoiling black hole candidate 3C 186: spatially-resolved quasar feedback and further evidence of a blue-shifted broad line region We present the results of integral field spectroscopy of the gravitational wave (GW) recoiling black hole candidate 3C 186. The goal of the observations is to study the kinematics of the [OIII]5007 narrow emission line region (NLR) of the quasar, and investigate the origin of the velocity offsets originally measured for different UV lines. The results show that i) the spatial structure of the NLR is complex. The [OIII]5007 line shows significant velocity offsets with respect to the systemic redshift of the source. Different components at different velocities (-670, -100, + 75 km s^-1) are produced in different regions of the source. ii) we detect both the narrow and the broad components of the Hbeta line. The narrow component generally follows the kinematics of the [OIII] line, while the broad component is significantly blue-shifted. The peak of the broad line is near the blue end, or possibly outside of the sensitivity band of the instrument, implying a velocity offset of >~1800 km s^-1. This result is in agreement with the interpretation of the QSO as a GW recoiling black hole. The properties of the NLR show that the observed outflows are most likely the effect of radiation pressure on the (photoionized) gas in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy.",1
22487,2,"Nuclear binding near a quantum phase transition How do protons and neutrons bind to form nuclei? This is the central question of ab initio nuclear structure theory. While the answer may seem as simple as the fact that nuclear forces are attractive, the full story is more complex and interesting. In this work we present numerical evidence from ab initio lattice simulations showing that nature is near a quantum phase transition, a zero-temperature transition driven by quantum fluctuations. Using lattice effective field theory, we perform Monte Carlo simulations for systems with up to twenty nucleons. For even and equal numbers of protons and neutrons, we discover a first-order transition at zero temperature from a Bose-condensed gas of alpha particles (He4 nuclei) to a nuclear liquid. Whether one has an alpha-particle gas or nuclear liquid is determined by the strength of the alpha-alpha interactions, and we show that the alpha-alpha interactions depend on the strength and locality of the nucleon-nucleon interactions. This insight should be useful in improving calculations of nuclear structure and important astrophysical reactions involving alpha capture on nuclei. Our findings also provide a tool to probe the structure of alpha cluster states such as the Hoyle state responsible for the production of carbon in red giant stars and point to a connection between nuclear states and the universal physics of bosons at large scattering length.",1

22609,2,"Robert Dicke and the naissance of experimental gravity physics, 1957–1967 The experimental study of gravity became much more active in the late 1950s, a change pronounced enough be termed the birth, or naissance, of experimental gravity physics. I present a review of developments in this subject since 1915, through the broad range of new approaches that commenced in the late 1950s, and up to the transition of experimental gravity physics to what might be termed a normal and accepted part of physical science in the late 1960s. This review shows the importance of advances in technology, here as in all branches of natural science. The role of contingency is illustrated by Robert Dicke’s decision in the mid-1950s to change directions in mid-career, to lead a research group dedicated to the experimental study of gravity. The review also shows the power of nonempirical evidence. Some in the 1950s felt that general relativity theory is so logically sound as to be scarcely worth the testing. But Dicke and others argued that a poorly tested theory is only that, and that other nonempirical arguments, based on Mach’s Principle and Dirac’s Large Numbers hypothesis, suggested it would be worth looking for a better theory of gravity. I conclude by offering lessons from this history, some peculiar to the study of gravity physics during the naissance, some of more general relevance. The central lesson, which is familiar but not always well advertised, is that physical theories can be empirically established, sometimes with surprising results.",1

Using a simulated Galactic population of DWDs, we show that donor and accretor masses can be inferred for up to ∼60 systems observed by both Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Gaia. Half of these systems will have mass constraints and .

22627,2,"First performance evaluation of a Multi-layer Thick Gaseous Electron Multiplier with in-built electrode meshes - MM-THGEM We describe a new micro-pattern gas detector structure comprising a multi-layer hole-type multiplier (M-THGEM) combined with two in-built electrode meshes: the Multi-Mesh THGEM-type multiplier (MM-THGEM). Suitable potential differences applied between the various electrodes provide an efficient collection of ionization electrons within the MM-THGEM holes and a large charge avalanche multiplication between the meshes. Different from conventional hole-type multipliers (e.g. Gas Electron Multipliers - GEMs, Thick Gas Electron Multipliers - THGEMs, etc.), which are characterized by a variable (dipole-like) field strength inside the avalanche gap, electrons in MM-THGEMs are largely multiplied by a strong uniform field established between the two meshes, like in the parallel-plate avalanche geometry. The presence of the two meshes within the holes allows for the trapping of a large fraction of the positive ions that stream back to the drift region. A gas gain above 10^5 has been achieved for single photo-electron detection with a single MM-THGEM in Ar/(10%)CH4 and He/(10%)CO2, at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. When the MM-THGEM is coupled to a conventional THGEM and used as first cascade element, the maximum achievable gains reach values above 10^6 in He/(10%)CO2, while the IBF approaches of 1.5% in the case of optimum detector-bias configuration. This IBF value is several times lower compared to the one obtained by a double GEM/THGEM detector (5-10%), and equivalent to the performance attained by a Micromegas detector.",1
22662,2,"FPGA Based Pico-second Time Measurement System for a DIRC-like TOF Detector A prototype of DIRC-like Time-of-Flight detector (DTOF), including a pico-second time measurement electronics, is developed and tested preliminarily.

The full electronics chain consists of a programmable differential amplifier, a dual-threshold differential discriminator, and a timestamp Time-to-Digital convertor. By splitting a MCP-PMT output signal into two identical electronics chains, the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of pure electronics was measured as 5.6 ps. By the beam test in H4 (150GeV/c, Muon) at CERN, the intrinsic CTR of the whole detector prototype reaches 15.0 ps without using time-amplitude correction. The test results demonstrate that the FPGA based front-end electronics could achieve an excellent time performance for TOF detectors.

22711,2,"Higgs collider phenomenology: important backgrounds, naturalness probes and the electroweak phase transition. The Higgs boson discovered in 2012, might be the portal to new physics. With the Higgs as
the common theme we present the following research arcs.
In order to study the Higgs, it is important to have a very good handle on Standard model(SM)
backgrounds. One such background process is SM WW production, which reported routine 3
sigma excesses in early run 1 of the LHC. However, experiments use Parton Showers for theoretical
prediction and this might be inadequate for exclusive cross-sections. We show that taking into
account higher order Sudakov logarithms through transverse momentum and jet-veto resummation
predicts a larger cross-section than parton showers and reduces the theory-experiment disagreement. Next, improvements are suggested to the state-of-the-art finite temperature field theory calculations
that can predict the nature of the electroweak phase transitions in beyond-the-standard
model scenarios. We find that relaxing the high-temperature approximation and resumming logs of
temperature to super-daisy order can have significant changes in the order of the phase transition.
This in turn can have important consequences for the possibility of creating the baryon anti-baryon
asymmetry across this phase transition. Our improved calculation in general predicts weaker phase
transitions, and hence smaller baryon-anti baryon asymmetry. This strengthens the case for building
future colliders in the form of a no-lose theorem; absence of deviation from the Standard model
in Higgs precision physics can falsify the possibility of Electroweak Baryogenesis.
Finally, we present another consequence of Higgs precision studies, constraining new physics
invented to ameliorate the hierarchy problem. These theories generically predict top partners at the
electroweak scale, which are connected with the top quark through a symmetry. However these top
partners have not been detected at colliders making the electroweak scale severely fine-tuned. We
find that generically, top-partner mass limits will reach a TeV just from Higgs precision at future
colliders.",1

such as non-perturbative QCD and diffraction, left undone. Tevatron results also
remain relevant for the √ s-dependence of electroweak and strong processes, and
publications continue at a reduced rate (41, 26, and 20 in 2014, 2015, and 2016
respectively, about equally from CDF and D-Zero). In the final month of
operation, special short low-luminosity runs at √ s = 300 GeV and 900 GeV were
taken to supplement the standard √ s = 1960 GeV running. In this talk I report
on some new CDF results using the full data set of about 9.5 fb −1 at √ s = 1960

to |η| = 7.4 (later reduced to |η| = 5.9). 2 Inclusive high-p T photon
production Prompt, or direct, photons at high p T , namely those not from
resonance decays (mostly π 0 and η 0), are mainly from QCD-Compton scattering (g
+q → γ +q) or q ¯ q annihilation (q + ¯ q → g +γ). In addition, direct photons
can be radiated off an initial or final state quark line (fragmentation), but in
this analysis 2 these are suppressed by requiring the photon candidate to be
isolated, i.e. with little energy deposition near the EM shower. The measurement
provides relatively high precision (compared to jets) tests of perturbative QCD,
and information on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation
functions (FFs). These events can also be a background to important processes
such as H → γ + γ (H = Higgs boson), and play an important role in searches for
physics beyond the Standard Model. Photon candidates have an EM shower profile
consistent with a single photon, with |η| < 1.0 and E T (γ) > 30 GeV, and no

22843,2,"Autopilot regulation for the Linac4 H$^−$ ion source Linac4 is a 160 MeV H$^−$ linear accelerator part of the upgrade of the LHC injector chain. Its cesiated surface H$^−$ source is designed to provide a beam intensity of 40-50mA. It is operated with periodical Cs-injection at typically 30 days intervals [1] and this implies that the beam parameters will slowly evolve during operation. Autopilot is a control software package extending CERN developed Inspector framework. The aim of Autopilot is to automatize the mandatory optimization and cesiation processes and to derive performance indicators, thus keeping human intervention minimal. Autopilot has been developed by capitalizing on the experience from manually operating the source. It comprises various algorithms running in real-time, which have been devised to: • Optimize the ion source performance by regulation of H2 injection, RF power and frequency. • Describe the performance of the source with performance indicators, which can be easily understood by operators. • Identify failures, try to recover the nominal operation and send warning in case of deviation from nominal operation. • Make the performance indicators remotely available through Web pages. Autopilot is at the same level of hierarchy as an operator, in the CERN infrastructure. This allows the combination of all ion source devices, providing the required flexibility. Autopilot is executed in a dedicated server, ensuring unique and centralized control, yet allowing multiple operators to interact at runtime, always coordinating between them. Autopilot aims at flexibility, adaptability, portability and scalability, and can be extended to other components of CERN’s accelerators. In this paper, a detailed description of the Autopilot algorithms is presented, along with first results of operating the Linac4 H$^−$ Ion Source with Autopilot.",1

23116,2,"Gravity and decoherence: the double slit experiment revisited The double slit experiment is iconic and widely used in classrooms to demonstrate the fundamental mystery of quantum physics. The puzzling feature is that the probability of an electron arriving at the detector when both slits are open is not the sum of the probabilities when the slits are open separately. The superposition principle of quantum mechanics tells us to add amplitudes rather than probabilities and this results in interference. This experiment defies our classical intuition that the probabilities of exclusive events add. In understanding the emergence of the classical world from the quantum one, there have been suggestions by Feynman, Diosi and Penrose that gravity is responsible for suppressing interference. This idea has been pursued in many different forms ever since, predominantly within Newtonian approaches to gravity. In this paper, we propose and theoretically analyse two ‘gedanken’ or thought experiments which lend strong support to the idea that gravity is responsible for decoherence. The first makes the point that thermal radiation can suppress interference. The second shows that in an accelerating frame, Unruh radiation does the same. Invoking the Einstein equivalence principle to relate acceleration to gravity, we support the view that gravity is responsible for decoherence.",1

23279,2,"Inference of Unresolved Point Sources At High Galactic Latitudes Using Probabilistic Catalogs The detection of point sources in images is a fundamental operation in astrophysics, and is crucial for constraining population models of the underlying point sources or characterizing the background emission. Standard techniques fall short in the crowded-field limit, losing sensitivity to faint sources and failing to track their covariance with close neighbors. We construct a Bayesian framework to perform inference of faint or overlapping point sources. The method involves probabilistic cataloging, where samples are taken from the posterior probability distribution of catalogs consistent with an observed photon count map. In order to validate our method, we sample random catalogs of the gamma-ray sky in the direction of the North Galactic Pole (NGP) by binning the data in energy and point-spread function classes. Using three energy bins spanning 0.3–1, 1–3, and 3–10 GeV, we identify ${270}_{-10}^{+30}$ point sources inside a $40^\circ \times 40^\circ $ region around the NGP above our point-source inclusion limit of $3\times {10}^{-11}$ cm(−)(2) s(−)(1) sr(−)(1) GeV(−)(1) at the 1–3 GeV energy bin. Modeling the flux distribution as a power law, we infer the slope to be $-{1.92}_{-0.05}^{+0.07}$ and estimate the contribution of point sources to the total emission as ${18}_{-2}^{+2}$%. These uncertainties in the flux distribution are fully marginalized over the number as well as the spatial and spectral properties of the unresolved point sources. This marginalization allows a robust test of whether the apparently isotropic emission in an image is due to unresolved point sources or of truly diffuse origin.",1
23335,2,"A squeezed review on coherent states and nonclassicality for non-Hermitian systems with minimal length It was at the dawn of the historical developments of quantum mechanics when Schrödinger, Kennard and Darwin proposed an interesting type of Gaussian wave packets, which do not spread out while evolving in time. Originally, these wave packets are the prototypes of the renowned discovery, which are familiar as “coherent states” today. Coherent states are inevitable in the study of almost all areas of modern science, and the rate of progress of the subject is astonishing nowadays. Nonclassical states constitute one of the distinguished branches of coherent states having applications in various subjects including quantum information processing, quantum optics, quantum superselection principles and mathematical physics. On the other hand, the compelling advancements of non-Hermitian systems and related areas have been appealing, which became popular with the seminal paper by Bender and Boettcher in 1998. The subject of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems possessing real eigenvalues are exploding day by day and combining with almost all other subjects rapidly, in particular, in the areas of quantum optics, lasers and condensed matter systems, where one finds ample successful experiments for the proposed theory. For this reason, the study of coherent states for non-Hermitian systems have been very important. In this article, we review the recent developments of coherent and nonclassical states for such systems and discuss their applications and usefulness in different contexts of physics. In addition, since the systems considered here originated from the broader context of the study of minimal uncertainty relations, our review is also of interest to the mathematical physics community.",1

In this scenario, supermassive black holes form when their progenitors - supermassive stars - become unstable to gravitational collapse. For uniformly rotating stars supported by pure radiation pressure and spinning at the mass-shedding limit, the critical configuration at the onset of collapse is characterized by universal values of the dimensionless spin and radius parameters $J/M^2$ and $R/M$, independent of mass $M$. We consider perturbative effects of gas pressure, magnetic fields, dark matter and dark energy on these parameters, and thereby determine the domain of validity of this universality. We obtain leading-order corrections for the critical parameters and establish their scaling with the relevant physical parameters.

Our predictions are model independent in the sense that we do not rely on a specific parametrization, but we instead use a principal component (PC) basis function constructed a priori from a noise model of supernovae and Cosmic Microwave Background observations. For the supernovae measurements, we consider two type of surveys: the current JLA and the upcoming WFIRST surveys. We show that WFIRST will be able to improve growth predictions in curved models significantly. The remaining degeneracy between spatial curvature and $w(z)$ could be overcome with improved measurements of $\sigma_8 \Omega_m^{1/2}$, a combination that controls the amplitude of the growth of structure. We also point out that a PC-based Figure of Merit reveals that the usual two-parameter description of $w(z)$ does not exhaust the information that can be extracted from current data (JLA) or future data (WFIRST).",1
23591,2,"Dielectric Loaded High Pressure Gas Filled RF Cavities for Use in Muon Cooling Channels High brightness muon beams require significant six dimensional cooling. One cooling scheme, the Helical Cooling Channel, employs high pressure gas filled radio frequency cavities, which provide both the absorber needed for ionization cooling, and a means to mitigate RF breakdown. The cavities are placed along the beam's trajectory, and contained within the bores of superconducting solenoid magnets. Gas filled RF cavities have been shown to successfully operate within multi-Tesla external magnetic fields, and not be overcome with the loading resulting from beam-induced plasma. The remaining engineering hurdle is to find a way to fit 325 and 650 MHz single cell pillbox cavities within the bores of the magnets using modern technology. One method to accomplish this is to partially fill the cavities with a dielectric material. Alumina (Al2O3) is an ideal dielectric, and the experimental test program to determine its performance under high power in a gas filled cavity has concluded. The final results, and their implications for the design of a muon cooling channel based on gas filled RF cavities will be discussed.",1
23690,2,"Optimal scan strategies for future CMB satellite experiments The B-mode polarization power spectrum in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is about four orders of magnitude fainter than the CMB temperature power spectrum. Any instrumental imperfections that couple temperature fluctuations to B-mode polarization must therefore be carefully controlled and/or removed. We investigate the role that a scan strategy can have in mitigating certain common systematics by averaging systematic errors down with many crossing angles. We present approximate analytic forms for the error on the recovered B-mode power spectrum that would result from differential gain, differential pointing and differential ellipticity for the case where two detector pairs are used in a polarization experiment. We use these analytic predictions to search the parameter space of common satellite scan strategies in order to identify those features of a scan strategy that have most impact in mitigating systematic effects. As an example, we go on to identify a scan strategy suitable for the CMB satellite proposed for the European Space Agency M5 call, considering the practical considerations of fuel requirement, data rate and the relative orientation of the telescope to the earth. Having chosen a scan strategy we then go on to investigate the suitability of the scan strategy.",1

23932,2,"Application of probabilistic modelling for the uncertainty evaluation of alignment measurements of large accelerator magnets assemblies Micrometric assembly and alignment requirements for future particle accelerators, and especially large assemblies, create the need for accurate uncertainty budgeting of alignment measurements. Measurements and uncertainties have to be accurately stated and traceable, to international standards, for metre long sized assemblies, in the range of tens of μm. Indeed, these hundreds of assemblies will be produced and measured by several suppliers around the world, and will need to be integrated into a single machine. As part of the PACMAN project at CERN, we proposed and studied a practical application of probabilistic modelling of task-specific alignment uncertainty by applying Simulation By Constraints (SBC) calibration method. Using this method, we calibrated our measurement model using available data from ISO standardised tests (10360 series) for the metrology equipment. We combined this model with reference measurements and analysis of the measured data to quantify the actual specific uncertainty of each alignment measurement procedure. Our methodology was successfully validated against a calibrated and traceable 3D artefact as part of an international inter-laboratory study. The validated models were used to study the expected alignment uncertainty and important sensitivity factors of measuring the shortest and longest of the Compact Linear Collider study assemblies, 0.54 m and 2.1 m respectively. In both cases, the laboratory alignment uncertainty was within the targeted uncertainty budget 12 μm (68% confidence level). It was found that the remaining uncertainty budget for any additional alignment error compensations, such as the thermal drift error caused due to variation in machine operation heat load conditions, need to be within 8.9 $\mu$m and 9.8 $\mu$m (68% confidence level) respectively.",1
24012,2,Generalized Grassmann variables for quantum kit (k-level) systems and Barut–Girardello coherent states for su(r + 1) algebras This paper concerns the construction of $su(r+1)$ Barut--Girardello coherent states in term of generalized Grassmann variables. We first introduce a generalized Weyl-Heisenberg algebra ${\cal A}(r)$ ($r \geq 1$) generated by $r$ pairs of creation and annihilation operators. This algebra provides a useful framework to describe qubit and qukit ($k$-level) systems. It includes the usual Weyl-Heisenberg and $su(2)$ algebras. We investigate the corresponding Fock representation space. The generalized Grassmann variables are introduced as variables spanning the Fock--Bargmann space associated with the algebra ${\cal A}(r)$. The Barut--Girardello coherent states for $su(r+1)$ algebras are explicitly derived and their over--completion properties are discussed.,1
24073,2,"Quenches near Ising quantum criticality as a challenge for artificial neural networks The near-critical unitary dynamics of quantum Ising spin chains in transversal and longitudinal magnetic fields is studied using an artificial neural network representation of the wave function. A focus is set on strong spatial correlations which build up in the system following a quench into the vicinity of the quantum critical point. We compare correlations observed following reinforcement learning of the network states with analytical solutions in integrable cases and tDMRG simulations, as well as with predictions from a semi-classical discrete Truncated Wigner analysis. While the semi-classical approach excells mainly at short times and for small transverse fields, the neural-network representation provides accurate results for a much wider range of parameters.

During O1 and O2 $\textit{Swift}$ successfully tiled hundreds of square-degrees of sky in the LVC localization regions, searching for, and identifying, possible X-ray and UV/O transients in the field. $\textit{Swift}$ made important contributions to the discovery and characterization of the kilonova AT 2017gfo, discovering the UV emission and providing the deepest X-ray upper limits in the first 24 hours after the trigger, strongly constraining the dynamics and geometry of the counterpart. $\textit{Swift}$ tiled 92% of the galaxy convolved error region down to average X-ray flux sensitivities of $10^{-12}$ erg $\mbox{cm}^{-2}$ $\mbox{s}^{-1}$, significantly increasing our confidence that AT 2017gfo is indeed the counterpart to GW 170817 and sGRB 170817. However, there remains significant room for improvement of $\textit{Swift}$'s follow-up in preparation for O3. This will take the form of both revised observation strategy based on detailed analysis of the results from O2, and significant changes to $\textit{Swift}$'s operational capabilities. These improvements are necessary both for maximizing the likelihood that $\textit{Swift}$ finds a counterpart, and minimizing the impact that follow-up activities have on other $\textit{Swift}$ science priorities. We outline areas of improvement to the observing strategy itself for optimal tiling of the LVC localization regions.

24161,2,"Lensing bias to CMB polarization measurements of compensated isocurvature perturbations Compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) are opposite spatial fluctuations in the baryon and dark matter (DM) densities. They arise in the curvaton model and some models of baryogenesis. While the gravitational effects of baryon fluctuations are compensated by those of DM, leaving no observable impacts on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at first order, they modulate the sound horizon at recombination, thereby correlating CMB anisotropies at different multipoles. As a result, CIPs can be reconstructed using quadratic estimators similarly to CMB detection of gravitational lensing. Because of these similarities, however, the CIP estimators are biased with lensing contributions that must be subtracted. These lensing contributions for CMB polarization measurement of CIPs are found to roughly triple the noise power of the total CIP estimator on large scales. In addition, the cross power with temperature and E-mode polarization are contaminated by lensing-ISW (integrated Sachs-Wolfe) correlations and reionization-lensing correlations respectively. For a cosmic-variance-limited temperature and polarization experiment measuring out to multipoles lmax=2500, the lensing noise raises the detection threshold by a factor of 1.5, leaving a 2.7σ detection possible for the maximal CIP signal in the curvaton model.",1

24247,2,"Five-dimensional Perspective on Higgs Physics and the b → sγ Transition in a Warped Extra Dimension This thesis studies the Higgs-boson production and decay processes as well as the flavorchanging
neutral current b → sγ in models with one warped extra dimension, where the
gauge bosons and fermions propagate into the bulk and the Higgs sector is localized on
or near the infra-red brane. These so-called Randall-Sundrum models present attractive
scenarios beyond the Standard Model of particle physics that can address the disparity
between the electroweak and the Planck scale. Furthermore, these models provide a
natural explanation for the hierarchical pattern observed in the flavor sector and the
smallness of flavor-changing neutral currents.
In order to search for hints of a warped extra dimension this work mainly focuses on
loop-induced processes, which can receive significant contributions from the exchange
of heavy Kaluza-Klein resonances in the loops. Working in the five-dimensional (5D)
framework, the Feynman amplitudes of the Higgs-production process via gluon fusion
gg → h, the Higgs decay into two photons h → γγ and the electromagnetic dipole
transition b → sγ are expressed in terms of integrals over fermion and gauge-boson
5D propagators. Using 5D propagators avoids the notion of infinite sums over KaluzaKlein
states and allows to obtain analytically closed expressions valid to all orders in
an expansion of v2/M2 KK. The fermion 5D propagator is derived by retaining the full
dependence of the Yukawa matrices and by regularizing the profile of the Higgs vacuum
expectation value by a square box of width η and height 1/η with η ≪ v|Yq|/MKK.
It is shown that the amplitude of the fermion triangle diagram that contributes to
gg → h and h → γγ depends on the localization of the Higgs sector on or near the infrared
brane. This leads to a classification of different Randall-Sundrum models according to
the parametric relation of the characteristic width of the Higgs-boson profile with respect
to the two ratios v|Yq|/MKK and v|Yq|/ΛTeV, where ΛTeV is the ultra-violet cutoff near
the infra-red brane. In the phenomenological part of this thesis corrections to the treelevel
cW , cZ, ct, cb, cτ and loop-induced effective ceff g, ceff γ Higgs couplings are compared
with fit results of experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider. Furthermore,
modifications of the signal rates of the processes pp → h → b¯b,τ +τ−,WW∗,ZZ∗ ,γγ are
analyzed, which can exclude large fractions of the Randall-Sundrum parameter space.
Finally, the loop-induced electro- and chromomagnetic dipole coefficients C7γ,8g and
their chirality-flipped counterparts C˜ 7γ,8g are investigated at one-loop order. The main
corrections from virtual Kaluza-Klein modes arise from the scalar part of the W-boson
penguin diagrams, which includes the contributions from the fifth component of the 5D
gauge boson and from the charged Nambu-Goldstone bosons in the Higgs sector. For the
phenomenological analysis the dipole coefficients are renormalization-group evolved to
the B-meson scale while taking into account the mixing effects between the electro- and
chromomagnetic dipole operators. The branching ratio for the inclusive decay B¯ → Xsγ
and the time-dependent CP asymmetry in B¯0 d → K¯ ∗0γ are studied, showing that sizeable
corrections can only occur for large values of the entries of the anarchic 5D Yukawa
matrices.",1
24267,2,"TELEPARALLEL GRAVITY WITH NON-VANISHING CURVATURE Guided by the rules of Einstein’s geometrization philosophy, a pure geometric field theory is constructed. The Lagrangian used to derive the field equations of the theory is a curvature scalar of a version of absolute parallelism (AP-)geometry known in the literature as the parameterized absolute parallelism (PAP-)geometry. The linear connection of this version has simultaneously non-vanishing curvature and torsion. Analysis of the theory obtained shows clearly that it is a pure gravity theory. The theory is a teleparallel one, since the building blocks of both PAP and AP geometries are the same. It is shown analytically that the theory has a trivial version in the AP-geometry, if gravity is attributed to curvature not to torsion. In the case of spherical symmetry, solutions of the field equations give rise to the Schwarzchild exterior field. The theory depends on two principles: covariance and unification. The weak equivalence principle (WEP) is satisfied under a certain condition. The work preserves Einstein’s main idea that gravity is just space-time curvature, although it is not a metric theory. It is shown that the theory reduces to vacuum general relativity upon taking the parameter of the geometry b = 0.",1

24632,2,"The no-signaling principle, and quantum brachistochrone problem in $PT$-symmetric fermionic two- and four-dimensional models Fermionic systems differ from bosonic ones in several ways, in particular that the time-reversal operator $T$ is odd, $T^2=-1$. For $PT$-symmetric bosonic systems, the no-signaling principle and the quantum brachistochrone problem have been studied to some degree, both of them controversially. In this paper, we apply the basic methods proposed for bosonic systems to {\it fermionic} two- and four-dimensional $PT$-symmetric Hamiltonians, and obtain several surprising results: We find - in contrast to the bosonic case - that the no-signaling principle is upheld for two-dimensional fermionic Hamiltonians, however, the $PT$ symmetry is broken. In addition, we find that the time required for the evolution from a given initial state, the spin-up, to a given final state, the spin-down, is a constant, independent of the parameters of the Hamiltonian, under the eigenvalue constraint. That is, it cannot - as in the bosonic case - be optimized. We do, however, also find a dimensional dependence: four-dimensional $PT$-symmetric fermionic Hamiltonians considered here again uphold the no-signaling principle, but it is not essential that the $PT$ symmetry be broken. The symmetry is, however, broken if the measure of entanglement is conserved. In the four-dimensional systems, the evolution time between orthogonal states is dependent on the parameters of the Hamiltonian, with the conclusion that it again can be optimized, and approach zero under certain circumstances. However, if we require the conservation of entanglement, the transformation time between these two states becomes the same constant as found in the two-dimensional case, which coincides with the minimum time for such a transformation to take place in the Hermitian case.",1

However, the greater availability and accuracy of beam diagnostics and the ever better correction of linear magnetic lattice imperfections (beta beating at 1% level and coupling at 0.1%) are reaching what seems to be the intrinsic accuracy and precision of different measurement techniques. This paper aims to highlight and quantify, when possible, the limitations of one standard method, the harmonic analysis of turn-by-turn beam position data. To this end, new analytic formulas for the evaluation of lattice parameters modified by focusing errors are derived.

24942,2,"Introduction to Machine Protection Protection of accelerator equipment is as old as accelerator technology and was for many years related to high-power equipment. Examples are the protection of powering equipment from overheating (magnets, power converters, high-current cables), of superconducting magnets from damage after a quench and of klystrons. The protection of equipment from beam accidents is more recent, although there was one paper that discussed beam-induced damage for the SLAC linac (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) as early as in 1967. It is related to the increasing beam power of high-power proton accelerators, to the emission of synchrotron light by electron-positron accelerators and to the increase of energy stored in the beam. Designing a machine protection system requires an excellent understanding of accelerator physics and operation to anticipate possible failures that could lead to damage. Machine protection includes beam and equipment monitoring, a system to safely stop beam operation (e.g. dumping the beam or stopping the beam at low energy) and an interlock system providing the glue between these systems. The most recent accelerator, LHC, will operate with about 3 x 10$^{14}$ protons per beam, corresponding to an energy stored in each beam of 360 MJ. This energy can cause massive damage to accelerator equipment in case of uncontrolled beam loss, and a single accident damaging vital parts of the accelerator could interrupt operation for years. This lecture will provide an overview of the requirements for protection of accelerator equipment and introduces various protection systems. Examples are mainly from LHC and ESS.",1

If this is the case, self-consistency should forbid certain initial conditions from ever happening, a possibility at odds with the local nature of dynamical laws. Here we consider the most general deterministic dynamics connecting classical degrees of freedom defined on a set of bounded space-time regions, requiring that it is compatible with arbitrary operations performed in the local regions. We find that any such dynamics can be realised through reversible interactions. We further find that consistency with local operations is compatible with non-trivial time travel: Three parties can interact in such a way to be all both in the future and in the past of each other, while being free to perform arbitrary local operations. We briefly discuss the quantum extension of the formalism.",1

25623,2,"Dynamical response of Bose-Einstein condensates to oscillating gravitational fields A description of the dynamical response of uniformly trapped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) to oscillating external gravitational fields is developed, with the inclusion of damping. Two different effects that can lead to the creation of phonons in the BEC are identified; direct driving and parametric driving. Additionally, the oscillating gravitational field couples phonon modes, which can lead to the transition of excitations between modes. The special case of the gravitational field of a small, oscillating sphere located closely to the BEC is considered. It is shown that measurement of the effects may be possible for oscillating source masses down to the milligram scale, with a signal to noise ratio of the order of 10. To this end, noise terms and variations of experimental parameters are discussed and generic experimental parameters are given for specific atom species. The results of this article suggest the utility of BECs as sensors for the gravitational field of very small oscillating objects which may help to pave the way towards gravity experiments with masses in the quantum regime.",1
25645,2,"Zero-temperature limit and Statistical Quasiparticles in Many-Body Perturbation Theory The zero-temperature limit in perturbative statistical mechanics for many-fermion systems is investigated. It is shown that this leads to the consideration of a different reference Hamiltonian, or more precisely, a different self-consistent mean-field, at each order in many-body perturbation theory. The corresponding perturbation series satisfies at each order and for all temperatures the thermodynamical relations associated with Landau Fermi-liquid theory. The associated reference single-particle energy spectra however are in general inconsistent with the dynamical aspects of Fermi-liquid theory. Nevertheless, it may be argued that this particular perturbation series is, in a sense, the proper one for numerical calculations of thermodynamic potentials.",1

The ensuing numerical results strengthen the interpretation of such decay widths and constants as a way to quantify the coupling between a resonance and the continuum. We calculate explicitly the decay energy spectrum of the resonances of the delta-shell potential, and we show numerically that the lineshape of such spectrum is not the same as, and can be very different from, the Breit–Wigner (Lorentzian) distribution.

After follow-up interferometric observations to identify extended or variable sources, a list of 16 compact, steep-spectrum candidates is generated. An ongoing search for pulsations in these candidates, in gamma rays and radio, has found six millisecond pulsars and one normal pulsar. A comparison of this method with existing selection criteria based on gamma-ray spectral and variability properties suggests that the pulsar discovery space using Fermi may be larger than previously thought. Radio imaging is a hitherto underutilized source selection method that can be used, as with other multi-wavelength techniques, in the search for Fermi pulsars.",1

25825,2,"Cosmic rays: bringing messages from the sky to the Earth's surface All the evolution of the scientific knowledge about Cosmic Rays (CRs) in the 20 t h century leads to the following statement: Cosmic Rays constitutes a time and spatial variable flux of fully ionized energetic atoms and sub-atomic particles with specific abundances and energies that continuously permeates the solar system, reaching the Earth and producing ionization and nuclear reactions in our atmosphere. Since the primary CR flux is composed of charged particles, it is expected that any magnetic irregularity and/or turbulence affects their large scale transport and consequently its energy spectrum. Moreover, since the interaction of the CR particles with the terrestrial atmosphere produces not only atmospheric ionization, but also nuclear reactions (creating a cascade of secondary particles), it is easy to understand that near ground CR measurements (direct or indirect) may allow us to study the physical processes involved in the journey of CR particles (including the birth conditions of the lower energetic ones and the propagation of the higher energetic ones through the heliosphere) before reaching the terrestrial environment, and also along the transport of the secondary particles into the Earth's atmosphere. In this sense, considering a cosmic ray particle as a ”celestial messenger” is reasonable. Therefore, several works have been using the CR footprints found in the terrestrial surface (through the ground-based measurement of cosmogenic tracers) as a tool for solar and atmospheric studies. It is present here a discussion concerning the time evolution of the CR scientific knowledge and a brief review of the physical concepts of those celestial messengers.",1
25844,2,"Design Considerations for Proposed Fermilab Integrable RCS Integrable optics is an innovation in particle accelerator design that provides strong nonlinear focusing while avoiding parametric resonances. One promising application of integrable optics is to overcome the traditional limits on accelerator intensity imposed by betatron tune-spread and collective instabilities. The efficacy of high-intensity integrable accelerators will be undergo comprehensive testing over the next several years at the Fermilab Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) and the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). We propose an integrable RCS (iRCS) as a replacement for the Fermilab Booster to achieve multi-MW beam power for the Fermilab high-energy neutrino program. We provide a overview of the machine parameters and discuss an approach to lattice optimization.

25859,2,"Modeling rf resonant cavity method for measuring electron cloud effect using plasma dielectrics Electron cloud effect (ECE) is one of the main obstacles to achieving better performance and beam stability in current and future accelerators. For instance, ECE has been observed at the LHC at all bunch spacings, and the 2015 upgrade to 25 ns spacings is expected to require additional time for scrubbing in order to gain acceptable beam parameters. rf diagnostics of ECE are a non-destructive technique for measuringplasma density and the efficacy of mitigation in high-performance accelerators. Traveling wave rf diagnostic experiments have detected electron clouds by measuring side-bands from the modulation of phase shifts induced by electron cloud plasmas. However, it is difficult to measure the absolute plasma density using traveling wave techniques, and the effects of reflections and attenuation is not known, which increases the measurement error.An alternative method is the resonant cavity rf diagnostic. In these experiments, rf power is inserted into the beam pipe at a frequency just below the cutoff frequency, and the signal is measured in the same location as the transmitter. Since the rf is below the cutoff frequency, the wave does not propagate, but rather exponentially decays, effectively creating a resonant cavity at the location of the rf source. The resonant frequency of this virtual cavity changes due to the presence of an electron cloud that is modulated as the cloud builds up and dissipates. This frequency modulation is observed as side bands at intervals of the revolution frequency.We have previously developed numerical models of traveling wave rf diagnostics of ECE using an integrated PIC/plasma dielectricmodel. We apply that model here to the resonant cavity method, and simulate side bands due to frequency modulation when the rf is injected below the cutoff frequency for different magnetic fields. The rf modulation can be completely described using the dielectric properties of the electron cloud plasma. However, it is necessary to perform PIC simulations in order to accurately model electron cloud buildup and dissipation due to beam crossings. Simulations are run for many revolution periods to resolve side band structures, and so must be numerically stable over long simulation times.",1

The block-spin parameter must be tuned differently for different exponents to produce optimal convergence.,1
25984,2,"Statistical measurement of the gamma-ray source-count distribution as a function of energy Photon counts statistics have recently been proven to provide a sensitive observable for characterizing gamma-ray source populations and for measuring the composition of the gamma-ray sky.

We analyze gamma-ray data in five adjacent energy bands between 1 and 171 GeV. We measure the source-count distribution dN/dS as a function of energy, and demonstrate that our results extend current measurements from source catalogs to the regime of so far undetected sources. Our method improves the sensitivity for resolving point-source populations by about one order of magnitude in flux. The dN/dS distribution as a function of flux is found to be compatible with a broken power law. We derive upper limits on further possible breaks as well as the angular power of unresolved sources.

We discuss explicitly partial successes but also potential pitfalls of these simplest models. Although primarily seen as toy models, the relevant free parameters are fixed by best-fit values using the Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA)-sample data. On the basis of a likelihood analysis we find that a local hump with an extension of almost 2 Gpc provides a better description of the observations than a local void for which we obtain a best-fit scale of about 30 Mpc.

The latter satisfy equations of motion of the glM Ruijsenaars–Schneider model. In the elliptic case it holds M=N while for the rational and trigonometric models M is not necessarily equal to N . Our consideration is similar to the previously obtained results for the Calogero–Moser models which are recovered in the non-relativistic limit. We also show that the self-dual description of the Ruijsenaars–Schneider models can be derived from complexified intermediate long wave equation with discrete Laplacian by means of the simple pole ansatz likewise the Calogero–Moser models arise from ordinary intermediate long wave and Benjamin–Ono equations.,1

26320,2,"Inspiral waveforms for spinning compact binaries in a new precessing convention It is customary to use a precessing convention, based on Newtonian orbital angular momentum L (N), to model inspiral gravitational waves from generic spinning compact binaries. A key feature of such a precessing convention is its ability to remove all spin precession induced modulations from the orbital phase evolution. However, this convention usually employs a postNewtonian (PN) accurate precessional equation, appropriate for the PN accurate orbital angular momentum L, to evolve the L (N)-based precessing source frame. This motivated us to develop inspiral waveforms for spinning compact binaries in a precessing convention that explicitly use L to describe the binary orbits. Our approach introduces certain additional 3PN order terms in the orbital phase and frequency evolution equations with respect to the usual L (N)-based implementation of the precessing convention. The implications of these additional terms are explored by computing the match between inspiral waveforms that employ L and L (N)-based precessing conventions. We found that the match estimates are smaller than the optimal value, namely 0.97, for a non-negligible fraction of unequal mass spinning compact binaries.",1
26334,2,"Ultra Compact Stars: Reconstructing the Perturbation Potential In this work we demonstrate how different semi-classical methods can be combined in a novel way to reconstruct the perturbation potential of ultra compact stars. Besides rather general assumptions, the only specific information entering this approach is the spectrum of the trapped axial quasi-normal modes. In general it is not possible to find a unique solution for the potential in the inverse problem, but instead a family of potentials producing the same spectrum. Nevertheless, this already determines important properties of the involved potential and can be used to rule out many candidate models. A unique solution was found based on the additional natural assumption that the exterior part ($r \gtrsim 3\, M$ ) is described by the Regge–Wheeler potential. This is true in general relativity for any non-rotating spherically symmetric object. This technique can be potentially applied for the study of deviations from general relativity. The methods we demonstrate are easy to implement and rather general, therefore we expect them also to be interesting for other fields where inverse spectrum problems are studied, e.g. quantum physics and molecular spectroscopy.",1

The presented isolation performance is measured under vacuum conditions using a combination of commercial and custom-made inertial sensors. Detailed analysis of this performance led to the design and implementation of tuned dampers to mitigate the effect of the unavoidable higher order modes of the system.

Fitting the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model to the Sachs-Wolfe effect, $\sigma_8$, the galaxy power spectrum $P_\textrm{gal}(k)$, fluctuations of galaxy counts in spheres of radii ranging from $16/h$ to $128/h$ Mpc, BAO measurements, and $h = 0.678 \pm 0.009$, in various combinations, with free spectral index $n$, and free galaxy bias and galaxy bias slope, we obtain consistent measurements of $\sum m_\nu$.

26441,2,"Shadows of spherically symmetric black holes and naked singularities We compare shadows cast by Schwarzschild black holes with those produced by two classes of naked singularities that result from gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric matter. The latter models consist of an interior naked singularity spacetime restricted to radii $r\leq R_b$, matched to Schwarzschild spacetime outside the boundary radius $R_b$. While a black hole always has a photon sphere and always casts a shadow, we find that the naked singularity models have photon spheres only if a certain parameter $M_0$ that characterizes these models satisfies $M_0\geq 2/3$, or equivalently, if $R_b\leq 3M$, where $M$ is the total mass of the object. Such models do produce shadows. However, models with $M_0<2/3$ (or $R_b>3M$) have no photon sphere and do not produce a shadow. Instead, they produce an interesting ""full-moon"" image. These results imply that the presence of a shadow does not by itself prove that a compact object is necessarily a black hole. The object could be a naked singularity with $M_0\geq 2/3$, and we will need other observational clues to distinguish the two possibilities. On the other hand, the presence of a full-moon image would certainly rule out a black hole and might suggest a naked singularity with $M_0<2/3$. It would be worthwhile to generalize the present study, which is restricted to spherically symmetric models, to rotating black holes and naked singularities.",1
26455,2,"Relations between Transition Rates and Quantum Numbers in Gravitational Potentials This paper forms part of an ongoing investigation to examine the quantum prediction that isolated baryons and electrons in the deep gravity wells of galaxy halos should exhibit reduced interaction cross-sections by virtue of the composition of the gravitational eigenspectra of their wave functions, and thereby identify a possible mechanism responsible for the origin of dark matter, without resorting to new physics or unknown particles. Relevant to this investigation are the electromagnetic state-to-state transition rates of charged particles occupying these gravitational eigenstates (EinsteinA coefficients), and, in the present work, we examine trends in these rates and net state lifetimes for particles in 1/r potential wells for values of the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum quantum number l. We find that transition rates decrease with increasing n and l, and that the rate is more steeply dependent on l when the quantum parameter Δp (≡ Δn − Δl) is greater, in agreement with earlier work. It is also found that there is an empirical relationship between the total state lifetime τ and the eigenvalues n and l, which is given by τ ∝ n$^{α}$ l$^{β}$ , where α ≈ 3 and β ≈ 2. The results apply equally to electrical potential wells, where the phenomena of reduced cross-sections and long radiative lifetimes is well known in the case of the Rydberg states of electrons in atoms. More importantly, in the case of gravitational eigenstates discussed here, the quantum prediction of low Einstein A (and therefore B) coefficients ofmany of the stateto-state transitions will mean that a particle whose eigenspectral composition consists of many of these weakly interacting states will be less likely to undergo scattering processes such as Compton scattering. Trends in the Einstein coefficients over the range of component eigenstates are required for calculating the net visibility and interaction rates of the generalized wave functions representing charged particles in macroscopic gravitational fields.",1
26461,2,"Scalar Hint from the Diboson Excess? The possibility of testing the presence of new resonances in the Large Hadron

26563,2,"Interactions, Symmetry, Lorentz Invariance: The Struggle of Physicists About These Concepts As well known, a still large number of physicists understands the whole corpus of theoretical physics as a complex system which, after all, is based on three primeval and fundamental pillars, constituted by the concepts of Interaction, Symmetry, and (excluding Cosmology) Lorentz Invariance. In the last century some new ideas, like the ones arising from quantum theory or disordered systems, seemed to introduce deep changes into this sound conceptual picture. In this contribution, I will try to evidence that this state of affairs is actually changing, on the basis of new suggestions introduced by researchers such as Jean-Pierre Vigier, who put forward strong arguments supporting the need for a radical change of the conceptual structure of physics. These arguments came mainly from the applications of physics to highly complex systems. This situation gave rise to a sort of struggle between the holders of different conceptions and it is becoming clearer that the old concepts of interaction, symmetry, and Lorentz invariance will survive only when applied to enough simple systems. Among the many evidences of the aforementioned change I will limit myself to discuss two cases: 1) the introduction, within classical field theories, of new theoretical proposals which generalize in a somewhat ‘heretical’ way the traditional constructs of interactions and symmetry used in mathematical physics; 2) the need for using, within mathematical models of complex system behaviours (like, for instance biological neural networks), methods for assessing the validity of the introduced models based not only on general mathematical arguments, but also on computer simulations of model dynamics.",1

26596,2,"Self-gravitating fluid systems and galactic dark matter We study gravitational collapse with anisotropic pressures, whose end stage can mimic space–times that are seeded by galactic dark matter. To this end, we identify a class of space–times (with conical defects) that can arise out of such a collapse process, and admit stable circular orbits at all radial distances. These have a naked singularity at the origin. An example of such a space–time is seen to be the Bertrand space–time discovered by Perlick, that admits closed, stable orbits at all radii. Using relativistic two-fluid models, we show that our galactic space–times might indicate exotic matter, i.e one of the component fluids may have negative pressure for a certain asymptotic fall off of the associated mass density, in the Newtonian limit. We complement this analysis by studying some simple examples of Newtonian two-fluid systems, and compare this with the Newtonian limit of the relativistic systems considered.",1
26610,2,"Complete Reionization Constraints from Planck 2015 Polarization We conduct an analysis of the Planck 2015 data that is complete in reionization observables from the large angle polarization E-mode spectrum in the redshift range 6<z<30. Based on 5 principal components, all of which are constrained by the data, this single analysis can be used to infer constraints on any model for reionization in the same range; we develop an effective likelihood approach for applying these constraints to models. By allowing for an arbitrary ionization history, this technique tests the robustness of inferences on the total optical depth from the usual steplike transition assumption, which is important for the interpretation of many other cosmological parameters such as the dark energy and neutrino mass. The Planck 2015 data not only allow a high redshift z>15 component to the optical depth but prefer it at the 2σ level. This preference is associated with excess power in the multipole range 10≲ℓ≲20 and may indicate high redshift ionization sources or unaccounted for systematics and foregrounds in the 2015 data.",1
26694,2,"A Class of Integrable Metrics II Starting with a subclass of the four-dimensional spaces possessing two commuting Killing vectors and a non-trivial Killing tensor, we fully integrate Einstein's vacuum equation with a cosmological constant. Although most of the solutions happen to be already known, we have found a solution that, as far as we could search for, has not been attained before. We also characterize the geometric properties of this new solution, it is a Kundt spacetime of Petrov type II possessing a null Killing vector field and an isometry algebra that is three-dimensional and abelian. In particular, such solution becomes a pp-wave spacetime when the cosmological constant is set to zero.",1
26873,2,"Eigenvalue hypothesis for multi-strand braids Computing polynomial form of the colored HOMFLY-PT for non-arborescent knots obtained from three or more strand braids is still an open problem. One of the efficient methods suggested for the three-strand braids relies on the eigenvalue hypothesis which uses the Yang-Baxter equation to express the answer through the eigenvalues of the ${\cal R}$-matrix. In this paper, we generalize the hypothesis to higher number of strands in the braid where commuting relations of non-neighbouring $\mathcal{R}$ matrices are also incorporated. By solving these equations, we determine the explicit form for $\mathcal{R}$-matrices and the inclusive Racah matrices in terms of braiding eigenvalues (for matrices of size up to 6 by 6). For comparison, we briefly discuss the highest weight method for four-strand braids carrying fundamental and symmetric rank two $SU_q(N)$ representation. Specifically, we present all the inclusive Racah matrices for representation $[2]$ and compare with the matrices obtained from eigenvalue hypothesis.",1
26935,2,"Influence of topological constraints and topological excitations: Decomposition formulas for calculating homotopy groups of symmetry-broken phases A symmetry broken phase of a system with internal degrees of freedom often features a complex order parameter, which generates a rich variety of topological excitations and imposes topological constraints on their interaction (topological influence); yet the very complexity of the order parameter makes it difficult to treat topological excitations and topological influence systematically. To overcome this problem, we develop a general method to calculate homotopy groups and derive decomposition formulas which express homotopy groups of the order parameter manifold G/H in terms of those of the symmetry G of a system and those of the remaining symmetry H of the state. By applying these formulas to general monopoles and three-dimensional skyrmions, we show that their textures are obtained through substitution of the corresponding su(2) subalgebra for the su(2) spin. We also show that a discrete symmetry of H is necessary for the presence of topological influence and find topological influence on a skyrmion characterized by a non-Abelian permutation group of three elements in the ground state of an SU(3)-Heisenberg model.",1
26996,2,"EMUS-QMC: Elective Momentum Ultra-Size Quantum Monte Carlo Method One bottleneck of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of strongly correlated electron systems lies at the scaling relation of computational complexity with respect to the system sizes. For generic lattice model of interacting fermions, the best methodology at hand still scales with $\beta N^3$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $N$ is the system size. Such scaling behavior has greatly hampered the accessibility of the universal infrared (IR) physics of many interesting correlated electron models at (2+1)D, let alone (3+1)D. To reduce the computational complexity, we develop a new QMC method with inhomogeneous momentum-space mesh, dubbed elective momentum ultra-size quantum Monte Carlo (EQMC) method. Instead of treating all fermionic excitations on an equal footing as in conventional QMC methods, by converting the fermion determinant into the momentum space, our method focuses on fermion modes that are directly associated with low-energy (IR) physics in the vicinity of the so-called hot-spots, while other fermion modes irrelevant for universal properties are ignored. As shown in the manuscript, for any cutoff-independent quantities, e.g. scaling exponents, this method can achieve the same level of accuracy with orders of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. We demonstrate this method with a model of antiferromagnetic itinerant quantum critical point, realized via coupling itinerant fermions with a frustrated transverse-field Ising model on a triangle lattice. The system size of $48 \times 48 \times 48$ ($L\times L\times\beta$, more than 4 times larger than previous investigations) are comfortably accessed with EQMC. With much larger system sizes, the scaling exponents are unveiled with unprecedentedly high accuracy, and this result sheds new light on the open debate about the nature and the universality class of itinerant quantum critical points.",1
27002,2,The Measurement of a Temperature Dependence of the Count Rate of Single Electrons Emitted From Copper by Means of a Multicathode Counter It was found that at cryogenic temperatures the spontaneous emission of single electrons from cathode of PMT is increased by lowering the temperature of PMT. This effect has not found yet a satisfactory explanation. It was suggested by us that the source of cryogenic dark current is a conversion of hidden photons on a metallic surface. To check this hypothesis a series of measurements have been performed using a multicathode counter developed by us as a detector of single electrons. Upon the results of measurements during 78 days in configurations R1 and R2 of a multicathode counter with a copper cathode the dependence of the counting rate of single electrons on temperature has been obtained. The results obtained are in agreement with the hypotheses that hidden photons are the source of a cryogenic dark current. These very preliminary results have to be checked by further measurements.,1
27045,2,"Double power series method for approximating cosmological perturbations We introduce a double power series method for finding approximate analytical solutions for systems of differential equations commonly found in cosmological perturbation theory. The method was set out, in a noncosmological context, by Feshchenko, Shkil’ and Nikolenko (FSN) in 1966, and is applicable to cases where perturbations are on subhorizon scales. The FSN method is essentially an extension of the well known Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) method for finding approximate analytical solutions for ordinary differential equations. The FSN method we use is applicable well beyond perturbation theory to solve systems of ordinary differential equations, linear in the derivatives, that also depend on a small parameter, which here we take to be related to the inverse wave–number. We use the FSN method to find new approximate oscillating solutions in linear order cosmological perturbation theory for a flat radiation–matter universe. Together with this model’s well-known growing and decaying Mészáros solutions, these oscillating modes provide a complete set of subhorizon approximations for the metric potential, radiation and matter perturbations. Comparison with numerical solutions of the perturbation equations shows that our approximations can be made accurate to within a typical error of 1%, or better. We also set out a heuristic method for error estimation. A Mathematica notebook which implements the double power series method is made available online.",1

27130,2,"Geographically distributed Batch System as a Service: the INDIGO-DataCloud approach exploiting HTCondor One of the challenges a scientific computing center has to face is to keep delivering well consolidated computational frameworks (i.e. the batch computing farm), while conforming to modern computing paradigms. The aim is to ease system administration at all levels (from hardware to applications) and to provide a smooth end-user experience. Within the INDIGO- DataCloud project, we adopt two different approaches to implement a PaaS-level, on-demand Batch Farm Service based on HTCondor and Mesos. In the first approach, described in this paper, the various HTCondor daemons are packaged inside pre-configured Docker images and deployed as Long Running Services through Marathon, profiting from its health checks and failover capabilities. In the second approach, we are going to implement an ad-hoc HTCondor framework for Mesos. Container-to-container communication and isolation have been addressed exploring a solution based on overlay networks (based on the Calico Project). Finally, we have studied the possibility to deploy an HTCondor cluster that spans over different sites, exploiting the Condor Connection Broker component, that allows communication across a private network boundary or firewall as in case of multi-site deployments. In this paper, we are going to describe and motivate our implementation choices and to show the results of the first tests performed.",1
27136,2,"Probing the Gravitational Dependence of the Fine-Structure Constant from Observations of White Dwarf Stars Hot white dwarf stars are the ideal probe for a relationship between the fine-structure constant and strong gravitational fields, providing us with an opportunity for a direct observational test. We study a sample of hot white dwarf stars, combining far-UV spectroscopic observations, atomic physics, atmospheric modelling, and fundamental physics in the search for variation in the fine structure constant. This variation manifests as shifts in the observed wavelengths of absorption lines, such as quadruply ionized iron (FeV) and quadruply ionized nickel (NiV), when compared to laboratory wavelengths. Berengut et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2013, 111, 010801) demonstrated the validity of such an analysis using high-resolution Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra of G191-B2B. We have made three important improvements by: (a) using three new independent sets of laboratory wavelengths; (b) analysing a sample of objects; and (c) improving the methodology by incorporating robust techniques from previous studies towards quasars (the Many Multiplet method). A successful detection would be the first direct measurement of a gravitational field effect on a bare constant of nature. Here we describe our approach and present preliminary results from nine objects using both FeV and NiV.",1

Combining the two twist deformations we obtain noncommutative principal bundles with both noncommutative fibers and base space. More in general, the natural isomorphisms proving the equivalence of a closed monoidal category of modules and its twist related one are used to obtain new Hopf–Galois extensions as twists of Hopf–Galois extensions.

27170,2,"Effect of Dark Energy Perturbation on Cosmic Voids Formation In this paper, we present the effects of dark energy perturbation on the formation and abundance of cosmic voids. We consider dark energy to be a fluid with a negative pressure characterised by a constant equation of state w and speed of sound $c^2_s$. By solving fluid equations for two components, namely, dark matter and dark energy fluids, we quantify the effects of dark energy perturbation on the sizes of top-hat voids. We also explore the effects on the size distribution of voids based on the excursion set theory. We confirm that dark energy perturbation negligibly affects the size evolution of voids;$c^2_s = 0$ varies the size only by 0.1% as compared to the homogeneous dark energy model. We also confirm that dark energy perturbation suppresses the void size when w < -1 and enhances the void size when $w > -1$ (Basse et al. 2011). In contrast to the negligible impact on the size, we find that the size distribution function on scales larger than 10 Mpc/h highly depends on dark energy perturbation; compared to the homogeneous dark energy model, the number of large voids of radius 30Mpc is 25% larger for the model with $w = -0.9$ and $c^2_s = 0$ while they are 20% less abundant for the model with $w = -1.3$ and $c^2_s = 0$.",1

In particular, this effect is strong in the $dd\mu$ and $dt\mu$ formation. An appreciable isotopic effect in the case of nonresonant $dd\mu$ formation in $d\mu$ collisions with the molecules D$_2$ and HD has been found.

27212,2,"Simulations of a silicon pixel based on MOS Deep Trapping Gate Principle The concept of the deep trapping gate device was introduced fairly recently on the basis of technological and transport simulations currently used in the field of classical electron devices. The concept of a buried gate containing localized deep level centers for holes (Deep Trapping Gate or DTG) renders possible the operation of this field effect pixel detector. One alternative to Deep Level introduction is the use of a quantum box, which is a hole quantum-well and an electron barrier. In all of these cases the buried gate modulates the drain-source current. This principle was formerly evaluated with realistic simulations parameters and this shows that a measurable signal is obtained for an energy deposition of a minimum-ionizing particle within a limited silicon thickness. In this work a quantitative study of the response of such a pixel to Minimum Ionizing Particles. The influence of some parameters such as the thickness of the pixel and its lateral dimensions, on the operation of the pixel is studied here using current available simulation tools, in quantum mode when a narrow Ge layer is used as a buried gate. A bias sequence is introduced here to separate the operation of the pixel in detection and readout mode. The first frabrication technique introduced is deep impurity implantation, followed by annealing. Recent work on quantum boxes and dots opens the possibility to the use Ge boxes as a DTG.Ion implantation and alternative methods such an epitaxial growth DTG can be reasonably considered. If the related bottlenecks are overcome the pixel should be a good candidate for high luminosity particle collider inner detectors, provides that its potential radiation hardness is proven sufficient for these applications.",1
27230,2,"Cross-section fluctuations in chaotic scattering systems Exact analytical expressions for the cross-section correlation functions of
chaotic scattering sys- tems have hitherto been derived only under special
conditions. The objective of the present article is to provide expressions that
are applicable beyond these restrictions. The derivation is based on a
statistical model of Breit-Wigner type for chaotic scattering amplitudes which
has been shown to describe the exact analytical results for the scattering
(S)-matrix correlation functions accurately. Our results are given in the
energy and in the time representations and apply in the whole range from
isolated to overlapping resonances. The S-matrix contributions to the
cross-section correla- tions are obtained in terms of explicit irreducible and
reducible correlation functions. Consequently, the model can be used for a
detailed exploration of the key features of the cross-section correlations and
the underlying physical mechanisms. In the region of isolated resonances, the
cross-section correlations contain a dominant contribution from the
self-correlation term. For narrow states the self-correlations originate
predominantly from widely spaced states with exceptionally large partial width.
In the asymptotic region of well-overlapping resonances, the cross-section
autocorrelation functions are given in terms of the S-matrix autocorrelation
functions. For inelastic correlations, in particular, the Ericson fluctuations
rapidly dominate in that region. Agreement with known analytical and with
experimental results is excellent.",1

That is a symmetrical straight four-strip geometry. Additionally an extensive study was conducted to see effects due to manufacturing tolerances.

27535,2,"Measurements of the intrinsic quantum efficiency and absorption length of tetraphenyl butadiene thin films in the vacuum ultraviolet regime A key enabling technology for many liquid noble gas (LNG) detectors is the use of the common wavelength shifting medium tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). TPB thin films are used to shift ultraviolet scintillation light into the visible spectrum for detection and event reconstruction. Understanding the wavelength shifting efficiency and optical properties of these films are critical aspects in detector performance and modeling and hence in the ultimate physics sensitivity of such experiments. This article presents the first measurements of the room-temperature microphysical quantum efficiency for vacuum-deposited TPB thin films – a result that is independent of the optics of the TPB or substrate. Also presented are measurements of the absorption length in the vacuum ultraviolet regime, the secondary re-emission efficiency, and more precise results for the “black-box” efficiency across a broader spectrum of wavelengths than previous results. The low-wavelength sensitivity, in particular, would allow construction of LNG scintillator detectors with lighter elements (Ne, He) to target light mass WIMPs.",1

27593,2,"No evidence for dust B-mode decorrelation in Planck data Constraints on inflationary B modes using cosmic microwave background polarization data commonly rely on either template cleaning or cross-spectra between maps at different frequencies to disentangle Galactic foregrounds from the cosmological signal. Assumptions about how the foregrounds scale with frequency are therefore crucial to interpreting the data. Recent results from the Planck satellite collaboration claim significant evidence for a decorrelation in the polarization signal of the spatial pattern of Galactic dust between 217 and 353 GHz. Such a decorrelation would suppress power in the cross-spectrum between high-frequency maps, where the dust is strong, and lower-frequency maps, where the sensitivity to cosmological B modes is strongest. Alternatively, it would leave residuals in lower-frequency maps cleaned with a template derived from the higher-frequency maps. If not accounted for, both situations would result in an underestimate of the dust contribution and thus an upward bias on measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. In this paper, we revisit this measurement and find that the no-decorrelation hypothesis cannot be excluded with the Planck data. There are three main reasons for this: (i) There is significant noise bias in cross-spectra between Planck data splits that needs to be accounted for. (ii) There is strong evidence for unknown instrumental systematics, the amplitude of which we estimate using alternative Planck data splits. (iii) There are significant correlations between measurements in different sky patches that need to be taken into account when assessing the statistical significance. Between ℓ=55–90 and over 72% of the sky, the dust BB correlation between 217 and 353 GHz is 1.001-.004/.000+.004/.021 (68% stat/syst.) and shows no significant trend with the sky fraction.",1

We prove that the point symmetries are generated by the collineations of two (pseudo)metrics, which are defined in the spaces of independent and dependent variables. We demonstrate the general results in two special cases (a) a system of m coupled Laplace equations and (b) the Klein–Gordon equation of a particle in the context of Generalized Uncertainty Principle. In the second case we determine the complete invariant group of point transformations, and we apply the Lie invariants in order to find invariant solutions of the wave function for a spin-0 particle in the two dimensional hyperbolic space.",1
27702,2,"Minimization of Emittance at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring With Sloppy Models Our current method to minimize the vertical emittance of the beam at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) involves measurement and correction of the dispersion, coupling, and orbit of the beam and lets us reach emittances of 10 pm, but is limited by finite dispersion measurement resolution.* For further improvement in the vertical emittance, we propose using a method based on the theory of sloppy models.** The storage ring lattice permits us to identify the dependence of the dispersion and emittance on our corrector magnets, and taking the singular value decomposition of the dispersion/corrector Jacobian gives us the combinations of these magnets which will be effective knobs for emittance tuning, ordered by singular value. These knobs will permit us to empirically tune the emittance based on direct measurements of the vertical beam size. Simulations show that when starting from a lattice with realistic alignment errors which has been corrected by our existing method to have an emittance of a few pm, this new method will enable us to reduce the emittance to nearly the quantum limit, assuming that vertical dispersion is the primary source of our residual emittance.",1
27811,2,"A family of metric gravities The goal of this paper is to take a completely fresh approach to metric gravity, in which the metric principle is strictly adhered to but its properties in local space-time are derived from conservation principles, not inferred from a global field equation. The global field strength variation then gains some flexibility, but only in the regime of very strong fields (2nd-order terms) whose measurement is now being contemplated. So doing provides a family of similar gravities, differing only in strong fields, which could be developed into meaningful verification targets for strong fields after the manner in which far-field variations were used in the 20th century. General Relativity (GR) is shown to be a member of the family and this is demonstrated by deriving the Schwarzschild metric exactly from a suitable field strength assumption. The method of doing so is interesting in itself because it involves only one differential equation rather than the usual four. Exact static symmetric field solutions are also given for one pedagogical alternative based on potential, and one theoretical alternative based on inertia, and the prospects of experimentally differentiating these are analyzed. Whether the method overturns the conventional wisdom that GR is the only metric theory of gravity and that alternatives must introduce additional interactions and fields is somewhat semantical, depending on whether one views the field strength assumption as a field and whether the assumption that produces GR is considered unique in some way. It is of course possible to have other fields, and the local space-time principle can be applied to field gravities which usually are weak-field approximations having only time dilation, giving them the spatial factor and promoting them to full metric theories. Though usually pedagogical, some of them are interesting from a quantum gravity perspective. Cases are noted where mass measurement errors, or distributions of dark matter, can cause one theory to mimic another implying that such estimates or distributions should be first obtained from weak-field measurements before being used to discriminate verification candidates. By this method theorists gain insight into the local constraints on space-time, and GR verification gains strong-field comparative objectives.",1
27823,2,"Multi-D Simulations of Ultra-Stripped Supernovae to Shock Breakout The recent discoveries of many double neutron star systems and their detection as LIGO-Virgo merger events call for a detailed understanding of their origin. Explosions of ultra-stripped stars in binary systems have been shown to play a key role in this context and have also generated interest as a potential explanation for rapidly evolving hydrogen-free transients. Here we present the first attempt to model such explosions based on binary evolution calculations that follow the mass transfer to the companion to obtain a consistent core-envelope structure as needed for reliable predictions of the supernova transient. We simulate the explosion in 2D and 3D, and confirm the modest explosion energies ~10^50erg and small kick velocities reported earlier in 2D models based on bare carbon-oxygen cores. The spin-up of the neutron star by asymmetric accretion is small in 3D with no indication of spin-kick alignment. Simulations up to shock breakout show the mixing of sizeable amounts of iron group material into the helium envelope. In view of recent ideas for a mixing-length treatment (MLT) of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in supernovae, we perform a detailed analysis of the mixing, which reveals evidence for buoyancy-drag balance, but otherwise does not support the MLT approximation. The mixing may have implications for the spectroscopic signatures of ultra-stripped supernovae that need to be investigated in the future. Our stellar evolution calculation also predicts presupernova mass loss due to an off-centre silicon deflagration flash, which suggests that supernovae from extremely stripped cores may show signs of interactions with circumstellar material.",1
27824,2,"Nonpolynomial Lagrangian approach to regular black holes We present a review on Lagrangian models admitting spherically symmetric regular black holes (RBHs), and cosmological bounce solutions. Nonlinear electrodynamics, nonpolynomial gravity, and fluid approaches are explained in details.

The nonpolynomial gravity curvature invariants have the special property to be second-order and polynomial in the metric field, in spherically symmetric spacetimes. Along the way, other models and results are discussed, and some general properties that RBHs should satisfy are mentioned. A covariant Sakharov criterion for the absence of singularities in dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes is also proposed and checked for some examples of such regular metric fields.",1

27898,2,"ABC of ladder operators for rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator systems The problem of construction of ladder operators for rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator (REQHO) systems of a general form is investigated in the light of existence of different schemes of the Darboux–Crum–Krein–Adler transformations by which such systems can be generated from the quantum harmonic oscillator. Any REQHO system is characterized by the number of separated states in its spectrum, the number of ‘valence bands’ in which the separated states are organized, and by the total number of the missing energy levels and their position. All these peculiarities of a REQHO system are shown to be detected and reflected by a trinity $(\mathcal{A}^\pm$ , $\mathcal{B}^\pm$ , $\mathcal{C}^\pm)$ of the basic (primary) lowering and raising ladder operators related between themselves by certain algebraic identities with coefficients polynomially-dependent on the Hamiltonian. We show that all the secondary, higher-order ladder operators are obtainable by a composition of the basic ladder operators of the trinity which form the set of the spectrum-generating operators. Each trinity, in turn, can be constructed from the intertwining operators of the two complementary minimal schemes of the Darboux–Crum–Krein–Adler transformations.",1
27928,2,"Attosecond Precision Multi-km Laser-Microwave Network Synchronous laser-microwave networks delivering attosecond timing precision are highly desirable in many advanced applications, such as geodesy, very-long-baseline interferometry, high-precision navigation and multi-telescope arrays. In particular, rapidly expanding photon science facilities like X-ray free-electron lasers and intense laser beamlines require system-wide attosecond-level synchronization of dozens of optical and microwave signals up to kilometer distances. Once equipped with such precision, these facilities will initiate radically new science by shedding light on molecular and atomic processes happening on the attosecond timescale, such as intramolecular charge transfer, Auger processes and their impact on X-ray imaging. Here, we present for the first time a complete synchronous laser-microwave network with attosecond precision, which is achieved through new metrological devices and careful balancing of fiber nonlinearities and fundamental noise contributions. We demonstrate timing stabilization of a 4.7-km fiber network and remote optical-optical synchronization across a 3.5-km fiber link with an overall timing jitter of 580 and 680 attoseconds RMS, respectively, for over 40 hours. Ultimately we realize a complete laser-microwave network with 950-attosecond timing jitter for 18 hours. This work can enable next-generation attosecond photon-science facilities to revolutionize many research fields from structural biology to material science and chemistry to fundamental physics.",1

Within this region, we construct a sequence of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) with areas going to zero. These MOTS form a marginally outer trapped tube (apparent horizon). It emerges from a point and is smooth (except at that point) and spacelike. In the proof we employ a scale critical trapped surface formation criterion established by An and Luk and a new type of quasilinear elliptic equation is studied.

28031,2,"Nuclear Structure from the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group Efforts to describe nuclear structure and dynamics from first principles have advanced significantly in recent years. Exact methods for light nuclei are now able to include continuum degrees of freedom and treat structure and reactions on the same footing, and multiple approximate, computationally efficient many-body methods have been developed that can be routinely applied for medium-mass nuclei. This has made it possible to confront modern nuclear interactions from Chiral Effective Field Theory, that are rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics with a wealth of experimental data. Here, we discuss one of these efficient new many-body methods, the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG), and its applications in modern nuclear structure theory. The IMSRG evolves the nuclear many-body Hamiltonian in second-quantized form through continuous unitary transformations that can be implemented with polynomial computational effort. Through suitably chosen generators, we drive the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in configuration space to specific shapes, e.g., to implement a decoupling of low-and high-energy scales, or to extract energy eigenvalues for a given nucleus. We present selected results from Multireference IMSRG (MR-IMSRG) calculations of open-shell nuclei, as well as proof-of-principle applications for intrinsically deformed medium-mass nuclei. We discuss the successes and prospects of merging the (MR-)IMSRG with many-body methods ranging from Configuration Interaction to the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, with the goal of achieving an efficient simultaneous description of dynamic and static correlationsin atomic nuclei.",1
28054,2,"CP symmetry and thermal effects on Dirac bi-spinor spin-parity local correlations Intrinsic quantum correlations supported by the $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ structure of the Dirac equation used to describe particle/antiparticle states, optical ion traps and bilayer graphene are investigated and connected to the description of local properties of Dirac bi-spinors. For quantum states driven by Dirac-like Hamiltonians, quantum entanglement and geometric discord between spin and parity degrees of freedom - sometimes mapped into equivalent low energy internal degrees of freedom - are obtained. Such \textit{spin-parity} quantum correlations and the corresponding nonlocal intrinsic structures of bi-spinor fermionic states can be classified in order to relate quantum observables to the (non)local behavior of these correlations. It is shown that free particle mixed states do not violate the Clauser-Horne-Shymony-Holt inequality: the correlations in such mixed bi-spinors, although quantum, can be reproduced by a suitable local hidden variable model. Additionally, the effects due to a non-minimal coupling to a homogeneous magnetic field, and to the inclusion of thermal effects are evaluated, and quantum correlations of associated quantum mixtures and of the thermal states are all quantified.The above-mentioned correlation quantifiers are then used to measure the influence of CP transformations on \textit{spin-parity} quantum correlations, and our results show that quantum entanglement is invariant under CP transformations, although the geometric discord is highly sensitive to the CP symmetry.",1
28070,2,"Neutron matter, neutron pairing, and neutron drops based on chiral effective field theory interactions The physics of neutron-rich systems is of great interest in nuclear and astrophysics. Precise knowledge of the properties of neutron-rich nuclei is crucial for understanding the synthesis of heavy elements. Infinite neutron matter determines properties of neutron stars, a final stage of heavy stars after a core-collapse supernova. It also provides a unique theoretical laboratory for nuclear forces.

Strong interactions are determined by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, QCD is non-perturbative at low energies and one presently cannot directly calculate nuclear forces from it. Chiral effective field theory circumvents these problems and connects the symmetries of QCD to nuclear interactions. It naturally and systematically includes many-nucleon forces and gives access to uncertainty estimates. We use chiral interactions throughout all calculation in this thesis.

Neutron stars are very extreme objects. The densities in their interior greatly exceed those in nuclei. The exact composition and properties of neutron stars is still unclear but they consist mainly of neutrons. One can explore neutron stars theoretically with calculations of neutron matter. In the inner core of neutron stars exist very high densities and thus maybe exotic phases of matter. To investigate whether there exists a phase transition to such phases even at moderate densities we study the chiral condensate in neutron matter, the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking, and find no evidence for a phase transition at nuclear densities. We also calculate the more extreme system of spin-polarised neutron matter. With this we address the question whether there exists such a polarised phase in neutron stars and also provide a benchmark system for lattice QCD. We find spin-polarised neutron matter to be an almost non-interacting Fermi gas. To understand the cooling of neutron stars neutron pairing is of great importance. Due to the high densities especially triplet pairing is of interest. We calculate the pairing gaps in neutron matter and provide uncertainty estimates.

The formation of heavy elements in the early universe proceeds through the rapid neutron-capture process. This process requires precise knowledge of the properties of very neutron-rich nuclei, which are unstable and at present not accessible in experiments. Thus, one can explore their properties only with theoretical calculations. Currently the only approach to the properties of all nuclei are energy-density functionals (EDFs). All EDFs used today are based on phenomenological models and fits to stable nuclei, which makes their predictive power for unknown (neutron-rich) nuclei unclear. Deriving an ab initio EDF directly from the nuclear forces is an important goal of nuclear theory. A promising approach is the optimised effective potential (OEP) method. We take a step into that direction and calculate neutron drops within the OEP formalism. In addition to the exact-exchange approximation we study for the first time the effect of second-order contributions and compare to quantum Monte Carlo and other results.",1
28078,2,"A Measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background $B$-Mode Polarization Power Spectrum at Sub-Degree Scales from 2 years of POLARBEAR Data We report an improved measurement of the cosmic microwave background B-mode polarization power spectrum with the Polarbear experiment at 150 GHz. By adding new data collected during the second season of observations (2013–2014) to re-analyzed data from the first season (2012–2013), we have reduced twofold the band-power uncertainties. The band powers are reported over angular multipoles $500\leqslant {\ell }\leqslant 2100$, where the dominant B-mode signal is expected to be due to the gravitational lensing of E-modes. We reject the null hypothesis of no B-mode polarization at a confidence of 3.1σ including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We test the consistency of the measured B-modes with the Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) framework by fitting for a single lensing amplitude parameter A ( )L( ) relative to the Planck 2015 best-fit model prediction. We obtain ${A}_{L}={0.60}_{-0.24}^{+0.26}(\mathrm{stat}{)}_{-0.04}^{+0.00}(\mathrm{inst})$ ± 0.14(foreground) ± 0.04(multi), where ${A}_{L}=1$ is the fiducial ΛCDM value.",1
28115,2,"On the time delay between ultra-relativistic particles The time delay between the receptions of ultra-relativistic particles emitted simultaneously is a useful observable for both fundamental physics and cosmology. The expression of the delay when the particles travel through an arbitrary spacetime has been derived recently by Fanizza et al., using a particular coordinate system and self-consistent assumptions. The present article shows that this formula enjoys a simple physical interpretation: the relative velocity between two ultra-relativistic particles is constant. This result reveals an interesting kinematical property of general relativity, namely that the tidal forces experienced by ultra-relativistic particles in the direction of their motion are much smaller than those experienced orthogonally to their motion.",1

evaporative cooling in a crossed dipole trap. Having now in hand a much denser

Unlike earlier treatments, we include the interference between exchange diagrams. We find this exchange interference can be written as a contribution solely to the one-step process, and for small quantum nonlinearity parameter is of the same order as other one-step terms. We find the exchange interference further suppresses the one-step process in this parameter regime. Our findings further support the crucial assumption made in laser-plasma simulation codes that at high intensities, the trident process can be well-approximated by repeated iteration of the single-vertex subprocesses. The applicability of this assumption to higher-vertex processes has fundamental importance to the development of simulation capabilities.",1
28232,2,"Detailed spectral and morphological analysis of the shell type supernova remnant RCW 86 Aim. We aim for an understanding of the morphological and spectral properties of the supernova remnant RCW 86 and for insights into the production mechanism leading to the RCW 86 very high-energy γ-ray emission.Methods. We analyzed High Energy Spectroscopic System (H.E.S.S.) data that had increased sensitivity compared to the observations presented in the RCW 86 H.E.S.S. discovery publication. Studies of the morphological correlation between the 0.5–1 keV X-ray band, the 2–5 keV X-ray band, radio, and γ-ray emissions have been performed as well as broadband modeling of the spectral energy distribution with two different emission models.Results. We present the first conclusive evidence that the TeV γ-ray emission region is shell-like based on our morphological studies. The comparison with 2–5 keV X-ray data reveals a correlation with the 0.4–50 TeV γ-ray emission. The spectrum of RCW 86 is best described by a power law with an exponential cutoff at Ecut = (3.5 ± 1.2stat) TeV and a spectral index of Γ ≈ 1.6 ± 0.2. A static leptonic one-zone model adequately describes the measured spectral energy distribution of RCW 86, with the resultant total kinetic energy of the electrons above 1 GeV being equivalent to ~0.1% of the initial kinetic energy of a Type Ia supernova explosion (1051 erg). When using a hadronic model, a magnetic field of B ≈ 100 μG is needed to represent the measured data. Although this is comparable to formerly published estimates, a standard E−2 spectrum for the proton distribution cannot describe the γ-ray data. Instead, a spectral index of Γp ≈ 1.7 would be required, which implies that ∼7 × 1049/ncm−3 has been transferred into high-energy protons with the effective density ncm−3 = n/1 cm−3. This is about 10% of the kinetic energy of a typical Type Ia supernova under the assumption of a density of 1 cm−3.Key words: astroparticle physics / gamma rays: general / ISM: supernova remnants / cosmic rays",1
28265,2,"Particle-in-cell simulations of pair discharges in a starved magnetosphere of a Kerr black hole We investigate the dynamics and emission of a starved magnetospheric region (gap) formed in the vicinity of a Kerr black hole horizon, using a new, fully general relativistic particle-in-cell code that implements Monte Carlo methods to compute gamma-ray emission and pair production through the interaction of pairs and gamma rays with soft photons emitted by the accretion flow. It is found that when the Thomson length for collision with disk photons exceeds the gap width, screening of the gap occurs through low-amplitude, rapid plasma oscillations that produce self-sustained pair cascades, with quasi-stationary pair and gamma-ray spectra, and with a pair multiplicity that increases in proportion to the pair production opacity. The gamma-ray spectrum emitted from the gap peaks in the TeV band, with a total luminosity that constitutes a fraction of about $10^{-5}$ of the corresponding Blandford-Znajek power. This stage is preceded by a prompt discharge phase of duration $\sim r_g/c$, during which the potential energy initially stored in the gap is released as a flare of curvature TeV photons. We speculate that the TeV emission observed in M87 may be produced by pair discharges in a spark gap.",1
28312,2,"Intrinsic mirror noise in Fabry-Perot based polarimeters: the case for the measurement of vacuum magnetic birefringence Although experimental efforts have been active for about 30 years now, a direct laboratory observation of vacuum magnetic birefringence, an effect due to vacuum fluctuations, still needs confirmation. Indeed, the predicted birefringence of vacuum is $\Delta n = 4.0\times 10^{-24}$ @ 1~T. One of the key ingredients when designing a polarimeter capable of detecting such a small birefringence is a long optical path length within the magnetic field and a time dependent effect. To lengthen the optical path within the magnetic field a Fabry-Perot optical cavity is generally used with a finesse ranging from ${\cal F} \approx 10^4$ to ${\cal F} \approx7\times 10^5$. Interestingly, there is a difficulty in reaching the predicted shot noise limit of such polarimeters. We have measured the ellipticity and rotation noises along with a Cotton-Mouton and a Faraday effect as a function of the finesse of the cavity of the PVLAS polarimeter. The observations are consistent with the idea that the cavity mirrors generate a birefringence-dominated noise whose ellipticity is amplified by the cavity itself. The optical path difference sensitivity at $10\;$Hz is $S_{\Delta{\cal D}}=6\times 10^{-19}\;$m$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, a value which we believe is consistent with an intrinsic thermal noise in the mirror coatings.",1
28336,2,"Emergent cosmos in Einstein–Cartan theory Based on Padmanabhan’s proposal, the accelerated expansion of the universe can be driven by the difference between the surface and bulk degrees of freedom in a region of space, described by the relation $ \mathrm{d}V/\mathrm{d}t = N_\mathrm{sur}-N_\mathrm{bulk}$ where $N_\mathrm{sur}$ and $N_\mathrm{bulk}= -N_\mathrm{em} +N_\mathrm{de}$ are the degrees of freedom assigned to the surface area and the matter–energy content inside the bulk such that the indices “em” and “de” represent energy-momentum and dark energy, respectively. In the present work, the dynamical effect of the Weyssenhoff perfect fluid with intrinsic spin and its corresponding spin degrees of freedom in the framework of Einstein–Cartan (EC) theory are investigated. Based on the modification of Friedmann equations due to the spin–spin interactions, a correction term for Padmanabhan’s original relation $\mathrm{d}V /\mathrm{d} t=N_\mathrm{sur}+N_\mathrm{em} -N_\mathrm{de}$ including the number of degrees of freedom related with these spin interactions is obtained through the modification in $N_\mathrm{bulk}$ term as $N_\mathrm{bulk}= -N_\mathrm{em}+N_\mathrm{spin} +N_\mathrm{de}$ leading to $\mathrm{d}V /\mathrm{d} t=N_\mathrm{sur}+N_\mathrm{em}-N_\mathrm{spin} -N_\mathrm{de}$ in which $N_\mathrm{spin}$ is the corresponding degrees of freedom related with the intrinsic spin of the matter content of the universe. Moreover, the validity of the unified first law and the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the Einstein–Cartan cosmos are investigated. Finally, by considering the covariant entropy conjecture and the bound resulting from the emergent scenario, a total entropy bound is obtained. Using this bound, it is shown that the for the universe as an expanding thermodynamical system, the total effective Komar energy never exceeds the square of the expansion rate with a factor of $\frac{3}{4\pi }$ .",1

Data off the proton suggest that the higher-order terms contributing to the reaction include $P_{11}$, $P_{13}$, and $F_{15}$. The final results also hint that $F_{17}$ is needed to fit double-polarization observables above 1900 MeV.

The only assumption we have to make is that the potential is a non-negative smooth function. In the special case of a constant potential, a setting which is equivalent to a linear scalar field on a background with a positive cosmological constant, we achieve detailed asymptotic estimates for the different components of the spacetime metric.

28757,2,"Collective Classical and Quantum Fields This is an introductory book dealing with collective phenomena in many-body systems. A gas of bosons or fermions can show oscillations of various types of density. These are described by different combinations of field variables. Especially delicate is the competition of these variables. In superfluid 3He, for example, the atoms can be attracted to each other by molecular forces, whereas they are repelled from each other at short distance due to a hardcore repulsion. The attraction gives rise to Cooper pairs, and the repulsion is overcome by paramagnon oscillations. The combination is what finally led to the discovery of superfluidity in 3He. In general, the competition between various channels can most efficiently be studied by means of a classical version of the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. A gas of electrons is controlled by the interplay of plasma oscillations and pair formation. In a system of rod- or disc-like molecules, liquid crystals are observed with directional orientations that behave in unusual five-fold or seven-fold symmetry patterns. The existence of such a symmetry was postulated in 1975 by the author and K Maki. An aluminium material of this type was later manufactured by Dan Shechtman which won him the 2014 Nobel prize.

When$L_a/R \gg 1$, but $L_b/R \ll 1$ ( or, on the contrary,$L_a/R \ll 1$ but $L_b/R \gg 1$ ), thenthe cross section $\sigma_{{\rm coh}} (a \rightarrow b )$ is equal tothe ratio of the ""forward"" cross sections of inelastic scattering$a + N \rightarrow b + N$ and elasticscattering of the particle $b$ (or, respectively, $a$) on a nucleon,multiplied bythe cross section of scattering on the ""black"" nucleus $\pi R^2$.The cases $L_a/R \gg 1$, $L_b/R \lesssim 1$ and$L_a/R \gg 1$, $L_b/R \ll 1$ (for heavy nuclei) correspond,in particular,to the coherent production of vector mesons$\rho^0, \omega, \phi $ at the interaction of veryhigh energy photons with nuclei, and some numerical estimates aremade for the coherent process $\gamma \rightarrow \rho^0$ onthe $Pb$ nucleus.Meantime, when both the conditions $L_a/R \gg 1$ and $L_b/R\gg 1$ aresatisfied,then $\sigma_{{\rm coh}} (a \rightarrow b )$ is proportional to the factor$R^4/k^2$, where $k$ is the initial energy of the particle $a$in the laboratory frame.The formalism described above is generalized also for the case of coherentinelastic multiparticle processes on a nucleus of the type$ a \rightarrow \{ \,b_1, b_2, b_3 ....b_i \,\}$ and for the caseof coherent processes in collisions of two ultrarelativistic nuclei.",1
28791,2,"Characterization of subhalo structural properties and implications for dark matter annihilation signals A prediction of the standard Λ cold dark matter cosmology is that dark matter (DM) haloes are teeming with numerous self-bound substructure or subhaloes. The precise properties of these subhaloes represent important probes of the underlying cosmological model. We use data from Via Lactea II and Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations N-body simulations to learn about the structure of subhaloes with masses 10^6–10^11 h^−1 M_⊙. Thanks to a superb subhalo statistics, we study subhalo properties as a function of distance to host halo centre and subhalo mass, and provide a set of fits that accurately describe the subhalo structure. We also investigate the role of subhaloes on the search for DM annihilation. Previous work has shown that subhaloes are expected to boost the DM signal of their host haloes significantly. Yet, these works traditionally assumed that subhaloes exhibit similar structural properties than those of field haloes, while it is known that subhaloes are more concentrated. Building upon our N-body data analysis, we refine the substructure boost model of Sánchez-Conde & Prada (2014), and find boosts that are a factor 2–3 higher. We further refine the model to include unavoidable tidal stripping effects on the subhalo population. For field haloes, this introduces a moderate (∼20–30 per cent) suppression. Yet, for subhaloes like those hosting dwarf galaxy satellites, tidal stripping plays a critical role, the boost being at the level of a few tens of percent at most. We provide a parametrization of the boost for field haloes that can be safely applied over a wide halo mass range.",1
28800,2,"The quantum centripetal force on a free particle confined to the surface of a sphere and a cylinder The momentum operator for a spin-less particle when confined to a 2D surface embedded into 3D space acquires a geometrical component proportional to the mean curvature that renders it Hermitian. As a consequence, the quantum force operator for a particle confined to spherical and cylindrical surfaces, and free otherwise, derived by applying the Heisenberg equation of motion is found to have an apparently no-radial component in addition to the standard classical radial centripetal force. This component which renders the force operator Hermitian is shown to be essential for the vanishing of the torque the force exerts on the particle and so for the conservation of orbital angular momentum and energy. It is demonstrated that the total force is in fact radial as should be the case for a torque-less one and so can be identified as the quantum centripetal force.",1

28836,2,"Magnetotransport in a model of a disordered strange metal Despite much theoretical effort, there is no complete theory of the “strange” metal state of the high temperature superconductors, and its linear-in-temperature T resistivity. Recent experiments showing an unexpected linear-in-field B magnetoresistivity have deepened the puzzle. We propose a simple model of itinerant electrons, interacting via random couplings, with electrons localized on a lattice of “quantum dots” or “islands.” This model is solvable in a particular large-N limit and can reproduce observed behavior. The key feature of our model is that the electrons in each quantum dot are described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model describing electrons without quasiparticle excitations. For a particular choice of the interaction between the itinerant and localized electrons, this model realizes a controlled description of a diffusive marginal-Fermi liquid (MFL) without momentum conservation, which has a linear-in-T resistivity and a TlnT specific heat as T→0. By tuning the strength of this interaction relative to the bandwidth of the itinerant electrons, we can additionally obtain a finite-T crossover to a fully incoherent regime that also has a linear-in-T resistivity. We describe the magnetotransport properties of this model and show that the MFL regime has conductivities that scale as a function of B/T; however, the magnetoresistance saturates at large B. We then consider a macroscopically disordered sample with domains of such MFLs with varying densities of electrons and islands. Using an effective-medium approximation, we obtain a macroscopic electrical resistance that scales linearly in the magnetic field B applied perpendicular to the plane of the sample, at large B. The resistance also scales linearly in T at small B, and as Tf(B/T) at intermediate B. We consider implications for recent experiments reporting linear transverse magnetoresistance in the strange metal phases of the pnictides and cuprates.",1
28859,2,"Long-Term Study of the Light Curve of PKS 1510-089 in GeV energies We have analyzed data from the FSRQ PKS 1510-089 collected over a period of eight years from August 2008 to Dec 2016 with the Fermi -LAT. We have identified several flares of this highly variable source, studied their temporal and spectral properties in detail, and compared with previous works on flares of PKS 1510-089. Five major flares and a few sub-flares or sub-structures have been identified in our study. The fastest variability time is found to be 1.30 ± 0.18 hr, where we estimate the minimum size of the emission region to be 4.85 × 10 15 cm. In most of the flares, the γ -ray SEDs are better fitted with a log-parabolic distribution compared to a simple power law or a power law with exponential cutoffs. This has strong physics implications regarding the nature of the high-energy γ -ray emission region.",1
28920,2,"Observation of Plasma Bubble Structures in a GeV Laser-Plasma Accelerator We measure characteristics of plasma bubbles in GeV-class laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) using Faraday rotation diagnostics.

The signals show $\approx 0.5^\circ$ rotation streaks of opposite sign separated by $\sim50$ $\mu$m, consistent with bubble diameter; no on-axis rotation; streaks length consistent with transverse probe pulse duration ($180$ $\mu$m for $500$ fs pulse length, and $600$ $\mu$m for $2$ ps pulse length). We utilized an anamorphic imaging system to obtain a wide longitudinal field of view ($&gt;1$ cm) and a high transverse resolution ($&lt;9$ $\mu$m).

29029,2,"Cosmological parameters estimations bias from magnetically induced redshift effect Recent cosmological parameters estimations still have discrepancy in values given by different research teams. It was argued that additional contributions to our redshift measurements from non cosmological origins are responsible for this bias. But, gravitational redshift contribution couldn't account for all bias estimated. Several effects contribute to observed redshifts and a new effect is predicted to be the result of the gravitational interaction between photons and magnetic fields creating gravitational waves. The energy carried by these waves is manifested as redshifts of the photons. Contributions from this effect were not considered by previous studies and are mis-interpreted as caused from Doppler Effect or gravitational redshift. The significant impact of our effect is discussed along with possible mis-interpretations of several cosmological and astrophysical observations.",1

29176,2,"Are we living near the center of a local void? The properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarisation anisotropies measured by a static, off-centered observer located in a local spherically symmetric void, are described. In particular in this paper we compute, together with the standard 2-point angular correlation functions, the off-diagonal correlators, which are no more vanishing by symmetry. While the energy shift induced by the off-centered position of the observer can be suppressed by a proper choice of the observer velocity, a lensing-like effect on the CMB emission point remains. This latter effect is genuinely geometrical (e.g. non-degenerate with a boost) and reflects in the structure of the off-diagonal correlators. At lowest order in this effect, the temperature and polarisation correlation matrices have non-vanishing diagonal elements, as usual, and all the off-diagonal terms are excited. This particular signature of a local void model allows one, in principle, to disentangle geometrical effects from local kinematical ones in CMB observations.",1
29231,2,"Interface tension in the improved Blume-Capel model We study interfaces with periodic boundary conditions in the low-temperature phase of the improved Blume-Capel model on the simple cubic lattice. The interface free energy is defined by the difference of the free energy of a system with antiperiodic boundary conditions in one of the directions and that of a system with periodic boundary conditions in all directions. It is obtained by integration of differences of the corresponding internal energies over the inverse temperature. These differences can be computed efficiently by using a variance reduced estimator that is based on the exchange cluster algorithm. The interface tension is obtained from the interface free energy by using predictions based on effective interface models. By using our numerical results for the interface tension σ and the correlation length ξ obtained in previous work, we determine the universal amplitude ratios R2nd,+=σ0f2nd,+2=0.3863(6), R2nd,−=σ0f2nd,−2=0.1028(1), and Rexp,−=σ0fexp,−2=0.1077(3).

29285,2,"On the expected $\gamma$-ray emission from nearby flaring stars Stellar flares have been extensively studied in soft X-rays (SXRs) by basically every X-ray mission. Hard X-ray (HXR) emission from stellar superflares, however, have only been detected from a handful of objects over the past years. One very extreme event was the superflare from the young M-dwarf DG CVn binary star system, which triggered Swift/BAT as if it was a γ-ray burst. In this work, we estimate the expected γ-ray emission from DG CVn and the most extreme stellar flares by extrapolating from solar flares based on measured solar energetic particles (SEPs), as well as thermal and non-thermal emission properties. We find that ions are plausibly accelerated in stellar superflares to 100 GeV energies, and possibly up to TeV energies in the associated coronal mass ejections. The corresponding π^0-decay γ-ray emission could be detectable from stellar superflares with ground-based γ-ray telescopes. On the other hand, the detection of γ-ray emission implies particle densities high enough that ions suffer significant losses due to inelastic proton–proton scattering. The next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) should be able to probe superflares from M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood and constrain the energy in interacting cosmic rays and/or their maximum energy. The detection of γ-ray emission from stellar flares would open a new window for the study of stellar physics, the underlying physical processes in flares and their impact on habitability of planetary systems.",1

29462,2,"X-ray/GeV emissions from Crab-like pulsars in the LMC We discuss X-ray and gamma-ray emissions from Crab-like pulsars, PSRs J0537-6910 and J0540-6919, in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Fermi-LAT observations have resolved the gamma-ray emissions from these two pulsars and found pulsed emissions from PSR J0540-6919. The total pulsed radiation in the X-ray/gamma-ray energy bands of PSR J0540-6919 is observed with efficiency ${\eta }_{J0540}\sim 0.06$ (in 4π sr), which is about a factor of ten larger than ${\eta }_{\mathrm{Crab}}\sim 0.006$ of the Crab pulsar. Although PSR J0537-6910 has the highest spin-down power among currently known pulsars, the efficiency of the observed X-ray emissions is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of PSR J0540-6919. This paper mainly discusses what causes the difference in the radiation efficiencies of these three energetic Crab-like pulsars. We discuss electron/positron acceleration and high-energy emission processes within the outer gap model. By solving the outer gap structure with the dipole magnetic field, we show that the radiation efficiency decreases as the inclination angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis increases. To explain the difference in the pulse profile and in the radiation efficiency, our model suggests that PSR J0540-6919 has an inclination angle much smaller than that of the Crab pulsar (here we assume the inclination angles of both pulsars are $\alpha \lt 90^\circ $). On the other hand, we speculate that the difference in the radiation efficiencies between PSRs J0537-6910 and J0549-6919 is mainly caused by the difference in the Earth viewing angle, and that we see PSR J0537-6910 with an Earth viewing angle $\zeta \gg 90^\circ $ (or $\ll 90^\circ $) measured from the spin axis, while we see PSR J0540-6919 with $\zeta \sim 90^\circ $.",1

Two quantum wires are described by using Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquids with different TL parameters, and electron transport between the two wires is depicted by using a simple hopping interaction. We calculate the radiative corrections to the hopping interaction and obtain the renormalization (RG) exponent, making use of perturbation theory based on the boundary state formulation. The model exhibits a phase transition at zero temperature. We discuss the critical line that defines the phase boundary on the two-dimensional parameter space. The model also exhibits the particle-kink duality, which maps the strong coupling region of the model onto the weak coupling region of the dual model. The strong coupling region of the model is found to match exactly the weak coupling region of the dual model.

We describe the derivation of the implemented equations which we give in terms of the space-spinor formalism. We discuss the conformal Gauss gauge, and a slight generalization thereof which seems to be particularly useful in the presence of boundaries. We discuss the structure of the equations at the boundary and propose a method for imposing boundary conditions which allow the correct number of degrees of freedom to be freely specified while still preserving the constraints. We show that this implementation yields a numerically well-posed system by testing it on a simple case of gravitational perturbations of Minkowski space-time and subsequently with gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild space-time.",1
30086,2,"Optical conductivity of an interacting Weyl liquid in the collisionless regime Optical conductivity (OC) can serve as a measure of correlation effects in a wide range of condensed-matter systems. We show that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interaction yields a universal correction to the OC in a three-dimensional Weyl semimetal σ(Ω)=σ0(Ω)1+1N+1, where σ0(Ω)=Ne02Ω/(12hv) is the OC in the noninteracting system, with v as the actual (renormalized) Fermi velocity of Weyl quasiparticles at frequency Ω, and e0 is the electron charge in vacuum. Such universal enhancement of OC, which depends only on the number of Weyl nodes near the Fermi level (N), is a remarkable consequence of an intriguing conspiracy among the quantum-critical nature of an interacting Weyl liquid, marginal irrelevance of the long-range Coulomb interaction, and violation of hyperscaling in three dimensions, and can directly be measured in recently discovered Weyl as well as Dirac materials. By contrast, a local density-density interaction produces a nonuniversal correction to the OC, stemming from the nonrenormalizable nature of the corresponding interacting field theory.",1

30110,2,"Can the $\Lambda$CDM model reproduce MOND-like behavior? It is usually believed that MOND can describe the galactic rotational curves with only baryonic matter and without any dark matter very well, while the ΛCDM model is expected to have difficulty in reproducing MOND-like behavior.

EAGLE’s simulation result clearly reproduces the MOND-like behavior for ab⪆10-12  m/s2 at z=0, although the acceleration constant, a0, is a little larger than the observational data indicate. We find that a0 increases with the redshift in a way different from what Milgrom proposed (a0∝H). Therefore, while galaxy rotation curves can be fitted by MOND’s empirical function in the ΛCDM model, there is no clear connection between a0 and the Hubble constant. We also find that a0 at z⪆1 is well separated from a0 at z=0.

Focusing on the inner $60^{\circ} \times 60^{\circ}$ of the sky, we identify and characterize four separate residuals beyond the expected Milky Way diffuse emission. We detect the \textit{Fermi} Bubbles, finding compelling evidence that they are diffuse in nature and contain very little small-scale structure. We detect the ""cocoon"" inside the Southern Bubble, and we also identify its northern counterpart above 2 GeV. The Northern Cocoon lies along the same axis but is $\sim 30 \%$ dimmer than the southern one. We characterize the Galactic center excess, which we find extends up to $20^{\circ}$ in $|b|$. At latitudes $|b| \leq 5^{\circ}$ we find evidence for power in small angular scales that could be the result of point-source contributions, but for $|b| \geq 5^{\circ}$ the Galactic center excess is dominantly diffuse in its nature. Our findings show that either the Galactic center excess and {\it Fermi} Bubbles connect smoothly or that the Bubbles brighten significantly below $15^\circ$ in latitude. We find that the Galactic center excess appears off-center by a few degrees towards negative $\ell$.

They have fit these observed lags to a sum of two components: an assumed functional form for intrinsic time lag due to astrophysical mechanisms and an energy-dependent speed of light due to quadratic and linear Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) models. Here, we examine the statistical significance of the evidence for a transition to negative time lags. Such a transition, even if present in GRB 160625B, cannot be due to an energy dependent speed of light as this would contradict previous limits by some 3-4 orders of magnitude, and must therefore be of intrinsic astrophysical origin. We use three different model comparison techniques: a frequentist test and two information based criteria (AIC and BIC). From the frequentist model comparison test, we find that the evidence for transition in the spectral lag data is favored at 3.05 σ and 3.74 σ for the linear and quadratic models respectively. We find that ΔAIC and ΔBIC have values  ≳  10 for the spectral lag transition that was motivated as being due to quadratic Lorentz invariance violating model pointing to “decisive evidence”.

We derive a generalized phase diagram for the two-leg ladder system with tunable interaction strengths between chains allowing us to vary the shape of the lattice (from square to honeycomb ribbon or brickwall ladder). We evaluate the winding number associated with possible emergent (topological) gapless modes at the edges. In the Az phase, as a result of the emergent Z2 gauge fields and π-flux ground state, one may build spin-1/2 (loop) qubit operators by analogy to the toric code. In addition, we show how the intermediate gapless B phase evolves in the generalized ladder model. For the brick-wall ladder, the B phase is reduced to one line, which is analyzed through perturbation theory in a rung tensor product states representation and bosonization. Finally, we show that doping with a few holes can result in the formation of hole pairs and leads to a mapping with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in polyacetylene; a superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition for these hole pairs is accessible, as well as related topological properties.",1

In good agreement with previous studies, we find the DCBH number density rises from ∼10^−6.1 to ∼10^−3.5 cMpc^−3 from z ≃ 17.5 to 8 in the CDM model using a critical LW background value of 30J_21 (where J_21 = 10^−21 erg s^−1 Hz^−1 cm^−2 sr^−1). We find that a combination of delayed structure formation and an accelerated assembly of galaxies results in a later metal-enrichment and an accelerated build-up of the LW background in the 1.5 keV WDM model, resulting in DCBH hosts persisting down to much lower redshifts (z ≃ 5) as compared to CDM where DCBH hosts only exist down to z ≃ 8. We end by showing how the expected colours in three different bands of the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope can be used to hunt for potential z ≃ 5–9 DCBHs, allowing hints on the WDM particle mass.",1
30553,2,"The isospin dependent nucleon-nucleon inelastic cross section in the nuclear medium The calculation of the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent Δ production cross sections in nucleon–nucleon (NN) scattering σNN→NΔ⁎ has been performed within the framework of the relativistic BUU approach. The NΔ cross sections are calculated in Born approximation taking into account the effective mass splitting of the nucleons and Δs in asymmetric matter. Due to the different mass splitting for neutron, proton and differently charged Δs, it is shown that, similar to the NN elastic ones, the reductions of NΔ inelastic cross sections in isospin-asymmetric nuclear medium are different from each other for all the individual channels and the effect is largest and of opposite sign for the Δ++ and Δ− states. This approach is also compared to calculations without effective mass splitting and with splitting derived from Dirac–Brueckerner (DB) calculations. The isospin dependence of the NΔ cross sections is expected to influence the production of π+ and π− mesons as well as their yield ratio, and thus affect the use of the latter quantity as a probe of the stiffness of the symmetry energy at supranormal densities.",1

It is shown that the contribution of the inhomogeneous term at the ground state can be neglected when the system-size N tends to infinity, which enables us to reduce the inhomogeneous Bethe ansatz equations (BAEs) to the homogeneous ones. Then the quantum numbers at the ground states are obtained, by which the system with arbitrary size can be studied. We also calculate the twisted boundary energy of the system.",1
30579,2,"Quantum calculation of the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation by twisted electrons We present a detailed quantum electrodynamical description of Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation emitted by a relativistic twisted electron in the transparent medium. Simple expressions for the spectral and spectral-angular distributions as well as for the polarization properties of the emitted radiation are obtained. Unlike the plane-wave case, the twisted electron produces radiation within the annular angular region, with enhancement towards its boundaries. Additionally, the emitted photons can have linear polarization not only in the scattering plane but also in the orthogonal direction. We find that the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation emitted by an electron in a superposition of two vortex states exhibits a strong azimuthal asymmetry. Thus, the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation offers itself as a convenient diagnostic tool of such electrons and complements the traditional microscopic imaging.",1
30670,2,"Jet-driven and jet-less fireballs from compact binary mergers During a compact binary merger involving at least one neutron star (NS), a small fraction of the gravitational energy could be liberated in such a way to accelerate a small fraction (∼10^−6) of the NS mass in an isotropic or quasi-isotropic way. In presence of certain conditions, a pair-loaded fireball can form, which undergoes accelerated expansion reaching relativistic velocities. As in the standard fireball scenario, internal energy is partly transformed into kinetic energy. At the photospheric radius, the internal radiation can escape, giving rise to a pulse that lasts for a time equal to the delay time since the merger. The subsequent interaction with the interstellar medium can then convert part of the remaining kinetic energy back into radiation in a weak isotropic afterglow at all wavelengths. This scenario does not require the presence of a jet: the associated isotropic prompt and afterglow emission should be visible for all NS–NS and BH–NS mergers within 90 Mpc, independent of their inclination. The prompt emission is similar to that expected from an off-axis jet, either structured or much slower than usually assumed (Γ ∼ 10), or from the jet cocoon. The predicted afterglow emission properties can discriminate among these scenarios.",1

30830,2,"Personalization and Data Relation Exploration using Predictive Analytics for the Production and Distributed Analysis System (PanDA) Efficient data distribution among computing centers is one of the biggest challenges in large-scale scientific distributed computing systems. Such data distribution issues include: i) the rational utilization of storage and computing resources, ii) the minimization of the completion time for data processing (which requires a reduction in redundant data transfers, and intelligent allocation of processing tasks), and iii) user experience enhancement, i.e., availability and fast access to the desired data, and discovery of new relevant data. In the literature and in practice, there have been significant new approaches to the improvement of workflow management to address the above described issues, especially the first two. However, scientific computing systems usually miss out on enhancing user experience, although significant improvements could be done by exploring the relationships between the involved entities, e.g., inter-user, user-data relationships. Such revealed relationships would not only be to the benefit of the users, but could also improve data distribution strategies. The focus of this dissertation is on the discovery of hidden correlations between users and corresponding data, and on the interpretation of the reasons of those correlations in terms of a quantitative assessment. The scientific computing system on which this research is focused is the pilot-job based workload management system called PanDA (Production and Distributed Analysis) that operates at the ATLAS experiment. The dissertation describes a research effort that was conducted to detect data usage patterns in PanDA to validate a thesis that a recommender system would enhance user experience as well as provide important data with which scheduling of computing tasks could be improved. Data mining techniques are investigated and applied to estimate the correlation between users’ data needs, and to collect and manage groupings of data (based on data origin and usage patterns) and users (based on interests and data usage history). This work also presents the design of Data Watcher, a system that can create and maintain user models and thus reveal relationships between users and data. The goal is to be able to analyze, model, and predict user preferences based on estimated ratings and user provided feedback. The core analytics of Data Watcher is based on various recommender system techniques to provide methods in assisting users in finding interesting data (i.e., data similar to what the user has used previously, or relevant data that similar users have used). More precisely, Data Watcher i) can predict the degree of users’ potential interest in particular data, ii) dynamically forms groups of similar objects (groups of similar users, and data collections), and iii) maintains data popularity metrics based on implicit and explicit ratings.",1
30875,2,"No-signaling principle and Bell inequality in ${\mathcal{PT}}$ -symmetric quantum mechanics ${\mathcal{PT}}$ -symmetric quantum mechanics, the extension of conventional quantum mechanics to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian invariant under the combined parity (${\mathcal{P}}$ ) and time reversal (${\mathcal{T}}$ ) symmetry, has been successfully applied to a variety of fields—such as solid state physics, mathematical physics, optics, quantum field theory. Recently, the extension of ${\mathcal{PT}}$ -symmetrical theory to entangled quantum systems has been challenged, in that ${\mathcal{PT}}$ formulation within the conventional Hilbert space violates the no-signaling principle. Here, we revisit the derivation of non-signaling principle in the framework of ${\mathcal{CPT}}$ inner product prescription. Our results preserve the no-signaling principle for a two-qubit system, reaffirm the invariance of the entanglement, and reproduce the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH) inequality.

30928,2,"Development of the charge exchange type beam scraper system at the J-PARC Improvement in injection beam quality at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex 3-GeV rapid cycle synchrotron is to mitigate beam loss at the injection section. We developed a charge-exchange type scraper system with a thin carbon foil to collimate the beam halo in the injection beam line of the synchrotron. The key issue to realize the scraper is a reduction of the beam loss induced by the multiple-scattering effect of charge-exchange foil placed at the scraper head. In order to determine the adequate foil thickness, a charge-exchange efficiency of a carbon foil and particle-tracking simulation study of the collimated beam have been performed assuming a realistic halo at the scraper section. Using the results of this study, we chose the thickness of a 520μg/cm2 as the scraper foils to mitigate radiation dose around the L3BT scraper section. A charge-exchange scraper system that prevents the emission of radioactive fragments of the carbon foil was build. The system was put into operation to prove its effectiveness in eliminating the beam halo. From the result of a preliminary beam experiments, we confirmed that the installed scrapers eliminate a transverse beam tail or halo. After two days of operation with beam collimation, the radiation dose level around the scraper section was a tolerable one for the hands-on maintenance.",1
30995,2,"MOND impact on and of the recently updated mass-discrepancy-acceleration relation McGaugh et al. (2016) have used their extensive SPARC sample to update the well-known mass-discrepancy-acceleration relation (MDAR), which is one of the major predicted ""MOND laws"". This is not a newly discovered relation. Rather, it improves on the many previous studies of it, with more and better data. Like its precedents, it bears crucial ramifications for the observed dynamical anomalies in disc galaxies, and, in particular, on their resolution by the MOND paradigm. Their result, indeed, constitute a triumph for MOND. However, unlike previous analyses of the MDAR, McGaugh et al. have chosen to obfuscate the MOND roots of their analysis, and its connection with, and implications for, this paradigm. For example, the fitting formula they use, seemingly as a result of some unexplained inspiration, follows in its salient properties from the basic tenets of MOND, and has already been used in the past in several MOND analyses. No other possible origin for such a function is known. Given that this formula had already been shown to reproduce correctly the observed rotation curves from the baryon distribution (as a MOND effect), it must have been clear, a priory, that it should describe correctly the MDAR, which is but a summary of rotation curves. The present paper corrects these oversights -- bringing to light the deep connections with MOND, suppressed by McGaugh et al. It also gives due credit to previous works, and discusses some new, important, but less known, aspects of this MOND relation. (Substantially abridged.)",1
31014,2,"Extended Skyrme interactions for transport model simulations of heavy-ion collisions Based on an extended Skyrme interaction that includes the terms in relative momenta up to sixth order, corresponding to the so-called Skyrme pseudopotential up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO), we derive the expressions of Hamiltonian density and single nucleon potential under general non-equilibrium conditions which can be applied in transport model simulations of heavy-ion collisions induced by neutron-rich nuclei. While the conventional Skyrme interactions, which include the terms in relative momenta up to second order, predict an incorrect asymptotic behavior as a function of energy for nucleon optical potential in nuclear matter, the present extended N3LO Skyrme interaction can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential. In particular, we construct three interaction sets with different high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy, by fitting both the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of $1$ GeV and the empirical properties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. These extended N3LO Skyrme interactions will be useful in transport model simulations of heavy-ion collisions induced by neutron-rich nuclei at intermediate and high energies, and they can also be useful in nuclear structure studies within the mean-field model.",1

31027,2,"Unified Halo-Independent Formalism From Convex Hulls for Direct Dark Matter Searches Using the Fenchel-Eggleston theorem for convex hulls (an extension of the Caratheodory theorem), we prove that any likelihood can be maximized by either a dark matter 1- speed distribution F(v) in Earth's frame or 2- Galactic velocity distribution fgal(), consisting of a sum of delta functions. The former case applies only to time-averaged rate measurements and the maximum number of delta functions is (−1), where is the total number of data entries. The second case applies to any harmonic expansion coefficient of the time-dependent rate and the maximum number of terms is . Using time-averaged rates, the aforementioned form of F(v) results in a piecewise constant unmodulated halo function 0BF(vmin) (which is an integral of the speed distribution) with at most (-1) downward steps. The authors had previously proven this result for likelihoods comprised of at least one extended likelihood, and found the best-fit halo function to be unique. This uniqueness, however, cannot be guaranteed in the more general analysis applied to arbitrary likelihoods. Thus we introduce a method for determining whether there exists a unique best-fit halo function, and provide a procedure for constructing either a pointwise confidence band, if the best-fit halo function is unique, or a degeneracy band, if it is not. Using measurements of modulation amplitudes, the aforementioned form of fgal(), which is a sum of Galactic streams, yields a periodic time-dependent halo function BF(vmin, t) which at any fixed time is a piecewise constant function of vmin with at most downward steps. In this case, we explain how to construct pointwise confidence and degeneracy bands from the time-averaged halo function. Finally, we show that requiring an isotropic Galactic velocity distribution leads to a Galactic speed distribution F(u) that is once again a sum of delta functions, and produces a time-dependent BF(vmin, t) function (and a time-averaged 0BF(vmin)) that is piecewise linear, differing significantly from best-fit halo functions obtained without the assumption of isotropy.",1

31267,2,"The Fifth Force in the Local Cosmic Web Extensions of the standard models of particle physics and cosmology may lead to the presence of long-range fifth forces whose strength and range depend on gravitational environment. Fifth forces on astrophysical scales are best studied in the cosmic web where perturbation theory breaks down. We present precision constraints on a symmetron- or chameleon-screened fifth force with Yukawa coupling -- as well as an unscreened fifth force with differential coupling to galactic mass components -- on megaparsec scales by searching for the displacement it predicts between galaxies' stellar and gas mass centroids. Taking data from the ALFALFA HI survey, identifying galaxies' gravitational environments with the maps of Desmond et al. (2018) and forward-modelling with a Bayesian likelihood framework, we set upper bounds on the strength of the fifth force relative to Newtonian gravity, $\Delta G/G$, from $\sim 10^{-2}$ ($1\sigma$) for range $\lambda_C = 50$ Mpc to $\sim 10$ for $\lambda_C = 500$ kpc ($f_{R0}<10^{-6}$). The analogous constraints without screening are $\sim 10^{-2}$ and $10^{-1}$. These are the strongest and among the only fifth force constraints on galaxy scales.

31303,2,"Scattering of wave packets with phases A general problem of 2 → N$_{f}$ scattering is addressed with all the states being wave packets with arbitrary phases. Depending on these phases, one deals with coherent states in (3 + 1) D, vortex particles with orbital angular momentum, the Airy beams, and their generalizations. A method is developed in which a number of events represents a functional of the Wigner functions of such states. Using width of a packet σ$_{p}$ /〈p〉 as a small parameter, the Wigner functions, the number of events, and a cross section are represented as power series in this parameter, the first non-vanishing corrections to their plane-wave expressions are derived, and generalizations for beams are made. Although in this regime the Wigner functions turn out to be everywhere positive, the cross section develops new specifically quantum features, inaccessible in the plane-wave approximation. Among them is dependence on an impact parameter between the beams, on phases of the incoming states, and on a phase of the scattering amplitude. A model-independent analysis of these effects is made. Two ways of measuring how a Coulomb phase and a hadronic one change with a transferred momentum t are discussed.",1

It is found that to obtain good detector performance, the resistance ratio of the pads to the strips should be larger than 5, the nonuniformity of the pad surface resistivity should be less than 20%, a smaller pad width leads to a smaller spatial resolution, and when the pad width is 6 mm, the spatial resolution (σ) can reach about 105 μm.

In the present work we explore these scattering features in the domain of non-Hermitian space fractional quantum mechanics (SFQM) governed by fractional Schrodinger equation which is characterized by Levy index $\alpha$ ($ 1< \alpha \leq 2$). We observe that non-Hermitian SFQM systems have more flexibility for SS and CPA and display some new features of scattering. For the delta potential $V(x)=-i\rho \delta (x-x_{0})$, $\rho > 0$, the SS energy, $E_{ss}$, is blue or red shifted with decreasing $\alpha$ depending the strength of the potential. For complex rectangular barrier in non-Hermitian SQM, it is known that the reflection and transmission amplitudes are oscillatory near the spectral singular point. It is found that these oscillations eventually develop SS in non-Hermitian SFQM. The similar features is also reported for the case of CPA phenomena from complex rectangular barrier in non-Hermitian SFQM. These observations suggest a deeper relation between scattering features of non-Hermitian SQM and non-Hermitian SFQM.",1

The code is applicable for accurate beam dynamics simulations in cases where both bunch-to-bunch and intrabunch motions need to be taken into account, such as chromatic head-tail effects on the coupled-bunch instability of a beam with a nonuniform filling pattern, or multibunch and single-bunch effects of a passive higher-harmonic cavity. The numerical simulations have been compared with analytical studies. For a beam with an arbitrary filling pattern, intensity-dependent complex frequency shifts have been derived starting from a system of coupled Vlasov equations.

Modeling lens galaxies by a singular isothermal model and a central supermassive black hole, the photon mass-dependent part of the time delay between the compact images is shown to be proportional to the mass of the black hole.

31939,2,"Higher-dimensional inhomogeneous perfect fluid collapse in $f(R)$ gravity This paper is about the $n+2$ -dimensional gravitational contraction of an inhomogeneous fluid without heat flux in the framework of a f(R) metric theory of gravity. Matching conditions for two regions of a star are derived by using the Darmois junction conditions. For the analytic solution of the equations of motion in modified f(R) theory of gravity, we have taken the scalar curvature constant. Hence the final result of gravitational collapse in this framework is the existence of black hole and cosmological horizons, and both of these form earlier than the singularity. It is shown that a constant curvature term $f(R_{0})$ ( $R_0$ is the constant scalar curvature) slows down the collapsing process.",1
31966,2,Analysis of the Conformally Flat Approximation for Binary Neutron Star Initial Conditions The spatially conformally flat approximation (CFA) is a viable method to deduce initial conditions for the subsequent evolution of binary neutron stars employing the full Einstein equations. Here we analyze the viability of the CFA for the general relativistic hydrodynamic initial conditions of binary neutron stars. We illustrate the stability of the conformally flat condition on the hydrodynamics by numerically evolving ~100 quasicircular orbits. We illustrate the use of this approximation for orbiting neutron stars in the quasicircular orbit approximation to demonstrate the equation of state dependence of these initial conditions and how they might affect the emergent gravitational wave frequency as the stars approach the innermost stable circular orbit.,1
31970,2,"Relativistic dynamics, Green function and pseudodifferential operators The central role played by pseudodifferential operators in relativistic dynamics is known very well. In this work, operators like the Schrodinger one (e.g., square root) are treated from the point of view of the non-local pseudodifferential Green functions. Starting from the explicit construction of the Green (semigroup) theoretical kernel, a theorem linking the integrability conditions and their dependence on the spacetime dimensions is given. Relativistic wave equations with arbitrary spin and the causality problem are discussed with the algebraic interpretation of the radical operator and their relation with coherent and squeezed states. Also we perform by means of pure theoretical procedures (based in physical concepts and symmetry) the relativistic position operator which satisfies the conditions of integrability: it is a non-local, Lorentz invariant and does not have the same problems as the “local”position operator proposed by Newton and Wigner. Physical examples, as zitterbewegung and rogue waves, are presented and deeply analyzed in this theoretical framework.",1
32035,2,"Violation of statistical isotropy and homogeneity in the 21-cm power spectrum Most inflationary models predict primordial perturbations to be statistically isotropic and homogeneous. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, however, indicate a possible departure from statistical isotropy in the form of a dipolar power modulation at large angular scales. Alternative models of inflation, beyond the simplest single-field slow-roll models, can generate a small power asymmetry, consistent with these observations. Observations of clustering of quasars show, however, agreement with statistical isotropy at much smaller angular scales. Here, we propose to use off-diagonal components of the angular power spectrum of the 21-cm fluctuations during the dark ages to test this power asymmetry. We forecast results for the planned SKA radio array, a future radio array, and the cosmic-variance-limited case as a theoretical proof of principle. Our results show that the 21-cm line power spectrum will enable access to information at very small scales and at different redshift slices, thus improving upon the current CMB constraints by ∼2 orders of magnitude for a dipolar asymmetry and by ∼1–3 orders of magnitude for a quadrupolar asymmetry case.",1
32063,2,"A modified two-slit interferometer for characterizing the asymmetric lateral coherence of undulator radiation Recently we have shown that the asymmetric lateral coherence of betatron radiation is characterized by peculiar properties that are evidenced with the analysis of the coherence factor of radiation. We extend such results to radiation emitted by ultra-relativistic proton beams in a 2-periods undulator. Results of a 2-dimensional simulation show that the real analysis of the asymmetric lateral coherence substantially improves the resolving power, thus transverse beam non-uniformities and the beam size can be measured at large distance.",1
32175,2,"Perfect fluids coupled to inhomogeneities in the late Universe We consider the Universe at the late stage of its evolution and deep inside the cell of uniformity. At such scales, the Universe is highly inhomogeneous and is filled with inhomogeneities in the form of galaxies and groups of galaxies. We also suggest that the Universe is filled with a perfect fluid, and its fluctuations have peculiar velocities of the same (nonrelativistic) order of magnitude as for the inhomogeneities. In this sense, the inhomogeneities (e.g., galaxies) and fluctuations of perfect fluids are coupled to each other. We clarify some important points of this approach and present a brief review of previous studies (e.g., the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)model and a Chaplygin gas). We demonstrate that the perfect fluids which satisfy our approach are really coupled to galaxies, concentrating around them. The averaged (over the whole Universe) value of their fluctuations is equal to zero.",1
32214,2,"Classifying Potts critical lines We use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly determine the lines of renormalization group fixed points invariant under the permutational symmetry Sq in two dimensions, and we show how one of these scattering solutions describes the ferromagnetic and square lattice antiferromagnetic critical lines of the q-state Potts model. Other solutions we determine should correspond to new critical lines. In particular, we obtain that a Sq-invariant fixed point can be found up to the maximal value q=(7+17)/2. This is larger than the usually assumed maximal value 4 and leaves room for a second-order antiferromagnetic transition at q=5.",1
32283,2,Constant solutions of Yang-Mills equations and generalized Proca equations In this paper we present some new equations which we call Yang-Mills-Proca equations (or generalized Proca equations). This system of equations is a generalization of Proca equation and Yang-Mills equations and it is not gauge invariant. We present a number of constant solutions of this system of equations in the case of arbitrary Lie algebra. In details we consider the case when this Lie algebra is Clifford algebra or Grassmann algebra. We consider solutions of Yang-Mills equations in the form of perturbation theory series near the constant solution.,1
32297,2,"Remarks on inhomogeneous anisotropic cosmology Recently a new no-global-recollapse argument was given for some inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies that utilizes surface deformation by the mean curvature flow. In this paper we discuss important properties of the mean curvature flow of spacelike surfaces in Lorentzian manifolds. We show that singularities may form during cosmic evolution, and the theorems forbidding the global recollapse lose their validity. The time evolution of the spatial scalar curvature that may kinematically prevent the recollapse is determined in normal coordinates, which shows the impact of inhomogeneities explicitly. Our analysis indicates a caveat in numerical solutions that give rise to inflation.",1
32325,2,"Relativistic Time Dilation and Length Contraction in Discrete Space-Time using a Modified Distance Formula In this work, the relativistic phenomena of Lorentz contraction and time dilation are derived using a modified distance formula appropriate for discrete space. This new distance formula is different than Pythagoras's theorem but converges to it for distances large relative to the Planck length. First, four candidate formulas developed by different people over the last 70 years will be considered. Three of the formulas are shown to be identical for conditions that best describe discrete space; this equation is then used in the rest of the paper. It is shown that this new distance formula is applicable to all size-scales, from the Planck length upwards, and solves two major historical problems associated with a discrete space-time model. One problem it solves is maintaining isotropy in discrete space. The second problem it solves is the commonly perceived incompatibility of the model's concept of an immutable ""atom"" of space and the Lorentz contraction of this atom required by special relativity. With the new distance formula, it is shown that the Lorentz contraction of the atom of space does not occur regardless of the relative velocities of two reference frames. It is also shown that time dilation of the atom of time does not occur. Also discussed is the possibility of any object being able to travel at the speed of light for specific temporal durations derived in this work.",1
32330,2,"Particle-vortex symmetric liquid We introduce an effective theory with manifest particle-vortex symmetry for disordered thin films undergoing a magnetic field-tuned superconductor-insulator transition. The theory may enable one to access both the critical properties of the strong-disorder limit, which has recently been confirmed by Breznay et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 113, 280 (2016)PNASA60027-842410.1073/pnas.1522435113] to exhibit particle-vortex symmetric electrical response, and the nearby metallic phase discovered earlier by Mason and Kapitulnik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5341 (1999)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.82.5341] in less disordered samples. Within the effective theory, the Cooper-pair and field-induced vortex degrees of freedom are simultaneously incorporated into an electrically neutral Dirac fermion minimally coupled to a (emergent) Chern-Simons gauge field. A derivation of the theory follows upon mapping the superconductor-insulator transition to the integer quantum Hall plateau transition and the subsequent use of Son's particle-hole symmetric composite Fermi liquid. Remarkably, particle-vortex symmetric response does not require the introduction of disorder; rather, it results when the Dirac fermions exhibit vanishing Hall effect. The theory predicts approximately equal (diagonal) thermopower and Nernst signal with a deviation parameterized by the measured electrical Hall response at the symmetric point.",1
32339,2,"Numerical study of the thermal performance of the CERN Linac3 ion source miniature oven The Linac3 ion source at CERN produces lead ion beams by the vaporization of solid samples inside the internal ovens and the consequent ionization of the evaporated material in the plasma. The geometry, materials and surface state of the oven elements are critical parameters influencing the oven temperature characteristics and consequently the evaporation properties and the ion source performance. A dedicated test stand was assembled and a finite element approach is proposed to evaluate the thermal response of the system at increasing heating powers. Comparisons between the simulation results and experimental measurements are given in order to validate the numerical model. Radiation was found to be the main heat transfer mechanism governing the system. Based on the obtained results, improvements to the existing setup are analysed.",1
32384,2,"Scalar Fields in Numerical General Relativity: Inhomogeneous inflation and asymmetric bubble collapse Einstein's field equation of General Relativity (GR) has been known for over 100 years, yet it remains challenging to solve analytically in strongly relativistic regimes, particularly where there is a lack of a priori symmetry. Numerical Relativity (NR) - the evolution of the Einstein Equations using a computer - is now a relatively mature tool which enables such cases to be explored. In this thesis, a description is given of the development and application of a new Numerical Relativity code, GRChombo. GRChombo uses the standard BSSN formalism, incorporating full adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and massive parallelism via the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The AMR capability permits the study of physics which has previously been computationally infeasible in a full 3+1 setting. The functionality of the code is described, its performance characteristics are demonstrated, and it is shown that it can stably and accurately evolve standard spacetimes such as black hole mergers. We use GRChombo to study the effects of inhomogeneous initial conditions on the robustness of small and large field inflationary models. and investigate the critical behaviour which occurs in the collapse of both spherically symmetric and asymmetric scalar field bubbles.",1
32431,2,"Electric-Field-Induced Spin Resonance in Antiferromagnetic Insulators: Inverse Process of the Dynamical Chiral Magnetic Effect We propose a realization of the electric-field-induced antiferromagnetic resonance. We consider three-dimensional antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit coupling characterized by the existence of a topological term called the θ term. By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the presence of the θ term, we show that, in contrast to conventional methods using ac magnetic fields, the antiferromagnetic resonance state is realized by ac electric fields along with static magnetic fields. This mechanism can be understood as the inverse process of the dynamical chiral magnetic effect, an alternating current generation by magnetic fields. In other words, we propose a way to electrically induce the dynamical axion field in condensed matter. We discuss a possible experiment to observe our proposal, which utilizes the spin pumping from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a heavy metal contact.",1
32527,2,"Lévy Distributions for One-Dimensional Analysis of the Bose–Einstein Correlations A general study of relations between the parameters of two centrally symmetric Lévy distributions, often used for one-dimensional investigation of Bose–Einstein correlations, is given for the first time. These relations of the strength of correlations and of the radius of the emission region take into account possible various finite ranges of the Lorentz invariant four-momentum difference for two centrally symmetric Lévy distributions. In particular, special cases of the relations are investigated for Cauchy and normal (Gaussian) distributions. The mathematical formalism is verified using the recent measurements given that a generalized centrally symmetric Lévy distribution is used. The reasonable agreement is observed between estimations and experimental results for all available types of strong interaction processes and collision energies.",1
32534,2,"Electromagnetic description of three-dimensional time-reversal invariant ponderable topological insulators A general technique to analyze the classical interaction between ideal topological insulators, and electromagnetic sources and fields, has been previously elaborated. Nevertheless it is not immediately applicable in the laboratory as it fails to describe real ponderable media. In this work we provide a description of real topologically insulating materials taking into account their dielectric and magnetic properties. For inhomogeneous permittivity and permeability, the problem of finding the Green’s function must be solved in an ad hoc manner. Nevertheless, the physically feasible cases of piecewise constant ϵ, μ and θ make the problem tractable, where θ encodes the topological magnetoelectric polarizability properties of the medium. To this end we employ the Green’s function method to find the fields resulting from the interaction between these materials and electromagnetic sources. Furthermore we exploit the fact that in the cases here studied, the full Green’s function can be successfully found if the Green’s function of the corresponding ponderable media with θ=0 is known. Our results satisfactorily reproduce previously existing ones and also generalize some others. The method here elaborated can be exploited to determine the electromagnetic fields for more general configurations aiming to measure the interaction between real 3D topological insulators and electromagnetic fields.",1

For the second equation, the exact solutions are given in closed form for the potentials as constants and exponents. For the same equation, the exact solutions for a quadratic potential are written in the form of a series in the attractor and spiral areas (inflation stage and the late-time acceleration of the universe, respectively). Also the exact solutions for every arbitrary potential are given in the neighborhood of endpoint and infinity. The existence of all these classical solutions is proven.",1

We determine the detailed form of the momentum distribution, the structure of the one-body density matrix, and the pairing properties encoded in the two-body density matrix. From the low- and high-momentum scaling behavior of the single-particle momentum distribution we estimate the speed of sound and Tan's contact, respectively. Both quantities are found to be in agreement with previous calculations.

Our method is a natural yet non-trivial generalization of similar methods developed for the XXX spin chain.

32852,2,"Isospin-Asymmetry Dependence of the Thermodynamic Nuclear Equation of State in Many-Body Perturbation Theory The computation of the thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter is a central task of theoretical nuclear physics. The nuclear equation of state is an essential quantity in nuclear astrophysics and governs the properties of neutron stars and core-collapse supernov\ae. The framework of chiral effective field theory provides the basis for the description of nuclear interactions in terms of a systematic low-energy expansion. In this thesis, we apply chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions in perturbative many-body calculations of the thermodynamic equation of state of infinite homogeneous nuclear matter. The conceptual issues that arise concerning the consistent generalization of the standard zero-temperature form of many-body perturbation theory to finite temperatures are investigated in detail. The structure of many-body perturbation theory at higher orders is examined, in particular concerning the role of the so-called anomalous contributions. The first-order nuclear liquid-gas phase transition is analyzed with respect to its dependence on temperature and the neutron-to-proton ratio. Furthermore, the convergence behavior of the expansion of the equation of state in terms of the isospin asymmetry is examined. It is shown that the expansion coefficients beyond the quadratic order diverge in the zero-temperature limit, implying a nonanalytic form of the isospin-asymmetry dependence at low temperatures. This behavior is associated with logarithmic terms in the isospin-asymmetry dependence at zero temperature.",1
32863,2,"Hot and dense matter beyond relativistic mean field theory Properties of hot and dense matter are calculated in the framework of quantum hadrodynamics by including contributions from two-loop (TL) diagrams arising from the exchange of isoscalar and isovector mesons between nucleons. Our extension of mean field theory (MFT) employs the same five density-independent coupling strengths which are calibrated using the empirical properties at the equilibrium density of isospin-symmetric matter. Results of calculations from the MFT and TL approximations are compared for conditions of density, temperature, and proton fraction encountered in the study of core-collapse supernovae, young and old neutron stars, and mergers of compact binary stars. The TL results for the equation of state (EOS) of cold pure neutron matter at sub- and near-nuclear densities agree well with those of modern quantum Monte Carlo and effective field-theoretical approaches. Although the high-density EOS in the TL approximation for cold and β-equilibrated neutron-star matter is substantially softer than its MFT counterpart, it is able to support a 2M⊙ neutron star required by recent precise determinations. In addition, radii of 1.4M⊙ stars are smaller by ∼1 km than those obtained in MFT and lie in the range indicated by analysis of astronomical data. In contrast to MFT, the TL results also give a better account of the single-particle or optical potentials extracted from analyses of medium-energy proton-nucleus and heavy-ion experiments. In degenerate conditions, the thermal variables are well reproduced by results of Landau's Fermi-liquid theory in which density-dependent effective masses feature prominently. The ratio of the thermal components of pressure and energy density expressed as Γth=1+(Pth/εth), often used in astrophysical simulations, exhibits a stronger dependence on density than on proton fraction and temperature in both MFT and TL calculations. The prominent peak of Γth at supranuclear density found in MFT is, however, suppressed in TL calculations. This outcome is analogous to results of nonrelativistic models when exchange contributions from finite-range interactions are included in addition to those of contact interactions.",1

32922,2,"Isovector properties of the nuclear equation of state from the quark-meson coupling model The nucleon-nucleon interaction is an important requirement for investigations of nuclear struc- ture and reactions, as well as for astrophysical models such as r-process nucleosynthesis and neutron stars. The traditional approach to low-energy nuclear physics is to treat nucleons as immutable objects interacting via phenomenological forces. The use of phenomenological inter- actions, rather than one derived from a microscopic theory, raises questions as to the reliability of predictions for exotic regions of the nuclear chart. The quark-meson coupling (QMC) model uses a relativistic mean-field approach to provide a microscopically derived nucleon-nucleon interac- tion, which takes into account the quark structure of the nucleon. The Skyrme energy density functional is a popular phenomenological tool in studies of nuclear structure and reactions. In this work, the QMC density functional was used to produce a set of Skyrme parameterisations, in the hopes that they will give more reliable predictions for ex- otic nuclei. In conjunction with Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations, the Skyrme-QMC (SQMC) parameterisations have been used to model the ground-state properties of individual nu- clei. From this, one can investigate the importance of the isovector terms of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, which are particularly significant for exotic, neutron-rich regions of the nuclear chart. One of the notable successes of the QMC model is its derivation of nuclear spin-orbit coupling. The isovector dependence of the spin-orbit equation of state is remarkably similar to that of the modern UNEDF1 phenomenological density functional. HFB calculations along the Sn isotopic chain reveal that the isovector properties of the spin-orbit term impact binding energies to a level that will be significant for astrophysical r-process modelling.",1

The exact solution of the Einstein’s field equations are derived by using Lie point symmetry analysis method that yield two models of invariant universe for symmetries X(1) and X(3). The model with symmetries X(1) begins with big bang singularity while the model with symmetries X(3) does not favor the big bang singularity.

32987,2,"STAR Online Meta-Data Collection Framework: Integration with the Pre-existing Controls Infrastructure One of the STAR experiment’s modular Messaging Interface and Reliable Architecture framework (MIRA) integration goals is to provide seamless and automatic connections with the existing control systems. After an initial proof of concept and operation of the MIRA system as a parallel data collection system for online use and real-time monitoring, the STAR Software and Computing group is now working on the integration of Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) with MIRA’s interfaces. This integration goals are to allow functional interoperability and, later on, to replace the existing/legacy Detector Control System components at the service level. In this report, we describe the evolutionary integration process and, as an example, will discuss the EPICS Alarm Handler conversion. We review the complete upgrade procedure starting with the integration of EPICS-originated alarm signals propagation into MIRA, followed by the replacement of the existing operator interface based on Motif Editor and Display Manager (MEDM) with modern portable web-based Alarm Handler interface. To achieve this aim, we have built an EPICS-to-MQTT [8] bridging service, and recreated the functionality of the original Alarm Handler using low-latency web messaging technologies. The integration of EPICS alarm handling into our messaging framework allowed STAR to improve the DCS alarm awareness of existing STAR DAQ and RTS services, which use MIRA as a primary source of experiment control information.",1
33024,2,"Deep inelastic scattering on ultracold gases We discuss Bragg scattering on both Bose and Fermi gases with strong short-range interactions in the deep inelastic regime of large wave vector transfer q, where the dynamic structure factor is dominated by a resonance near the free-particle energy ℏω=ϵq=ℏ2q2/2m. Using a systematic short-distance expansion, the structure factor at high momentum is shown to exhibit a nontrivial dependence on frequency characterized by two separate scaling regimes. First, for frequencies that differ from the single-particle energy by terms of order O(q) (i.e., small deviations compared to the single-particle energy), the dynamic structure factor is described by the impulse approximation of Hohenberg and Platzman. Second, deviations of order O(q2) (i.e., of the same order or larger than the single-particle energy) are described by the operator product expansion, with a universal crossover connecting both regimes. The scaling is consistent with the leading asymptotics for a number of sum rules in the large momentum limit. Furthermore, we derive an exact expression for the shift and width of the single-particle peak at large momentum due to interactions, thus extending a result by Beliaev [J. Exp. Theor. Phys. 7, 299 (1958)0044-4510] for the low-density Bose gas to arbitrary values of the scattering length a. The shift exhibits a maximum around qa≃1, which is connected with a maximum in the static structure factor due to strong short-range correlations. For Bose gases with moderate interaction strengths, the theoretically predicted shift is consistent with the value observed by Papp et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 135301 (2008)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.101.135301]. Finally, we develop a diagrammatic theory for the dynamic structure factor which accounts for the correlations beyond Bogoliubov theory. It covers the full range of momenta and frequencies and provides an explicit example for the emergence of asymptotic scaling at large momentum.",1

33065,2,"Exotic quantum statistics from a many-body theory of Majorana fermions Starting with a simple counting argument, we construct a statistical and thermodynamic model of free Majorana fermions. Originally defined as a fermion identical to its own antiparticle state, Majorana particles often appear in the contemporary many-body literature as non-Abelian zero energy modes in topological superconductors. We deviate from the usual anyonic description and instead consider a gas of non-interacting, spin-1/2 Majorana fermions as Ettore Majorana first envisioned them. The existence of a fermionic ground state in such a system is heavily implied by standard quantum mechanical arguments and current theoretical insights from cold dark matter physics. This allows us to build a quantum statistical theory of the Majorana system in the low temperature, low density limit without the need to account for strong fluctuations in the particle number. A combinatorical analysis of the many-body Majorana ensemble leads to a configurational entropy which deviates from the fermionic result with an increasing number of available microstates. A Majorana distribution function is then derived which shows signatures of a sharply-defined Fermi surface at finite temperatures. The thermodynamics of such a system is shown to be nearly identical to that of a free Fermi gas, except now distinguished by a two-fold ground state degeneracy and, subsequently, a residual entropy at zero temperature. Experimental realization of the Majorana thermodynamics is then discussed in the context of superconductors, topological matter, and dense neutrino gases from supernovae emissions and relics from the Big Bang.",1

This oscillating monopole and antimonopole pair gives rise to ac Berry magnetic fields, responsible for the emergence of Berry electric fields, which have not been discussed before at least in the context of Weyl metals. Introducing this information into Boltzmann transport theory, we find anomalous Hall effects beyond Berry magnetic fields as a fingerprint of Berry electric fields.",1
33164,2,"Discrete spacetime, quantum walks and relativistic wave equations It has been observed that quantum walks on regular lattices can give rise to wave equations for relativistic particles in the continuum limit. In this paper, we define the three-dimensional discrete-time walk as a product of three coined one-dimensional walks. The factor corresponding to each one-dimensional walk involves two projection operators that act on an internal coin space; each projector is associated with either the “forward” or “backward” direction in that physical dimension. We show that the simple requirement that there is no preferred axis or direction along an axis—that is, that the walk be symmetric under parity transformations and steps along different axes of the cubic lattice be uncorrelated—leads, in the case of the simplest solution, to the requirement that the continuum limit of the walk is fully Lorentz-invariant. We show further that, in the case of a massive particle, this symmetry requirement necessitates the use of a four-dimensional internal space (as in the Dirac equation). The “coin flip” operation is generated by the parity transformation on the internal coin space, while the differences of the projection operators associated with each dimension must all anticommute. Finally, we discuss the leading correction to the continuum limit, and the possibility of distinguishing through experiment between the discrete random walk and the continuum-based Dirac equation as a description of fermion dynamics.",1

33213,2,"Landau quantization and neutron emissions by nuclei in the crust of a magnetar Magnetars are neutron stars endowed with surface magnetic fields of the order of 10(14) – 10(15) G, and with presumably much stronger fields in their interior. As a result of Landau quantization of electron motion, the neutron-drip transition in the crust of a magnetar is shifted to either higher or lower densities depending on the magnetic field strength. The impact of nuclear uncertainties is explored considering the recent series of Brussels-Montreal microscopic nuclear mass models. All these models are based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method with generalized Skyrme functionals. They differ in their predictions for the symmetry energy coefficient at saturation, and for the stiffness of the neutron-matter equation of state. For comparison, we have also considered the very accurate but more phenomenological model of Duflo and Zuker. Although the equilibrium composition of the crust of a magnetar and the onset of neutron emission are found to be model dependent, the quantum oscillations of the threshold density are essentially universal.",1
33257,2,"Integral measurement of the$^{12}$C(n, p)$^{12}$B reaction up to 10 GeV The integral measurement of the$^{12}$C(n, p)$^{12}$B reaction was performed at the neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF at CERN. The total number of$^{12}$B nuclei produced per neutron pulse of the n_TOF beam was determined using the activation technique in combination with a time-of-flight technique. The cross section is integrated over the n_TOF neutron energy spectrum from reaction threshold at 13.6MeV to 10GeV. Having been measured up to 1GeV on basis of the$^{235}$U(n, f ) reaction, the neutron energy spectrum above 200MeV has been re-evaluated due to the recent extension of the cross section reference for this particular reaction, which is otherwise considered a standard up to 200MeV. The results from the dedicated GEANT4 simulations have been used to evaluate the neutron flux from 1GeV up to 10GeV. The experimental results related to the$^{12}$C(n, p)$^{12}$B reaction are compared with the evaluated cross sections from major libraries and with the predictions of different GEANT4 models, which mostly underestimate the$^{12}$B production. On the contrary, a good reproduction of the integral cross section derived from measurements is obtained with TALYS-1.6 calculations, with optimized parameters.",1

33306,2,"Dynamical onset of superconductivity and retention of magnetic fields in cooling neutron stars A superconductor of paired protons is thought to form in the core of neutron stars soon after their birth. Minimum energy conditions suggest magnetic flux is expelled from the superconducting region due to the Meissner effect, such that the neutron star core is largely devoid of magnetic fields for some nuclear equation of state and proton pairing models. We show via neutron star cooling simulations that the superconducting region expands faster than flux is expected to be expelled because cooling timescales are much shorter than timescales of magnetic field diffusion. Thus magnetic fields remain in the bulk of the neutron star core for at least 106–107yr. We estimate the size of flux free regions at 107yr to be ≲100m for a magnetic field of 1011G and possibly smaller for stronger field strengths. For proton pairing models that are narrow, magnetic flux may be completely expelled from a thin shell of approximately the above size after 105yr. This shell may insulate lower conductivity outer layers, where magnetic fields can diffuse and decay faster, from fields maintained in the highly conducting deep core.",1
33319,2,"Post-Newtonian Gravity in Cosmology The post-Newtonian (PN) perturbative framework has been successful in understanding the slow-motion, weak field limit of Einstein's theory of gravity on solar system scales, and for isolated astrophysical systems. The parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism extended the PN framework to put very tight constraints on deviations from Einstein's theory on the aforementioned scales and systems. In this work, we extended and applied the post-Newtonian formalism to cosmological scales. We first used it to construct a cosmological model to understand the effect of regularly arranged point sources on the background expansion. Here we found that at higher orders we obtained a small radiation-like correction to the standard Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, for a matter-dominated universe. This radiation-like correction was purely due to the inhomogeneity of our model, and the non-linearity of Einstein's field equations. We also extended the post-Newtonian formalism to include other forms of matter that are cosmologically relevant, such as radiation and a cosmological constant, and studied the non-linear effects they might have on the background expansion. Then we constructed an extension of the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN) to cosmological scales. We used it to parameterize the background expansion of the universe as well as first-order perturbations in cosmology, using four functions of time. We gave examples of how our parameterization would work for dark energy models and scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories of gravity. In the final part of this work, we studied how light propagation behaves in an inhomogeneous post-Newtonian cosmology with matter and a cosmological constant. We used it to understand the effect that inhomogeneities would have on observables.",1

Effective mass of defect was proposed for investigation of conformal properties of the model at critical point. The volume dependence of defect’s mass at critical point and the Critical Casimir interaction of two defects were studied. It was shown that this Casimir interaction is attraction for any value of hopping parameter. The confinement of the defect on the defects line and the process of defects line collapse were studied. Applications in nanophysics and biophysics were discussed.,1

Several new properties of the projectors mapping onto one-dimensional subspaces, as well as their relations with three mutually different immersion formulas, namely, the generalized Weierstrass, Sym–Tafel and Fokas–Gelfand, have been discussed in detail. Explicit connections among these three surfaces are also established by purely analytical descriptions, and it is demonstrated that the three immersion formulas actually correspond to the single surface parametrized by some specific conditions.",1

33507,2,"Conceptual Design Report A Compact Photon Source We propose to build a shielded magnet that will act as an untagged bremsstrahlung photon source suitable for deployment in Hall A/C at Jefferson Lab. The goal of the project is a compact source which provides a narrow 1-mm diameter photon beam at the target with the intensity adequate to the polarized target operation. The proposed solution is based on the absorption of the electron beam in the magnet. The compactness is achieved by means of a shallow channel which leads to an electromagnetic shower in the Cu-W body of the channel and surrounding material after a 1-2~mm deflection of the beam electrons by a horizontal magnetic field. This source will allow us to achieve ten times the luminosity of the mixed electron--photon beam configuration while keeping the heat load on the (polarized) target as well as the radiation level in the experimental hall at acceptable levels. The concept for this device was developed for the experimental proposal PR12-15-003 but, if built, it would become a general--purpose source that would be usable for a variety of photon--induced reactions of interest in the 12-GeV era.",1
33587,2,"Transverse Feedback Parameter Extraction from Excitation Data In this paper we present a simple and fast approach to extract essential parameters of a transverse feedback system such as phase advances between pick-ups and kickers, fractional tune, kicker delay, or per-bunch transverse activity from discrete-time samples of position signals. In this approach the beam is excited and subsequent beam oscillations are recorded. Given that any number of pick-ups can be evaluated at once with only a marginal increase of transverse beam size this method is suitable for regular health checks of a transverse feedback system, e.g., for every injection. The fundamental idea relies on the reconstruction of the transverse phase space by means of digital filters. We sketch a simple mathematical model to illustrate the underlying method. Examples are given together with a set of filter kernels for the fractional tunes of the LHC transverse feedback system.",1
33598,2,"Exploring the Dark Universe: Constraint on dynamical dark energy models from CMB, BAO and Growth Rate Measurements In order to explain the current acceleration of the universe, the fine tuning problem of the value of $\Lambda$ and the cosmic coincidence problem, different alternative models have been proposed. We use the most recent observational data from CMB (Plank 13 + WMAP 9) and LSS (SDSS, WiggleZ, BOSS, CMASS) to put cosmological constraints on different dynamical dark energy models. We employ the CMB Shift Parameter, which traditionally has been used to constrain the main cosmological parameters of the standard model $\Lambda CDM$. BAO data are also used including the cross-correlation WiggleZ-BOSS data (BW), which have the potential to strongly constrain the history of the cosmological expansion and the main properties of dark energy. Additionally we use data from Redshift-Space Distortions through Growth Parameter $A(z)=f(z)\sigma_{8}(z)$ to put constraints on the variance in mass fluctuations $\sigma_{8}$. We study the expansion history trougth H(z), q(z) and j(z) parameters (Obtained from an expansion in Taylor series of the scale factor $a(t)$) with data from BAO, where we found that at low redshift appears an peculiar behavior of slowdown of aceleration, which occurs only on dynamical dark energy models. On the other hand, using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC, BIC) we found that $\omega CDM$ model is the most favored by the observational tests used in this work, including data from SNIa, GRBs, Strong Gravitational Lensisng (SGL) and gas mass fraction $f_{gas}$ in galaxy clusters.",1

The detector has been tested by using the X-ray tube (8~keV). The spatial resolution of the detector is about $103.46~\mathrm{{\mu}m}$ with the detector response part about $66.41~\mathrm{{\mu}m}$. The nonlinearity of the detector is less than $1.5\%$. A quite good two dimensional imaging capability is achieved as well.

Both effects have a simple geometric interpretation in terms of the signed volumes and directed areas of various subcomplexes of a “velocity polyhedron”: the convex hull formed by the end points of the velocity vectors of a superfluid mixture.

33693,2,"Constraints on the optical depth of galaxy groups and clusters Future data from galaxy redshift surveys, combined with high-resolutions maps of the cosmic microwave background, will enable measurements of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (kSZ) signal with unprecedented statistical significance. This signal probes the matter-velocity correlation function, scaled by the average optical depth (τ) of the galaxy groups and clusters in the sample, and is thus of fundamental importance for cosmology. However, in order to translate pairwise kSZ measurements into cosmological constraints, external constraints on τ are necessary. In this work, we present a new model for the intracluster medium, which takes into account star formation, feedback, non-thermal pressure, and gas cooling. Our semi-analytic model is computationally efficient and can reproduce results of recent hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation. We calibrate the free parameters in the model using recent X-ray measurements of gas density profiles of clusters, and gas masses of groups and clusters. Our observationally calibrated model predicts the average ${\tau }_{500}$ (i.e., the integrated τ within a disk of size R (500)) to better than 6% modeling uncertainty (at 95% confidence level). If the remaining uncertainties associated with other astrophysical uncertainties and X-ray selection effects can be better understood, our model for the optical depth should break the degeneracy between optical depth and cluster velocity in the analysis of future pairwise kSZ measurements and improve cosmological constraints with the combination of upcoming galaxy and CMB surveys, including the nature of dark energy, modified gravity, and neutrino mass.",1

This phase transition is expected to describe quantum criticality of the chiral XY class in the framework of the Gross-Neveu model, where, in the ordered phase, the $U(1)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken and a mass gap opens in the excitation spectrum. We compute the order parameter of the $s$-wave superconductivity and estimate the quasiparticle weight from the long-distance behavior of the single-particle Green's function. These calculations allow us to obtain the critical exponents of this transition in a reliable and accurate way. Our estimate for the critical exponents is in good agreement with those obtained for a transition to a Kekul\'{e} valence bond solid, where an emergent $U(1)$ symmetry is proposed [Z.-X.

Contrary to conventional understanding, we have succeeded in accelerating a 1 MW equivalent beam. The machine has some interesting features: e.g., the beam tends to be unstable for the smaller transverse beam size and the beam is stabilized by increasing the peak current. Space charge effects play an important role in the beam instability at the RCS. In this study, a new theory has been developed to calculate the beam growth rate with the head-tail and coupled-bunch modes (m,μ) while taking space charge effects into account. The theory sufficiently explains the distinctive features of the beam instabilities at the RCS.",1

Measurements will also concern the following scientific goals: detailed study of the Galactic center region, investigation of point and extended gamma-ray sources, studies of the energy spectra of Galactic and extragalactic diffuse emissions. To perform these measurements the GAMMA-400 gamma-ray telescope possesses unique physical characteristics for energy range from ~20 MeV to ~1000 GeV in comparison with previous and current space and ground-based experiments.

The special goal is to improve physical characteristics in the low- energy range from ~20 MeV to 100 MeV. Minimizing the amount of dead matter in the telescope aperture allows us to obtain the angular and energy resolutions better in this range than in current space missions.

34054,2,"3D Bunch-By-Bunch feedback system at ANKA to increase storable beam current In the ANKA storage ring, a digital state-of-the-art Bunch-by-Bunch (BBB) feedback system provides damping of Coupled-Bunch-Instabilities (CBI) in order to increase the maximum storable beam current and lifetime. Performance of this feedback strongly depends on the phase advance in the digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) ﬁlter. Especially during energy ramping, retuning of FIR ﬁlter parameters is required as the electron beam’s tune varies with changing machine optics. With this purpose, an algorithm for the automatic tuning of the ﬁlter is proposed. Tests performed during several energy rampings show an improvement in rejection of instabilities, which means the robustness of the feedback system against changes in machine settings is enhanced. Beam lifetime is also a critical parameter to evaluate performance of the storage ring. It is related to the bunch length in the longitudinal axis, which must be not too short to reduce beamloss. So as to increase the bunch length and thus enhance beam lifetime, beam modulation at the quadrupole resonance is applied in the longitudinal axis. An algorithm for the automatic conﬁguration of this modulation has been implemented and tested during injection. Results show a signiﬁcant enhancement of beam lifetime, but reproducibility of the obtained values will be discussed.",1

34216,2,"Rush the inspiral: efficient Effective One Body time-domain gravitational waveforms Computationally efficient waveforms are of central importance for gravitational wave data analysis of inspiralling and coalescing compact binaries. We show that the post-adiabatic (PA) approximation to the effective-one-body (EOB) description of the binary dynamics, when pushed to high-order, allows one to accurately and efficiently compute the waveform of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) or black holes (BBHs) up to a few orbits before merger. This is accomplished bypassing the usual need of numerically solving the relative EOB dynamics described by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Under the assumption that radiation reaction is small, the Hamilton's equations for the momenta can be solved {\it analytically} for given values of the relative separation. Time and orbital phase are then recovered by simple numerical quadratures. For the least-adiabatic BBH case, equal-mass, quasi-extremal spins anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, 6PA/8PA orders are able to generate waveforms that accumulate less than $10^{-3}$ rad of phase difference with respect to the complete EOB ones up to $\sim 3$ orbits before merger. Analogous results hold for BNSs. The PA waveform generation is extremely efficient: for a standard BNS system from 10Hz, a nonoptimized Matlab implementation of the TEOBResumS EOB model in the PA approximation is more than 100 times faster ($\sim 0.09$ sec) than the corresponding $C^{++}$ code based on a standard ODE solver. Once optimized further, our approach will allow to: (i) avoid the use of the fast, but often inaccurate, post-Newtonian inspiral waveforms, drastically reducing the impact of systematics due to inspiral waveform modelling; (ii) alleviate the need of constructing EOB waveform surrogates to be used in parameter estimation codes.",1

The spin and spin current densities are calculated by means of this distribution function at zero temperature up to the first order. It is shown that the nonequilibrium part of the distribution function yields the spin Hall effect for fermions constrained to move in a plane perpendicular to the angular velocity and magnetic field.

We then convert the fermion model into an inhomogeneous one dimensional model and express the partition function as a weighted sum over fermion worldline configurations. By imposing a pairing of fermion worldlines in half the space we show that all negative weight configurations can be eliminated.

One of fundamental principles can be explored by these new instruments is the equivalence principle, saying that gravitation and acceleration should be treated equivalently. If it is true this must lead to the appearance of the Unruh effect analogous to Hawking's black hole radiation. It says that a detector moving with a constant acceleration $w$ sees a boson's thermal bath with its temperature $T_w=\hbar w/2\pi k_B c$. Practical detection of the Unruh effect requires extremely strong acceleration and fast probing sources. Here we demonstrate that x-rays scattering from highly accelerated electrons can be used for such detection. We present two, feasible for the Unruh effect, designs for highly accelerated systems produced in underdense plasma irradiated by high intensity lasers pulses. The first is Thomson scattering of a XFEL pulse from plasma wave excited by an intense laser pulse. Properly chosen observation angles enable us to distinguish the Unruh effect from the normal Doppler shift with a reasonable photon number. The second is a system consisting of electron bunches accelerated by a laser wake-field, as sources and as detectors, which move in a constantly accelerating reference frame (Rindler space) and are probed by x-ray free electron laser pulses.

35103,2,"Do electromagnetic waves always propagate along null geodesics? We find exact solutions to Maxwell equations written in terms of four-vector potentials in non–rotating, as well as in Gödel and Kerr spacetimes. We show that Maxwell equations can be reduced to two uncoupled second-order differential equations for combinations of the components of the four-vector potential. Exact electromagnetic waves solutions are written on given gravitational field backgrounds where they evolve. We find that in non–rotating spherical symmetric spacetimes, electromagnetic waves travel along null geodesics. However, electromagnetic waves on Gödel and Kerr spacetimes do not exhibit that behavior.",1
35213,2,"Memories of a Theoretical Physicist While I was dealing with a brain injury and finding it difficult to work, two friends (Derek Westen, a friend of the KITP, and Steve Shenker, with whom I was recently collaborating), suggested that a new direction might be good. Steve in particular regarded me as a good writer and suggested that I try that. I quickly took to Steve's suggestion. Having only two bodies of knowledge, myself and physics, I decided to write an autobiography about my development as a theoretical physicist. This is not written for any particular audience, but just to give myself a goal. It will probably have too much physics for a nontechnical reader, and too little for a physicist, but perhaps there with be different things for each. Parts may be tedious. But it is somewhat unique, I think, a blow-by-blow history of where I started and where I got to. Probably the target audience is theoretical physicists, especially young ones, who may enjoy comparing my struggles with their own. Some disclaimers: This is based on my own memories, jogged by the arXiv and Inspire. There will surely be errors and omissions. And note the title: this is about my memories, which will be different for other people. Also, it would not be possible for me to mention all the authors whose work might intersect mine, so this should not be treated as a reference work.",1

We also formulate the underlying relation between the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the order parameter quantitatively.

BioLEIR would be operated when LEIR is not providing heavy ions for the CERN physics programme. The study group was mandated to write a Feasibility Study Report, using high-level engineering estimates based on previous experience, with the aim to: - collect the requirements for such a facility from the biomedical community in close collaboration with the International Strategy Committee for CERN Medical Applications; - determine a coherent set of beam parameters, based on the requirements; - explore whether the beam requirements can be met throughout the facility, from the source to the biomedical end-stations; - perform a feasibility study of the facility, taking into consideration the overall CERN schedules and programmes; - favour simplicity and robustness of the facility design, while minimizing the cost of maintenance and operation; - establish a high-level costing of material and personnel needed for project implementation; - describe the preferred installation scenario; - perform a high-level risk analysis for the project; - identify the areas of potential difficulty, and the required R&D should the study go ahead and become a project.",1
35477,2,"A software in the reinterpretation of model independent search results and constraining theories beyond the Standard Model One of the main tasks of the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is the general
search for new phenomena not described by the Standard Model, and the experimental
examination of speciﬁc postulated models and theories that extend the Standard Model
(called “BSM theories”). The standard approach for those tasks is the development of
many diﬀerent dedicated analyses, each optimized for one speciﬁc signature or model.
The “Model Unspeciﬁc Search in CMS” (MUSiC) project was developed as an alternative
approach to search for new phenomena: An automated scan for deviations between the
measured data and the Standard Model simulation is performed without optimizing with
respect to properties of the new phenomena. This approach addresses the problem of
missing a potential new signature hidden in the data because it is not being looked for.
This could happen since the large amount of possible extensions to the Standard Model
make it impossible to perform a dedicated search for all of them. Additionally, it could
be possible that a new phenomenon exists in the data for which no theory has been
developed, yet.
The project described in this thesis is an extension to the MUSiC analysis. The goal
is to provide information which can be used to restrain the allowed parameter space of
many of the previously mentioned theories for which no dedicated analyses have been
performed. For this purpose, model independent exclusion limits are calculated on the
number of signal events on top of the Standard Model expectation. The limits depend on
kinematic properties of the ﬁnal state in many diﬀerent event classes which are deﬁned
by the particle content of the ﬁnal state. The event and object reconstruction as well
as the Standard Model description and the event classiﬁcation used for this are shared
with the main MUSiC analysis [1] [2]. Once the model independent exclusion limits have
been calculated, they can be reinterpreted in terms of a new theory: For this purpose,
the total signal selection eﬃciency, depending on the same kinematic properties and
event classes used to calculate the limits, has to be calculated and applied to the model
independent limits in order to translate them into model speciﬁc limits.
As part of the project described in this thesis, a software framework called “MUSiC
Embedded Tool for Ascertaining Limits” (METAL) was developed which can be used to
calculate the model independent exclusion limits. It also provides a tool that performs
the reinterpretation in a fast and easy to use manner. The limit setting procedure as well
as the reinterpretation have been validated and a full set of limits has been calculated
for the proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector in the year 2012 at
a center of mass energy of 8 TeV.
The thesis is divided into three part: In the ﬁrst one, a short overview over the current
state of the Standard Model and the CMS detector as well as an introduction to the
statistical methods used in this analysis are given.
The second part contains a general description of the MUSiC data preparation and
event classiﬁcation as well as the simulation of the Standard Model expectation which is
also used by the METAL project. Additional details on that can be found in [1].
The third part contains the discussion of the exclusion limit calculation and the
reinterpretation method. Validation results for both aspects are given and example limits
are calculated for two BSM models which are then compared to the results of dedicated
analyses for the same models.

The aging of a counter with a 70%Ar + 30%CO$_{2}$ and a 60%Ar + 30%CO$_{2}$ + 10%СF$_{4}$ working mixture was stimulated by a$^{90}$Sr β source. To accelerate the process of aging, the gas mixture flow to the counter was supplied through a pipe with RTV coated wall. As a result, the amplitude of the signal decreased 70% already at accumulated charge of Q = 0.03 C/cm. The etching of the silicon compounds on the wire surface with an 80%CF$_{4}$ + 20%CO$_{2}$ gas mixture discharge led to full recovery of the operating characteristics of detector and an increase in the lifetime.

PIPER will map 85% of the sky at 200, 270, 350, and 600 GHz over a series of 8 conventional balloon flights from the northern and southern hemispheres.The first science flight will use two 32 × 40 arrays of backshort-under-grid transition edge sensors, multiplexed inthe time domain, and maintained at 100 mK by a Continuous Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator. Front-end cryogenic Variable-delay Polarization Modulators provide systematic control by rotating linear to circular polarization at 3 Hz. Twin telescopes allow PIPER to measure Stokes I, Q, U , and V simultaneously. The telescope is maintained at 1.5 K in an LHe bucket dewar. Cold optics and the lack of a warm window permit sensitivity at the sky-background limit. The ultimate science target is a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio ofr ∼ 0.007, from the reionization bump to l ∼ 300.

Based on seven years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) Pass 8 data, we report on a deep search for gamma-ray emission from AE Aqr. Using X-ray observations from ASCA, XMM-Newton, Chandra, Swift, Suzaku, and NuSTAR, spanning 20 years, we substantially extend and improve the spin ephemeris of AE Aqr. Using this ephemeris, we searched for gamma-ray pulsations at the spin period of the WD. No gamma-ray pulsations were detected above 3σ significance.

35786,2,"Nonlocal modified Einstein’s field equation and geometric origin of a small cosmological constant We show that the description of the spacetime in terms of backward-forward extension of its corresponding metric leads to the geometric origin of a small cosmological constant. The nonlocal cosmological constant appears in the Einstein’s field equation and its mathematical expression depends on the nonlocal metric, Ricci scalar and the infinitesimal nonlocal parameter introduced in the theory. The modified theory has interesting consequences in FRW cosmology, mainly a nonsingular universe, the occurrence of a late-time accelerated expansion of the universe and an early universe dominated by a negative energy density and a positive pressure. Our model can explain the acceleration of the universe without a fine-tuned cosmological constant $\Lambda$ .",1
35956,2,"Subaru Telescope limits on cosmological variations in the fine-structure constant Previous, large samples of quasar absorption spectra have indicated some evidence for relative variations in the fine-structure constant (Δα/α) across the sky. However, they were likely affected by long-range distortions of the wavelength calibration, so it is important to establish a statistical sample of more reliable results from multiple telescopes. Here we triple the sample of Δα/α measurements from the Subaru Telescope which have been ‘supercalibrated’ to correct for long-range distortions. A blinded analysis of the metallic ions in six intervening absorption systems in two Subaru quasar spectra provides no evidence for α variation, with a weighted mean of Δα/α = 3.0 ± 2.8_stat ± 2.0_sys parts per million (1σ statistical and systematic uncertainties). The main remaining systematic effects are uncertainties in the long-range distortion corrections, absorption profile models, and errors from redispersing multiple quasar exposures on to a common wavelength grid. The results also assume that terrestrial isotopic abundances prevail in the absorbers; assuming only the dominant terrestrial isotope is present significantly lowers Δα/α, though it is still consistent with zero. Given the location of the two quasars on the sky, our results do not support the evidence for spatial α variation, especially when combined with the 21 other recent measurements which were corrected for, or resistant to, long-range distortions. Our spectra and absorption profile fits are publicly available.",1
36044,2,"3D track reconstruction capability of a silicon hybrid active pixel detector Timepix3 detectors are the latest generation of hybrid active pixel detectors of the Medipix/Timepix family. Such detectors consist of an active sensor layer which is connected to the readout ASIC (application specific integrated circuit), segmenting the detector into a square matrix of 256 $\times $ 256 pixels (pixel pitch 55 $\upmu $ m). Particles interacting in the active sensor material create charge carriers, which drift towards the pixelated electrode, where they are collected. In each pixel, the time of the interaction (time resolution 1.56 ns) and the amount of created charge carriers are measured. Such a device was employed in an experiment in a 120 GeV/c pion beam. It is demonstrated, how the drift time information can be used for “4D” particle tracking, with the three spatial dimensions and the energy losses along the particle trajectory (dE/dx). Since the coordinates in the detector plane are given by the pixelation (x,y), the x- and y-resolution is determined by the pixel pitch (55  $\upmu $ m). A z-resolution of 50.4 $\upmu $ m could be achieved (for a 500 $\upmu $ m thick silicon sensor at 130 V bias), whereby the drift time model independent z-resolution was found to be 28.5  $\upmu $ m.",1
36053,2,"New multisymplectic approach to the Metric-Affine (Einstein-Palatini) action for gravity We present a covariant multisymplectic formulation for the Einstein-Palatini (or Metric-Affine) model of General Relativity (without energy-matter sources). As it is described by a first-order affine Lagrangian (in the derivatives of the fields), it is singular and, hence, this is a gauge field theory with constraints. These constraints are obtained after applying a constraint algorithm to the field equations, both in the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalisms. In order to do this, the covariant field equations must be written in a suitable geometrical way, using integrable distributions which are represented by multivector fields of a certain type. We obtain and explain the geometrical and physical meaning of the Lagrangian constraints and we construct the multimomentum (covariant) Hamiltonian formalism. The gauge symmetries of the model are discussed in both formalisms and, from them, the equivalence with the Einstein-Hilbert model is established.",1

It is well known that this is exactly the key point that Einstein used to realize a metric theory of gravitation having an unequalled beauty and elegance. On the other hand, the current requirements of particle physics and the open questions within extended gravity theories request a better understanding of the Equivalence Principle (EP).

D 93, 114025 (2016) the equations of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics were obtained from the moments of the Boltzmann equation based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic single-particle distribution function. In this paper we make a particular choice for this distribution function and consider the boost-invariant expansion of a fluid in one dimension. In order to close the conservation equations, we need to choose an additional moment of the Boltzmann equation. We discuss the influence of the choice of this moment on the time evolution of fluid-dynamical variables and identify the moment that provides the best match of anisotropic fluid dynamics to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation.",1

Unfortunately, relativistic definitions of them are not commonly known or appreciated.

In particular we consider the Abelian group Type 4A1; and thus the emerging homogeneous sub-space is flat. Through the use of coordinate transformations that preserve the sub-manifold's manifest homogeneity, a coordinate system is chosen in which the shift vector is zero. The resulting equations remain form invariant under the action of the constant Automorphisms group. This group is used in order to simplify the equations and obtain their complete solution space which consists of seven families of solutions.

Quasi-elastic and inelastic elementary processes contributing to the double differential cross sections of the reactions are described in terms of the exchange of virtual pions.

Relativity theory shows that the comparison of times measured by different clocks depends on their relative motions and on the strength of the gravitational field in which they are embedded. In standard cosmology, the time parameter is the one measured by fundamental clocks, i.e. clocks at rest with respect to the expanding space. This proper time is assumed to flow at a constant rate throughout the whole history of the Universe. We make the alternative hypothesis that the rate at which cosmological time flows depends on the global geometric curvature the Universe.

36664,2,"Origin of dissipative Fermi arc transport in Weyl semimetals By making use of a low-energy effective model of Weyl semimetals, we show that the Fermi arc transport is dissipative. The origin of the dissipation is the scattering of the surface Fermi arc states into the bulk of the semimetal. It is noticeable that the corresponding scattering rate is nonzero and can be estimated even in a perturbative theory, although in general the reliable calculations of transport properties necessitate a nonperturbative approach. Nondecoupling of the surface and bulk sectors in the low-energy theory of Weyl semimetals invalidates the usual argument of a nondissipative transport due to one-dimensional arc states. This property of Weyl semimetals is in drastic contrast to that of topological insulators, where the decoupling is protected by a gap in the bulk. Within the framework of the linear response theory, we obtain an approximate result for the conductivity due to the Fermi arc states and analyze its dependence on chemical potential, temperature, and other parameters of the model.",1

36724,2,"Orthogonal Polynomials from Hermitian Matrices II This is the second part of the project “unified theory of classical orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable derived from the eigenvalue problems of Hermitian matrices.” In a previous paper, orthogonal polynomials having Jackson integral measures were not included, since such measures cannot be obtained from single infinite dimensional Hermitian matrices. Here we show that Jackson integral measures for the polynomials of the big q-Jacobi family are the consequence of the recovery of self-adjointness of the unbounded Jacobi matrices governing the difference equations of these polynomials. The recovery of self-adjointness is achieved in an extended ℓ2 Hilbert space on which a direct sum of two unbounded Jacobi matrices acts as a Hamiltonian or a difference Schrödinger operator for an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem. The polynomial appearing in the upper/lower end of the Jackson integral constitutes the eigenvector of each of the two-unbounded Jacobi matrix of the direct sum. We also point out that the orthogonal vectors involving the q-Meixner (q-Charlier) polynomials do not form a complete basis of the ℓ2 Hilbert space, based on the fact that the dual q-Meixner polynomials introduced in a previous paper fail to satisfy the orthogonality relation. The complete set of eigenvectors involving the q-Meixner polynomials is obtained by constructing the duals of the dual q-Meixner polynomials which require the two-component Hamiltonian formulation. An alternative solution method based on the closure relation, the Heisenberg operator solution, is applied to the polynomials of the big q-Jacobi family and their duals and q-Meixner (q-Charlier) polynomials.",1

36780,2,"Polarization of Sunyaev–Zel'dovich signal due to electron pressure anisotropy in galaxy clusters We describe polarization of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) effect associated with electron pressure anisotropy likely present in the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM is an astrophysical example of a weakly collisional plasma where the Larmor frequencies of charged particles greatly exceed their collision frequencies. This permits formation of pressure anisotropies, driven by evolving magnetic fields via adiabatic invariance, or by heat fluxes. SZ polarization arises in the process of Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off the thermal ICM electrons due to the difference in the characteristic thermal velocities of the electrons along two mutually orthogonal directions in the sky plane. The signal scales linearly with the optical depth of the region containing large-scale correlated anisotropy, and with the degree of anisotropy itself. It has the same spectral dependence as the polarization induced by cluster motion with respect to the CMB frame (kinematic SZ effect polarization), but can be distinguished by its spatial pattern. For the illustrative case of a galaxy cluster with a cold front, where electron transport is mediated by Coulomb collisions, we estimate the CMB polarization degree at the level of 10^−8 (∼10  nK). An increase of the effective electron collisionality due to plasma instabilities will reduce the effect. Such polarization, therefore, may be an independent probe of the electron collisionality in the ICM, which is one of the key properties of a high-β weakly collisional plasma from the point of view of both astrophysics and plasma theory.",1

To solve the Einstein Podolsky Rosen 'paradox' the two boundary quantum mechanics is taken as self consistent interpretation of quantum dynamics. The difficulty with this interpretation is to reconcile it with classical physics. To avoid macroscopic backward causation two 'corresponding transition rules' are formulated which specify needed properties of macroscopic observations and manipulations. The apparent classical causal decision tree requires to understand the classically unchosen options. They are taken to occur with an 'incomplete knowledge' of the boundary states typically in macroscopic considerations. The precise boundary conditions with given phases then select the actual measured path and this selection is mistaken to happen at the time of measurement. The apparent time direction of the decision tree originates in an assumed relative proximity to the initial state. Only the far away final state allows for classically distinct options to be selected from. Cosmologically the picture could correspond to a big bang initial and a hugely extended final state scenario. It is speculated that it might also hold for a big bang/big crunch world. If this would be the case the Born probability postulate could find a natural explanation if we coexist in the expanding and the correlated CPT conjugate contracting world.,1
37099,2,"Time resolution of silicon pixel sensors We derive expressions for the time resolution of silicon detectors, using the Landau theory and a PAI model for describing the charge deposit of high energy particles. First we use the centroid time of the induced signal and derive analytic expressions for the three components contributing to the time resolution, namely charge deposit fluctuations, noise and fluctuations of the signal shape due to weighting field variations. Then we derive expressions for the time resolution using leading edge discrimination of the signal for various electronics shaping times. Time resolution of silicon detectors with internal gain is discussed as well.",1
37238,2,Stability of stationary-axisymmetric black holes in vacuum general relativity to axisymmetric electromagnetic perturbations We consider arbitrary stationary and axisymmetric black holes in general relativity in dimensions (with ) that satisfy the vacuum Einstein equation and have a non-degenerate horizon. We prove that the canonical energy of axisymmetric electromagnetic perturbations is positive definite. This establishes that all vacuum black holes are stable to axisymmetric electromagnetic perturbations. Our results also hold for asymptotically de Sitter black holes that satisfy the vacuum Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant. Our results also apply to extremal black holes provided that the initial perturbation vanishes in a neighborhood of the horizon.,1
37389,2,"Quenches near criticality of the quantum Ising chain---power and limitations of the discrete truncated Wigner approximation The semi-classical discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA) has recently been proposed as a simulation method for spin-$1/2$ systems. While it appears to provide a powerful approach which shows promising results in higher dimensions and for systems with long-range interactions, its performance is still not well understood in general. Here we perform a systematic benchmark on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and point to limitations of the approximation arising after sudden quenches into the quantum critical regime. Our procedure allows to identify the limitations of the semi-classical simulations and with that to determine the regimes and questions where quantum simulators can provide information which is inaccessible to semi-classics.",1

37503,2,"Separation of variables in Maxwell equations in Plebański-Demiański spacetime A new method for separating variables in the Maxwell equations in four- and higher-dimensional Kerr–(A)dS spacetimes proposed recently by Lunin is generalized to any off-shell metric that admits a principal Killing–Yano tensor. The key observation is that Lunin’s ansatz for the vector potential can be formulated in a covariant form—in terms of the principal tensor. In particular, focusing on the four-dimensional case we demonstrate separability of Maxwell’s equations in the Kerr–NUT–(A)dS and the Plebański–Demiański family of spacetimes. The new method of separation of variables is quite different from the standard approach based on the Newman–Penrose formalism.",1
37518,2,"Topological order, symmetry, and Hall response of two-dimensional spin-singlet superconductors Fully gapped two-dimensional superconductors coupled to dynamical electromagnetism are known to exhibit topological order. In this work, we develop a unified low-energy description for spin-singlet paired states by deriving topological Chern-Simons field theories for s-wave, d+id, and chiral higher even-wave superconductors. These theories capture the quantum statistics and fusion rules of Bogoliubov quasiparticles and vortices and incorporate global continuous symmetries—specifically, spin rotation and conservation of magnetic flux—present in all singlet superconductors. For all such systems, we compute the Hall response for these symmetries and investigate the physics at the edge. In particular, the weakly coupled phase of a chiral d+id chiral state has a spin Hall coefficient νs=2 and a vanishing Hall response for the magnetic flux symmetry. We argue that the latter is a generic result for two-dimensional superconductors with gapped photons, thereby demonstrating the absence of a spontaneous magnetic field in the ground state of chiral superconductors. It is also shown that the Chern-Simons theories of chiral spin-singlet superconductors derived here fall into Kitaev's 16-fold classification of topological superconductors.",1

37788,2,"De Sitter universe described by a binary mixture with a variable cosmological constant $\lambda $ We have constructed a self-consistent system of Bianchi Type VI$_{0}$ cosmology, and mingling of perfect fluid and dark energy in five dimensions. The usual equation of state $p = \gamma \rho $ with $\gamma \in [0, 1]$ is chosen by the perfect fluid. The dark energy assumed to be chosen is taken into consideration to be either the quintessence or Chaplygin gas. The same solutions pertaining to the corresponding the field equations of Einstein are obtained as a quadrature. State parameter’s equations for dark energy $\omega $ is found to be consistent enough with the recent observations of SNe Ia data (SNe Ia data with CMBR anisotropy) and galaxy clustering statistics. Here our models predict that the rate of expansion of Universe would increase with passage of time. The cosmological constant $\varLambda $ is traced as a declining function of time and it gets nearer to a small positive value later on which is supported by the results from the current supernovae Ia observations. Also a detail discussion is made on the physical and geometrical aspects of the models.",1
37803,2,"Partial Wave Decomposition in Friedrichs Model With Self-interacting Continua We consider the nonrelativistic model of coupling bare discrete states with continuum states in which the continuum states can have interactions among themselves. By partial-wave decomposition and constraint to the conserved angular momentum eigenstates, the model can be reduced to Friedrichs-like model with additional interactions between the continua. If a kind of factorizable form factor is chosen, the model can be exactly solvable, that is, the generalized discrete eigenstates including bound states, virtual states, and resonances can all be represented using the original bare states, and so do the in-state and out-state. The exact S matrix is thus obtained. We then discuss the behaviors of the dynamically generated S-wave and P-wave discrete states as the coupling is varying when there is only one self-interacting bare continuum state. We find that even when the potential is repulsive there could also be resonances and virtual states. In the P-wave cases with attractive interaction, we find that when there is a near-threshold bound state, there will always be an accompanying virtual state and we also give a more general argument of this effect.",1

Unlike earlier results, it is found that the phase diagram of the pasta phase does not depend much on L.",1
37873,2,"Easing Tensions with Quartessence Tensions between cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and the growth of the large-scale structure (LSS) inferred from late-time probes pose a serious challenge to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. State-of-the-art CMB data from the Planck satellite predicts a higher rate of structure growth than what preferred by low-redshift observables. Such tension has hitherto eluded conclusive explanations in terms of straightforward modifications to $\Lambda$CDM, e.g. the inclusion of massive neutrinos or a dynamical dark energy component. Here, we investigate `quartessence' models, where a single dark component mimics both dark matter and dark energy. We show that such models greatly alleviate the tension between high and low redshift observations, thanks to the non-vanishing sound speed of quartessence that inhibits structure growth at late times on scales smaller than its corresponding Jeans' length. In particular, the $3.4\sigma$ tension between CMB and LSS observables is thoroughly reabsorbed. For this reason, we argue that quartessence deserves further investigation and may lead to a deeper understanding of the physics of the dark Universe.",1

The model is constructed for the linear form f (R, T) = R + 2f (T). The exact solution of the field equations is obtained by using a time varying deceleration parameter q for a suitable choice of the function f (T). In this case, the bulk viscous pressure $ \overline{\mathrm{p}} $ is found to be negative and the energy density ρ is found to be positive. The obtained model is anisotropic, accelerating, and compatible with the results of astronomical observations. Also, some important features of physical parameters of this model have been discussed.",1
37879,2,"Effects of Homogeneous Plasma on Strong Gravitational Lensing of Kerr Black Holes Considering a Kerr black hole surrounded by the homogenous unmagnetised plasma medium, we study the strong gravitational lensing on the equatorial plane of the Kerr black hole. We find that the presence of the uniform plasma increases the photon-sphere radius $r_{ps}$, the coefficient $\bar{a},\bar{b}$, the angular position of the relativistic images $\theta_{\infty}$, the deflection angle $\alpha(\theta)$ and the angular separation $s$. However the relative magnitudes $r_m$ decrease in presence of the uniform plasma medium. It is also shown that the impact of the uniform plasma on the effect of strong gravitational become smaller as the spin of the Kerr black increace in prograde orbit($a>0$). Especially, for the extreme black hole(a=0.5), the effect of strong gravitational lensing in homogenous plasma medium is the same as the case in vacuum for the prograde orbit.",1
37905,2,"Three-nucleon bound states and the Wigner-SU(4) limit We examine the extent to which the properties of three-nucleon bound states are well-reproduced in the limit that nuclear forces satisfy Wigner’s SU(4) (spin–isospin) symmetry. To do this we compute the charge radii up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in an effective field theory that is an expansion in powers of R/a, with R the range of the nuclear force and a the nucleon–nucleon ( $N\!N$ ) scattering lengths. In the Wigner-SU(4) limit, the triton and helium-3 point charge radii are equal. At NLO in the range expansion both are 1.66 fm. Adding the first-order corrections due to the breaking of Wigner symmetry in the $N\!N$ scattering lengths gives a ${}^3\mathrm {H}$ point charge radius of 1.58 fm, which is remarkably close to the experimental number, $1.5978\pm 0.040$  fm (Angeli and Marinova in At Data Nucl Data Tables 99:69–95, 2013). For the ${}^3\mathrm {He}$ point charge radius we find 1.70 fm, about 4% away from the experimental value of $1.77527\pm 0.0054$  fm (Angeli and Marinova 2013). We also examine the Faddeev components that enter the tri-nucleon wave function and find that an expansion of them in powers of the symmetry-breaking parameter converges rapidly. Wigner’s SU(4) symmetry is thus a useful starting point for understanding tri-nucleon bound-state properties.",1

37941,2,"Overview of different control strategies for a typical cryogenic warm compressor station at CERN Helium cryogenic systems are extensively used at CERN under several configurations for accelerators and detectors. The Warm Compressor Station (WCS) is the primary component of the helium cryogenic systems.

In the process they emit a powerful burst of neutrinos, produce a variety of elements, and leave behind either a neutron star or a black hole. The wide mass range for SN progenitors results in diverse neutrino signals, explosion energies, and nucleosynthesis products. A major mechanism to produce nuclei heavier than iron is rapid neutron capture, or the r process. This process may be connected to SNe in several ways. A brief review is presented on current understanding of neutrino emission, explosion, and nucleosynthesis of SNe.",1
38004,2,"Approach for modelling quantum-mechanical collapse A long-standing quantum-mechanical puzzle is whether the collapse of the wave function is a real physical process or simply an epiphenomenon. This puzzle lies at the heart of the measurement problem. One way to choose between the alternatives is to assume that one or the other is correct and attempt to draw physical, observable consequences which then could be empirically verified or ruled out. As a working hypothesis, we propose simple models of collapse as a real physical process for direct binary symmetric measurements made on one particle. This allows one to construct irreversible unstable Schr\""odinger equations capable of describing continuously the process of collapse induced by the interaction of the quantum system with the measuring device. Due to unknown initial conditions the collapse outcome remains unpredictable so no contradictions with quantum mechanics arise. Our theoretical framework predicts a finite time-scale of the collapse and links with experiment. Sensitive probes of the collapse dynamics could be done using Bose-Einstein condensates, ultracold neutrons or ultrafast optics. If confirmed, the formulation could be relevant to the transition from quantum fluctuations to classical inhomogeneities in early cosmology and to establishing the ultimate limits on the speed of quantum computation and information processing.",1
38051,2,"Hot Spaghetti: Viscous Gravitational Collapse We explore the fate of matter falling into a macroscopic Schwarzschild black hole for the simplified case of a radially collapsing thin spherical shell for which the back reaction of the geometry can be neglected. We treat the internal dynamics of the in-falling matter in the framework of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics and calculate how the internal temperature of the collapsing matter evolves as it falls toward the Schwarzschild singularity. We find that viscous hydrodynamics fails when either the dissipative radial pressure exceeds the thermal pressure and the total radial pressure becomes negative, or the time scale of variation of the tidal forces acting on the collapsing matter becomes shorter than the characteristic hydrodynamic response time.",1

In addition, we see that multiple disconnected photon surfaces having the same values of the scalar field do not exist.",1
38197,2,"Shadows of Bonnor black dihole by chaotic lensing We numerically study the shadows of a Bonnor black dihole through the technique of backward ray tracing. The presence of a magnetic dipole yields nonintegrable photon motion, which sharply affects the shadow of the compact object. Our results show that there exists a critical value for the shadow. When the magnetic dipole parameter is less than the critical value the shadow is a black disk, but when the magnetic dipole parameter is larger than the critical value the shadow becomes a concave disk with eyebrows possessing a self-similar fractal structure. These behaviors are very similar to those of the equal-mass and nonspinning Majumdar-Papapetrou binary black holes. However, we find that the two larger shadows and the smaller eyebrow-like shadows are joined together by the middle black zone for the Bonnor black dihole, which is different from that in the Majumdar-Papapetrou binary black hole spacetime where they are disconnected. With the increase of the magnetic dipole parameter, the middle black zone connecting the main shadows and the eyebrow-like shadows becomes narrow. Our results show that the spacetime properties arising from the magnetic dipole yield interesting patterns for the shadow cast by a Bonnor black dihole.",1
38218,2,"Galactic Cosmic-Rays in a Breeze We study a scenario in which the Fermi bubbles are formed through a Galactocentric outflow of gas and pre-accelerated cosmic-rays (CR). We take into account CR energy losses due to proton-proton interactions with the gas present in the bubbles, and calculate the associated gamma-ray emission. We find that CRs diffusing and advecting within a breeze outflow result in an approximately flat surface brightness profile of the gamma-ray emission, as observed by Fermi satellite. Finally, we apply similar outflow profiles to larger Galactocentric radii, and investigate their effects on the CR spectrum and boron-to-carbon ratio.

38288,2,"Are ultracompact minihalos really ultracompact? Ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs) have emerged as a valuable probe of the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations at small scales. UCMHs are expected to form at early times in regions with δρ/ρ≳10-3, and they are theorized to possess an extremely compact ρ∝r-9/4 radial density profile, which enhances their observable signatures. Nonobservation of UCMHs can thus constrain the primordial power spectrum. Using N-body simulations to study the collapse of extreme density peaks at z≃1000, we show that UCMHs forming under realistic conditions do not develop the ρ∝r-9/4 profile and instead develop either ρ∝r-3/2 or ρ∝r-1 inner density profiles depending on the shape of the power spectrum. We also demonstrate via idealized simulations that self-similarity—the absence of a scale length—is necessary to produce a halo with the ρ∝r-9/4 profile, and we argue that this implies such halos cannot form from a Gaussian primordial density field. Prior constraints derived from UCMH nonobservation must be reworked in light of this discovery. Although the shallower density profile reduces UCMH visibility, our findings reduce their signal by as little as O(10-2) while allowing later-forming halos to be considered, which suggests that new constraints could be significantly stronger.",1

38465,2,"Spectrum of area in the Faddeev formulation of gravity Faddeev formulation of general relativity (GR) is considered where the metric is composed of ten vector fields or a ten-dimensional tetrad. Upon partial use of the field equations, this theory results in the usual general relativity (GR). Earlier, we have proposed first-order representation of the minisuperspace model for the Faddeev formulation where the tetrad fields are piecewise constant on the polytopes like four-simplices or, say, cuboids into which ℝ4 can be decomposed, an analogue of the Cartan–Weyl connection-type form of the Hilbert–Einstein action in the usual continuum GR. In the Hamiltonian formalism, the tetrad bilinears are canonically conjugate to the orthogonal connection matrices. We evaluate the spectrum of the elementary areas, functions of the tetrad bilinears. The spectrum is discrete and proportional to the Faddeev analog γF of the Barbero–Immirzi parameter γ. The possibility of the tetrad and metric discontinuities in the Faddeev gravity allows to consider any surface as consisting of a set of virtually independent elementary areas and its spectrum being the sum of the elementary spectra.

We implement an embedding class one condition to obtain a relation between the metric functions. We generalize the properties of a spherical star with hydrostatic equilibrium using the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. We match the interior solution to an exterior Reissner-Nordström one, and study the energy conditions, speed of sound, and mass-radius relation of the star.

Such quantum states of photons, electrons and neutrons have been generated experimentally in recent years, opening up new perspectives in quantum optics, electron microscopy, particle physics, and so forth. Here we discuss the non-plane-wave effects in scattering brought about by the novel quantum numbers of these wave packets. For the well-focused electrons of intermediate energies, already available at electron microscopes, the corresponding contribution can surpass that of the radiative corrections.

38637,2,"Absence of a Charge Diffusion Pole at Finite Energies in an Exactly Solvable Interacting Flat Band Model in d-dimensions Motivated by recent bounds for charge diffusion in critical matter, we investigate the following question: What sets the scale for the velocity for diffusing degrees of freedom in a scale-invariant system? To make our statements precise, we analyze the diffusion pole in an exactly solvable model for a Mott transition in the presence of a long-range interaction term. To achieve scale invariance, we limit our discussion to the flat-band regime. We find in this limit that the diffusion pole, which would normally obtain at finite energy, is pushed to zero energy, resulting in a vanishing of the diffusion constant. This occurs even in the presence of interactions in certain limits, indicating the robustness of this result to the inclusion of a scale in the problem. Consequently, scale invariance precludes any reasonable definition of the diffusion constant. Nonetheless, we do find that a scale can be defined, albeit irrelevant to diffusion, which is the product of the squared band velocity and the density of states.",1
38825,2,"Scaling within the Spectral Function approach Scaling features of the nuclear electromagnetic response functions unveil aspects of nuclear dynamics that are crucial for interpreting neutrino- and electron-scattering data. In the large momentum-transfer regime, the nucleon-density response function defines a universal scaling function, which is independent of the nature of the probe. In this work, we analyze the nucleon-density response function of C12, neglecting collective excitations. We employ particle and hole spectral functions obtained within two distinct many-body methods, both widely used to describe electroweak reactions in nuclei. We show that the two approaches provide compatible nucleon-density scaling functions that for large momentum transfers satisfy first-kind scaling. Both methods yield scaling functions characterized by an asymmetric shape, although less pronounced than that of experimental scaling functions. This asymmetry, only mildly affected by final state interactions, is mostly due to nucleon-nucleon correlations, encoded in the continuum component of the hole spectral function.",1
38844,2,"An exactly solvable quench protocol for integrable spin models Quantum quenches in continuum field theory across critical points are known to display different scaling behaviours in different regimes of the quench rate. We extend these results to integrable lattice models such as the transverse field Ising model on a one-dimensional chain and the Kitaev model on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice using a nonlinear quench protocol which allows for exact analytical solutions of the dynamics. Our quench protocol starts with a finite mass gap at early times and crosses a critical point or a critical region, and we study the behaviour of one point functions of the quenched operator at the critical point or in the critical region as a function of the quench rate. For quench rates slow compared to the initial mass gap, we find the expected Kibble-Zurek scaling. In contrast, for rates fast compared to the mass gap, but slow compared to the inverse lattice spacing, we find scaling behaviour similar to smooth fast continuum quenches. For quench rates of the same order of the lattice scale, the one point function saturates as a function of the rate, approaching the results of an abrupt quench. The presence of an extended critical surface in the Kitaev model leads to a variety of scaling exponents depending on the starting point and on the time where the operator is measured. We discuss the role of the amplitude of the quench in determining the extent of the slow (Kibble-Zurek) and fast quench regimes, and the onset of the saturation.",1

Assuming that the representation categories of interest are vertex tensor categories in the sense of Huang, Lepowsky and Zhang, a Schur-Weyl type duality for both simple and indecomposable but reducible modules is proven. Families of vertex algebra extensions of ${C}$ are found and every simple ${C}$-module is shown to be contained in at least one ${V}$-module. A corollary of this is that if ${V}$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite and CFT-type, and $\text{Com}\left( {C}, {V}\right)$ is a rational lattice vertex operator algebra, then so is ${C}$. These results are illustrated with many examples and the $C_1$-cofiniteness of certain interesting classes of modules is established.",1
39148,2,"Time-delayed electromagnetic radiation reaction The Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac (LAD) equation has proved valuable in describing the motion of radiating electric charges but suffers from runaway, pre-acceleration and other ambiguities. The usual scheme is problematic because of locality, which leads to self-interaction with the propagating radiation (i.e. real photons). Instead, the present heuristic model relies on an infinitesimal time delay between the action of external forces and the inertial reaction by the charge. This yields a new and pathology-free equation of motion whereas the radiated energy-momentum is expressed as an infinite series that generalises Larmor's formula and leads to testable predictions using current and near future ultra-intense lasers. The time-delay hypothesis is to be put in parallel with recently observed delays of order $10^{-18}$s (attosecond) in photoemission by atoms and small molecules. Such behaviour is extended here to elementary charges which are supposed to exhibit delays given by the time taken by light to cross the charge's classical radius, which gives $\approx 10^{-23}$s for an electron.",1

Here we show how type-II Dirac points-exotic Dirac relativistic waves yet to be discovered-are robustly realized through screw symmetry. The emergent type-II Dirac points carry nontrivial topology and are the mother states of type-II Weyl points. The proposed all-dielectric photonic-crystal architecture allows unprecidented control of electromagnetic waves, including robust ""open-cavity"" states at photonic-crystal-air interfaces and anomalous refraction, with low energy dissipation.",1

The Coulomb potential $Z\alpha /r$ is rounded to the constant $Z\alpha /R$ for $r < R$ . We confirm the resonant behavior of $\delta _{\varkappa }$ that we investigate in detail.

The torsion parameters change the spacetime structure which affects the photon sphere, the deflection angle and the strong gravitational lensing. The condition of existence of horizons is not inconsistent with that of the photon sphere. Especially, there exists a novel case in which there is horizon but no photon sphere for the considered spacetime. In this special case, the deflection angle of the light ray near the event horizon also diverges logarithmically, but the coefficients in the strong-field limit are different from those in the cases with photon sphere. Moreover, in the far-field limit, we find that the deflection angle for certain torsion parameters approaches zero from the negative side, which is different from those in the usual spacetimes.",1
39379,2,"Cosmological tests of gravity The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has come relatively late in our study of the cosmos, but in showing that gravity can act repulsively, it has opened up many new questions about the nature of gravity and what the Universe might contain. Is the acceleration being driven by dark energy? Or is general relativity (GR) itself in error, requiring a modification at large scales to account for the late acceleration? Structure formation in our Universe can be different even if the geometry of the homogeneous and isotropic universe is the same in these two classes of models, offering a possibility to distinguish between them observationally. Non-linear structure formation is complicated by the fifth force that commonly appears in modified gravity models and new techniques are required to analyse it. We will discuss novel methods to test GR on cosmological scales, building on the recent developments of N-body simulations for modified gravity.",1

39423,2,"Microscopically based energy density functionals for nuclei using the density matrix expansion. II. Full optimization and validation Background: Energy density functional methods provide a generic framework to compute properties of atomic nuclei starting from models of nuclear potentials and the rules of quantum mechanics. Until now, the overwhelming majority of functionals have been constructed either from empirical nuclear potentials such as the Skyrme or Gogny forces, or from systematic gradient-like expansions in the spirit of the density functional theory for atoms. Purpose: We seek to obtain a usable form of the nuclear energy density functional that is rooted in the modern theory of nuclear forces. We thus consider a functional obtained from the density matrix expansion of local nuclear potentials from chiral effective field theory. We propose a parametrization of this functional carefully calibrated and validated on selected ground-state properties that is suitable for large-scale calculations of nuclear properties. Methods: Our energy functional comprises two main components. The first component is a non-local functional of the density and corresponds to the direct part (Hartree term) of the expectation value of local chiral potentials on a Slater determinant. Contributions to the mean field and the energy of this term are computed by expanding the spatial, finite-range components of the chiral potential onto Gaussian functions. The second component is a local functional of the density and is obtained by applying the density matrix expansion to the exchange part (Fock term) of the expectation value of the local chiral potential. We apply the UNEDF2 optimization protocol to determine the coupling constants of this energy functional. Results: We obtain a set of microscopically constrained functionals for local chiral potentials from leading order up to next-to-next-to-leading order with and without three-body forces and contributions from Δ excitations. These functionals are validated on the calculation of nuclear and neutron matter, nuclear mass tables, single-particle shell structure in closed-shell nuclei, and the fission barrier of Pu240. Quantitatively, they perform noticeably better than the more phenomenological Skyrme functionals. Conclusions: The inclusion of higher-order terms in the chiral perturbation expansion seems to produce a systematic improvement in predicting nuclear binding energies while the impact on other observables is not really significant. This result is especially promising since all the fits have been performed at the single-reference level of the energy density functional approach, where important collective correlations such as center-of-mass correction, rotational correction, or zero-point vibrational energies have not been taken into account yet.",1
39704,2,"Mitigation of multipacting, enhanced by gas condensation on the high power input coupler of a superconducting RF module, by comprehensive warm aging Excitation of multipacting, enhanced by gas condensation on cold surfaces of the high power input coupler in a SRF module poses the highest challenge for reliable SRF operation under high average RF power. This could prevent the light source SRF module from being operated with a desired high beam current. Off-line long-term reliability tests have been conducted for the newly constructed 500-MHz SRF KEKB type modules at an accelerating RF voltage of 1.6-MV to enable prediction of their operational reliability in the 3-GeV Taiwan Photon Source (TPS), since prediction from mere production performance by conventional horizontal test is presently unreliable. As expected, operational difficulties resulting from multipacting, enhanced by gas condensation, have been identified in the course of long-term reliability test. Our present hypothesis is that gas condensation can be slowed down by preserving the vacuum pressure at the power coupler close to that reached just after its cool down to liquid helium temperatures. This is achievable by reduction of the power coupler out-gassing rate through comprehensive warm aging. Its feasibility and effectiveness has been experimentally verified in a second long term reliability test. Our success opens the possibility to operate the SRF module free of multipacting trouble and opens a new direction to improve the operational performance of next generation SRF modules in light sources with high beam currents.",1
39754,2,"Renyi relative entropies of quantum Gaussian states The quantum Renyi relative entropies play a prominent role in quantum information theory, finding applications in characterizing error exponents and strong converse exponents for quantum hypothesis testing and quantum communication theory. On a different thread, quantum Gaussian states have been intensely investigated theoretically, motivated by the fact that they are more readily accessible in the laboratory than are other, more exotic quantum states. In this paper, we derive formulas for the quantum Renyi relative entropies of quantum Gaussian states. We consider both the traditional (Petz) Renyi relative entropy as well as the more recent sandwiched Renyi relative entropy, finding formulas that are expressed solely in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices of the underlying quantum Gaussian states. Our development handles the hitherto elusive case for the Petz--Renyi relative entropy when the Renyi parameter is larger than one. Finally, we also derive a formula for the max-relative entropy of two quantum Gaussian states, and we discuss some applications of the formulas derived here.",1

We do so by formulating a minimalist Generalized Cohomology Hypothesis, which is satisfied by existing proposals and captures essential aspects of SPT classification. From this Hypothesis alone, formulas relating classifications in different dimensions and/or protected by different symmetry groups are derived.

40013,2,"Phases of dense matter in compact stars Formed in the aftermath of gravitational core-collapse supernova explosions, neutron stars are unique cosmic laboratories for probing the properties of matter under extreme conditions that cannot be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories. The interior of a neutron star, endowed with the highest magnetic fields known and with densities spanning about ten orders of magnitude from the surface to the centre, is predicted to exhibit various phases of dense strongly interacting matter, whose physics is reviewed in this chapter. The outer layers of a neutron star consist of a solid nuclear crust, permeated by a neutron ocean in its densest region, possibly on top of a nuclear ""pasta"" mantle. The properties of these layers and of the homogeneous isospin asymmetric nuclear matter beneath constituting the outer core may still be constrained by terrestrial experiments. The inner core of highly degenerate, strongly interacting matter poses a few puzzles and questions which are reviewed here together with perspectives for their resolution.

40092,2,"X-ray spectral studies of TeV γ-ray emitting blazars This work is a summary of the X-ray spectral studies of 29 TeV (10^12 eV, tera-electron-volt) γ-ray emitting blazars observed with Swift/XRT, especially focusing on sources for which the X-ray regime allows us to study the low- and the high-energy ends of the particle distribution function. Variability studies require simultaneous coverage, ideally sampling different flux states of each source. This is achieved using X-ray observations by disentangling the high-energy end of the synchrotron emission and the low-energy end of the Compton emission, which are produced by the same electron population. We focused on a sample of 29 TeV γ-ray emitting blazars with the best signal-to-noise X-ray observations collected with Swift/XRT in the energy range 0.3–10 keV during 10 yr of Swift/XRT operations. We investigate the X-ray spectral shapes and the effects of different corrections for neutral hydrogen absorption and decompose the synchrotron and inverse Compton components. For five sources (3C 66A, S5 0716+714, W Comae, 4C +21.35 and BL Lacertae) a superposition of both components is observed in the X-ray band, permitting simultaneous, time-resolved studies of both ends of the electron distribution. The analysis of multi-epoch observations revealed that the break energy of the X-ray spectrum varies only by a small factor with flux changes. Flux variability is more pronounced in the synchrotron domain (high-energy end of the electron distribution) than in the Compton domain (low-energy end of the electron distribution). The spectral shape of the Compton domain is stable, while the flux of the synchrotron domain is variable. These changes cannot be described by simple variations of the cut-off energy, suggesting that the high-energy end of the electron distribution is not generally well described by cooling only.",1
40132,2,"Cusps in the center of galaxies: a real conflict with observations or a numerical artefact of cosmological simulations? Galaxy observations and N-body cosmological simulations produce conflicting dark matter halo density profiles for galaxy central regions. While simulations suggest a cuspy and universal density profile (UDP) of this region, the majority of observations favor variable profiles with a core in the center. In this paper, we investigate the convergency of standard N-body simulations, especially in the cusp region, following the approach proposed by [1]. We simulate the well known Hernquist model using the SPH code Gadget-3 and consider the full array of dynamical parameters of the particles. We find that, although the cuspy profile is stable, all integrals of motion characterizing individual particles suffer strong unphysical variations along the whole halo, revealing an effective interaction between the test bodies. This result casts doubts on the reliability of the velocity distribution function obtained in the simulations. Moreover, we find unphysical Fokker-Planck streams of particles in the cusp region. The same streams should appear in cosmological N-body simulations, being strong enough to change the shape of the cusp or even to create it. Our analysis, based on the Hernquist model and the standard SPH code, strongly suggests that the UDPs generally found by the cosmological N-body simulations may be a consequence of numerical effects. A much better understanding of the N-body simulation convergency is necessary before a `core-cusp problem' can properly be used to question the validity of the CDM model.",1

This computation is then performed for two non-toric examples (the figure-eight and three-twist knots).

Finally we discuss the application of our results for the explanation of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by magnetars.",1

We also obtain time-dependent nonequilibrium correlation functions for five particles following quenches of the interaction strength from two distinct initial states. One quench is from the noninteracting ground state and the other from a correlated ground state near the strongly interacting Tonks–Girardeau regime.

40584,2,"The effect of core-collapse supernova accretion phase turbulence on neutrino flavor evolution During the accretion phase of a core-collapse supernovae, large amplitude turbulence is generated by the combination of the standing accretion shock instability and convection driven by neutrino heating. The turbulence directly affects the dynamics of the explosion, but there is also the possibility of an additional, indirect, feedback mechanism due to the effect turbulence can have upon neutrino flavor evolution and thus the neutrino heating. In this paper we consider the effect of turbulence during the accretion phase upon neutrino evolution, both numerically and analytically. Adopting representative supernova profiles taken from the accretion phase of a supernova simulation, we find the numerical calculations exhibit no effect from turbulence. We explain this absence using two analytic descriptions: the stimulated transition model and the distorted phase effect model. In the stimulated transition model turbulence effects depend upon six different lengthscales, and three criteria must be satisfied between them if one is to observe a change in the flavor evolution due to stimulated transition. We further demonstrate that the distorted phase effect depends upon the presence of multiple semi-adiabatic MSW resonances or discontinuities that also can be expressed as a relationship between three of the same lengthscales. When we examine the supernova profiles used in the numerical calculations we find the three stimulated transition criteria cannot be satisfied, independent of the form of the turbulence power spectrum, and that the same supernova profiles lack the multiple semi-adiabatic MSW resonances or discontinuities necessary to produce a distorted phase effect. Thus, we conclude that even though large amplitude turbulence is present in supernova during the accretion phase, it has no effect upon neutrino flavor evolution.",1

Among other limitations, cavity gradients are restricted by occasional sparking inside the cavity, or RF breakdown. It has been shown that presence of external static magnetic field aggravates the influence of breakdown on performance of the cavity. This problem can arise in designs of muon ionization cooling channel, RF guns, klystrons and other applications. The MTA area at Fermilab is the facility that allows us to study the effects of static magnetic fields up to several Tesla on RF cavity operation. As a part of this research program, we have tested ""modular"" cavity in strong external magnetic fields. The special design of the cavity allowed for easier inspection of the cavity, swapping end- plates with different materials and hence better control over sources of systematic errors. Results of high-power tests of “modular” cavity with and without external multi-Tesla magnetic field will be presented.",1
40908,2,"Modeling magnetic neutron stars: a short overview Neutron stars are the endpoint of the life of intermediate mass stars and posses in their cores matter in the most extreme conditions in the universe. Besides their extremes of temperature (found in proto-neutron stars) and densities, typical neutron star' magnetic fields can easily reach trillions of times higher the one of the Sun. Among these stars, about $10\%$ are denominated \emph{magnetars} which possess even stronger surface magnetic fields of up to $10^{15}-10^{16}\,\mathrm{G}$. In this conference proceeding, we present a short review of the history and current literature regarding the modeling of magnetic neutron stars. Our goal is to present the results regarding the introduction of magnetic fields in the equation of state of matter using Relativistic Mean Field models (RMF models) and in the solution of Einstein's equations coupled to the Maxwell's equations in order to generate a consistent calculation of magnetic stars structure. We discuss how equation of state modeling affects mass, radius, deformation, composition and magnetic field distribution in stars and also what are the open questions in this field of research.",1
41058,2,"Scalar boson decays to tau leptons : in the standard model and beyond This thesis presents a study of the scalar sector in the standard model (SM), as well as
different searches for an extended scalar sector in theories beyond the standard model
(BSM). All analyses have in common the fact that at least one scalar boson decays to a
pair of tau leptons. The results exploit the data collected by the CMS detector during
LHC Run-1, in proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 7 or 8 TeV.
The particle discovered in 2012, H, looks compatible with a SM Brout-Englert-Higgs
boson, but this statement is driven by the H → γγ and H → ZZ decay modes. The
H → τ
+τ
− decay mode is the most sensitive fermionic decay channel, and allows to test
the Yukawa couplings of the new particle. The search for the SM scalar boson decaying to
tau leptons, and produced in association with a massive vector boson W or Z, is described
in this thesis. Even though a good background rejection can be achieved by selecting the
leptons originating from the vector boson, Run-1 data are not sensitive to the small production
cross sections predicted in the SM for the scalar boson. The combination with
the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production searches leads to an evidence
for the decay of the H boson to tau leptons.
Many BSM models, such as the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) or models with
two scalar doublets (2HDM), predict the existence of several scalar bosons. The decays
of these bosons to tau leptons can be enhanced in some scenarios depending on the model
parameters, which makes the di-tau decay mode powerful to discover BSM physics. Four
searches for an extended scalar sector are detailed in this thesis. The first analysis searches
for a pseudoscalar boson with a mass between 220 and 350 GeV, decaying to an SM-like
scalar boson and a Z boson, in the final state with two light leptons and two tau leptons.
Second, a search for the exotic decay of the new particle H to a pair of light pseudoscalar
bosons, which is still allowed by all measurements made up to now, in the final state with
two muons and two tau leptons is performed. Third, a mass region almost never explored
at the LHC is probed by the search of a light pseudoscalar, with a mass between 25 and
80 GeV, decaying to tau leptons and produced in association with b quarks. The last
analysis describes the search for a heavy resonance in the MSSM, decaying to a pair of
tau leptons. None of these analyses has found any hint of new physics beyond the SM,
but stringent limits on the cross section of such signals could be set.",1
41083,2,"Calculation of the Geometric Factor in a New Experiment Aimed at Studying Radiative Neutron Decay A new experiment aimed at studying radiative neutron decay is proposed. The respective experimental procedure reduces to measuring the time spectra of triple coincidences of the emitted photon, beta electron, and recoil proton along with the spectrum of double coincidences of ordinary decay products. By means of this procedure, we were able to measure for the first time the branching ratio for radiative neutron decay, BR = (3.2 ± 1.6) × 10$^{−3}$ (at a confidence level of C.L. = 99.7%, the photon energy being in excess of 35 keV) in 2005 at our old setup. The average value of this branching ratio was greater by a factor of 1.5 than its theoretical counterpart calculated on the basis of the Standard Model. However, we cannot state that we have seen a deviation fromthe StandardModel prediction since the experimental error was quite large in that experiment. The present study is devoted to implementing, by means of the popular Geant4 code package, a computer analog of the respective experiment at a new facility. Our calculations reveal that the resulting geometri©factor values make it possible to a accumulate, in a live experiment, a data sample sufficient for measuring the above branching ratio to a precision of a few percent.",1
41112,2,"Splitting of electrons and violation of the Luttinger sum rule We obtain a controlled description of a strongly correlated regime of electronic behavior. We begin by arguing that there are two ways to characterize the electronic degree of freedom, either by the canonical fermion algebra or the graded Lie algebra su(2|2). The first underlies the Fermi liquid description of correlated matter, and we identify a regime governed by the latter. We exploit an exceptional central extension of su(2|2) to employ a perturbative scheme recently developed by Shastry and obtain a series of successive approximations for the electronic Green's function. We then focus on the leading approximation, which reveals a splitting in two of the electronic dispersion. The Luttinger sum rule is violated, and a Mott metal-insulator transition is exhibited. We offer a perspective.",1
41201,2,"A note on the relations between thermodynamics, energy definitions and Friedmann equations We investigate the relation between the Friedmann and thermodynamic pressure equations, through solving the Friedmann and thermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously. Our investigation shows that a perfect fluid, as a suitable solution for the Friedmann equations leading to the standard modeling of the universe expansion history, cannot simultaneously satisfy the thermodynamic pressure equation and those of Friedmann. Moreover, we consider various energy definitions, such as the Komar mass, and solve the Friedmann and thermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously to get some models for dark energy fluids. The cosmological consequences of obtained solutions are also addressed. Our results indicate that some of obtained solutions may unify the dominated fluid in both the primary inflationary and current accelerating eras into one model. In addition, by taking into account a cosmic fluid of a known equation of state (EoS), and combining it with the Friedmann and thermodynamic pressure equations, we obtain the corresponding energy of these cosmic fluids and face their limitations. Finally, we point out the cosmological features of this cosmic fluid and also study its observational constraints.",1
41217,2,Cosmological results from the Kilo Degree Survey Gravitational lensing represents a unique tool to study the dark Universe. In the weak lensing regime small distortions in the images of galaxies caused by the large-scale structure can be detected over the whole sky. Measuring these coherent distortions yields cosmological insights complementary to other probes like the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Ongoing wide-field imaging surveys exploit this to come up with competitive constraints on important cosmological parameters. Here we concentrate on recent results from the ongoing European Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) that show a mild tension with CMB measurements from the Planck mission when the standard cosmological model is assumed. Possible solutions to this discrepancy using extensions to the standard model of cosmology and future developments are discussed.,1
41230,2,"Electro-mechanical Casimir effect The dynamical Casimir effect is an intriguing phenomenon in which photons are generated from vacuum due to a non-adiabatic change in some boundary conditions. In particular, it connects the motion of an accelerated mechanical mirror to the generation of photons. While pioneering experiments demonstrating this effect exist, a conclusive measurement involving a mechanical resonator is still missing. We show that a hybrid system consisting of a piezoelectric mechanical resonator coupled to a superconducting cavity may allow to electro-mechanically generate measurable photons from vacuum, intrinsically associated to the dynamical Casimir effect. Such an experiment may be achieved with current technology, based on film bulk acoustic resonators directly coupled to a superconducting cavity. Our results predict a measurable photon generation, which can be further increased through additional improvements such as using superconducting metamaterials.",1
41258,2,"Regulator Artifacts in Uniform Matter for Chiral Interactions Regulator functions applied to two- and three-nucleon forces are a necessary ingredient in many-body calculations based on chiral effective field theory interactions. These interactions have been developed recently with a variety of different cutoff forms, including regulating both the momentum transfer (local) and the relative momentum (nonlocal). While in principle any regulator that suppresses high-momentum modes can be employed, in practice artifacts are inevitable in current power counting schemes. Artifacts from particular regulators may cause significant distortions of the physics or may affect many-body convergence rates, so understanding their nature is important. Here we characterize the differences between cutoff effects using uniform matter at Hartree–Fock and second order in the interaction as a test-bed. This provides a clean laboratory to isolate phase-space effects of various regulators on both two- and three-nucleon interactions. We test the normal-ordering approximation for three-nucleon forces in nuclear matter and find that the relative size of the residual 3N contributions is sensitive to the employed regularization scheme.",1

41438,2,"Measurement of the PPN parameter $\gamma $ by testing the geometry of near-Earth space The Beyond Einstein Advanced Coherent Optical Network (BEACON) mission was designed to achieve an accuracy of $10^{-9}$ in measuring the Eddington parameter $\gamma $ , which is perhaps the most fundamental Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameter. However, this ideal accuracy was just estimated as a ratio of the measurement accuracy of the inter-spacecraft distances to the magnitude of the departure from Euclidean geometry. Based on the BEACON concept, we construct a measurement model to estimate the parameter $\gamma $ with the least squares method. Influences of the measurement noise and the out-of-plane error on the estimation accuracy are evaluated based on the white noise model. Though the BEACON mission does not require expensive drag-free systems and avoids physical dynamical models of spacecraft, the relatively low accuracy of initial inter-spacecraft distances poses a great challenge, which reduces the estimation accuracy in about two orders of magnitude. Thus the noise requirements may need to be more stringent in the design in order to achieve the target accuracy, which is demonstrated in the work. Considering that, we have given the limits on the power spectral density of both noise sources for the accuracy of $10^{-9}$ .",1
41451,2,"Use of Topology in physical problems Some of the basic concepts of topology are explored through known physics problems. This helps us in two ways, one, in motivating the definitions and the concepts, and two, in showing that topological analysis leads to a clearer understanding of the problem. The problems discussed are taken from classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, solid state physics, and biology (DNA), to emphasize some unity in diverse areas of physics. It is the real Euclidean space, $R^d$, with which we are most familiar. Intuitions can therefore be sharpened by appealing to the relevant features of this known space, and by using these as simplest examples to illustrate the abstract topological concepts. This is what is done in this chapter.",1
41483,2,"Silicon photomultiplier readout of a monolithic 270$\times$5$\times$5 cm$^3$ plastic scintillator bar for time of flight applications The detection of 200–1000 MeV neutrons requires large amounts, ~100cm , of detector material because of the long nuclear interaction length of these particles. In the example of the NeuLAND neutron time-of-flight detector at FAIR, this is accomplished by using 3000 monolithic scintillator bars of 270×5×5cm3 size made of a fast plastic. Each bar is read out on the two long ends, and the needed time resolution of σt<150ps is reached with fast timing photomultipliers. In the present work, it is investigated whether silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) photosensors can be used instead. Experiments with a picosecond laser system were conducted to determine the timing response of the assembly made up of SiPM and preamplifier. The response of the full system including also the scintillator was studied using 30 MeV single electrons provided by the ELBE superconducting electron linac. The ELBE data were matched by a simple Monte Carlo simulation, and they were found to obey an inverse-square-root scaling law. In the electron beam tests, a time resolution of σt=136ps was reached with a pure SiPM readout, well within the design parameters for NeuLAND.",1
41484,2,New charged anisotropic compact models We find new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations which are relevant in the description of highly compact stellar objects. The relativistic star is charged and anisotropic with a quark equation of state. Exact solutions of the field equations are found in terms of elementary functions. It is interesting to note that we regain earlier quark models with uncharged and charged matter distributions. A physical analysis indicates that the matter distributions are well behaved and regular throughout the stellar structure. A range of stellar masses are generated for particular parameter values in the electric field. In particular the observed mass for a binary pulsar is regained.,1

We argue that this model works as a dark fluid model which can interpolate between dust equation of state and the dark energy equation of state. We show how the asymptotic behavior of the equation of state constrained the parameters of the model. The causality condition for the model is also studied to constrain the parameters and the fixed points are tested to determine different solution classes. Observations of Hubble diagram of SNe Ia supernovae are used to further constrain the model. We present an exact solution of the model and calculate the luminosity distance and the energy density evolution. We also calculate the deceleration parameter to test the state of the universe expansion.",1
41617,2,"A High Precision Pulse Generation and Stabilization System for Bolometric Experiments Bolometric experiments searching for rare events usually require an extremely low radioactive background to prevent spurious signals from mimicking those of interest, spoiling the sensitivity of the apparatus. In such contexts, radioactive sources cannot be used to produce a known signal to calibrate the measured energy spectrum during data taking. In this paper we present an instrument designed to generate ultra-stable and very precise calibrating pulses, which can be used to stabilize the response of bolometers during data taking. The instrument is characterized by the presence of multi-outputs, a completely programmable pulse width and amplitude and a dedicated daisy-chained optical trigger line. It can be fully controlled and monitored remotely via CAN bus protocol. An energy resolution of the order of 20 eV FWHM at 1 MeV (2 eV FWHM at 10 keV) and a thermal stability of the order of 0.1 ppm/oC have been achieved. The device can also provide an adjustable power to compensate the low frequency thermal fluctuations that typically occur in cryogenic experiments.",1

In particular, a general solution is obtained which is further used to reconstruct some important solutions in cosmological contexts. The physical quantities like energy density, pressure, and equation of state parameter are calculated. A Starobinsky-like model is proposed which is used to analyze the behavior of universe for different values of equation of state parameter.

We investigate the possibility of measuring the total neutrino mass through the suppression of power in the matter power spectrum. We investigate the possibility of measuring the neutrino mass through its imprint on the cross-correlation power spectrum of the 21 cm signal and the Lyman α forest. We consider a radio-interferometric measurement of the 21 cm signal with a SKA1-mid-like radio telescope and a BOSS-like Lyman α forest survey. A Fisher matrix analysis shows that at the fiducial redshift z = 2.5, a 10 000 h 21 cm observation distributed equally over 25 radio pointings and a Lyman α forest survey with 30 quasars lines of sights in 1deg^2, allows us to measure Ω_ν at a 3.25 per cent level.

41804,2,"Wave equations in conformal gravity We study the wave equation governing massless fields of all spins (s = 0, 1 2, 1, 3 2 and 2) in the most general spherical symmetric metric of conformal gravity. The equation is separable, the solution of the angular part is a spin-weighted spherical harmonic, and the radial wave function may be expressed in terms of solutions of the Heun equation which has four regular singular points. We also consider various special cases of the metric and find that the angular wave functions are the same for all cases, the actual shape of the metric functions affects only the radial wave function. It is interesting to note that each radial equation can be transformed into a known ordinary differential equation (i.e. Heun equation, or confluent Heun equation, or hypergeometric equation). The results show that there are analytic solutions for all the wave equations of massless spin fields in the spacetimes of conformal gravity. This is amazing because exact solutions are few and far between for other spacetimes.",1
41872,2,"Numerical Simulations of Collimation Efficiency for Beam Collimation System in the Fermilab Booster A two-stage beam collimation (2SC) system has been installed in the Fermilab Booster more than 10 years ago. It consists of two primary collimators (horizontal and vertical) and three 1.2m-long secondary collimators. The two-stage collimation has never been used in Booster operations due to uncontrolled beam orbit variations produced by radial cogging (it is required for beam accumulation in Recycler). Instead, only secondary collimators were used in the single-stage collimation (1SC). Recently introduced magnetic cogging resulted in orbit stabilization in the course of almost entire accelerating cycle and created a possibility for the 2SC. In this paper, the 2SC performance is evaluated and compared the 1SC. Several parameters characterizing collimation efficiency are calculated in order to compare both schemes. A combination of the MADX and MARS15 codes is used for proton tracking in the Booster with their scattering in collimators being accounted. The dependence of efficiency on the primary collimators foil thickness is presented. The efficiency dependence on the proton energy is also obtained for the optimal foil. The feasibility of the 2SC scheme for the Booster is discussed.",1

41997,2,"Radiation reaction on a Brownian scalar electron in high-intensity fields Radiation reaction against a relativistic electron is of critical importance since the experiment to check this ""quantumness"" becomes possible soon with an extremely high-intensity laser beam. However, there is a fundamental mathematical quest to apply any laser profiles to laser focusing and superposition beyond the Furry picture of its usual method by a plane wave. To give the apparent meaning of $q(\chi)$ the quantumness factor with respect to a radiation process is absent. Thus for resolving the above questions, we propose stochastic quantization of the classical radiation reaction model for any laser field profiles, via the construction of the relativistic Brownian kinematics with the dynamics of a scalar electron and the Maxwell equation with a current by a Brownian quanta. This is the first proposal of the coupling system between a relativistic Brownian quanta and fields in Nelson's stochastic quantization. Therefore, we can derive the radiation field by its Maxwell equation, too. This provides us the fact that $q(\chi)$ produced by QED is regarded as $\mathscr{P}(\varOmega_{\tau}^{\mathrm{ave}})$ of an existence probability such that a scalar electron stay on its average trajectory.",1
42019,2,"Relativistic vortex electrons: paraxial versus non-paraxial regimes A plane-wave approximation in particle physics implies that a width of a massive wave packet $\sigma_{\perp}$ is much larger than its Compton wavelength $\lambda_c = \hbar/mc$. For Gaussian beams or for the packets with the non-singular phases (say, the Airy beams), corrections to this approximation are generally attenuated as $\lambda_c^2/\sigma_{\perp}^2 \ll 1$, which amounts to less than $10^{-14}$ for modern electron accelerators and less than $10^{-6}$ for electron microscopes. Here we show that this situation drastically changes for particles with the phase vortices associated with an orbital angular momentum $\ell\hbar$ because the non-paraxial corrections get $|\ell|$ times enhanced. For available vortex electron beams, $|\ell|$ can be as high as $10^3$, which allows one to go beyond the conventional paraxial regime in particle scattering. We describe the corresponding relativistic wave packets, both for vortex bosons and fermions, which transform correctly under the Lorentz boosts and are localized in a 3D space. By calculating the observables like mean energy, magnetic moment, and so forth, we demonstrate that the non-paraxial corrections can reach the relative values of $10^{-3}$, yield a proportional increase of an invariant mass of the electron wave packet, describe a spin-orbit coupling as well as the quantum coherence phenomena in particle and atomic collisions.",1
42128,2,"Universality in volume-law entanglement of scrambled pure quantum states A pure quantum state can fully describe thermal equilibrium as long as one focuses on local observables. The thermodynamic entropy can also be recovered as the entanglement entropy of small subsystems. When the size of the subsystem increases, however, quantum correlations break the correspondence and mandate a correction to this simple volume law. The elucidation of the size dependence of the entanglement entropy is thus essentially important in linking quantum physics with thermodynamics. Here we derive an analytic formula of the entanglement entropy for a class of pure states called cTPQ states representing equilibrium. We numerically find that our formula applies universally to any sufficiently scrambled pure state representing thermal equilibrium, i.e., energy eigenstates of non-integrable models and states after quantum quenches. Our formula is exploited as diagnostics for chaotic systems, it can distinguish integrable models from non-integrable models and many-body localization phases from chaotic phases.",1

In the flat space described with the complex octonions, the radius vector is combined with the integrating function of field potential to become a composite radius vector. And the latter can be considered as the radius vector in a flat composite-space (a function space). Further it is able to deduce some formulae between the physical quantity and spatial parameter, in the complex-octonion curved composite-space. Under the condition of weak field approximation, these formulae infer a few results accordant with the general theory of relativity. The study reveals that it is capable of ascertaining which physical quantities are able to result in the warping of space, in terms of the curved composite-space described with the complex octonions. Moreover, the method may be expanded into some curved function spaces, seeking out more possible physical quantities to impact the bending degree of curved spaces.",1

42419,2,"Testing Einstein’s gravity and dark energy with growth of matter perturbations: Indications for new physics? The growth index of matter fluctuations is computed for ten distinct accelerating cosmological models and confronted by the latest growth-rate data via a two-step process. First, we implement a joint statistical analysis in order to place constraints on the free parameters of all models using solely background data. Second, using the observed growth rate of clustering from various galaxy surveys we test the performance of the current cosmological models at the perturbation level while either marginalizing over σ8 or having it as a free parameter. As a result, we find that at a statistical level, i.e., after considering the best-fit χ2 or the value of the Akaike information criterion, most models are in very good agreement with the growth-rate data and are practically indistinguishable from ΛCDM. However, when we also consider the internal consistency of the models by comparing the theoretically predicted values of (γ0,γ1), i.e., the value of the growth index γ(z) and its derivative today, with the best-fit ones, we find that the predictions of three out of ten dark energy models are in mild tension with the best-fit ones when σ8 is marginalized over. When σ8 is free we find that most models are not only in mild tension, but also predict low values for σ8. This could be attributed to either a systematic problem with the growth-rate data or the emergence of new physics at low redshifts, with the latter possibly being related to the well-known issue of the lack of power at small scales. Finally, by utilizing mock data based on an large synoptic survey telescope-like survey we show that with future surveys and by using the growth index parametrization, it will be possible to resolve the issue of the low σ8 but also the tension between the fitted and theoretically predicted values of (γ0,γ1).",1

42439,2,"21 cm Angular Power Spectrum from Minihalos as a Probe of Primordial Spectral Runnings Measurements of 21 cm line fluctuations from minihalos have been discussed as a powerful probe of a wide range of cosmological models. However, previous studies have taken into account only the pixel variance, where contributions from different scales are integrated. In order to sort out information from different scales, we formulate the angular power spectrum of 21 cm line fluctuations from minihalos at different redshifts, which can enhance the constraining power enormously. By adopting this formalism, we investigate expected constraints on parameters characterizing the primordial power spectrum, particularly focusing on the spectral index ns and its runnings αs and βs. We show that future observations of 21 cm line fluctuations from minihalos, in combination with cosmic microwave background, can potentially probe these runnings as αs ~ (10−3) and βs ~ (10−4). Its implications to the test of inflationary models are also discussed.",1
42533,2,"Interacting Weyl fermions: Phases, phase transitions and global phase diagram We study the effects of short-range interactions on a generalized three-dimensional Weyl semimetal, where the band touching points act as the (anti)monopoles of Abelian Berry curvature of strength n. We show that any local interaction has a negative scaling dimension −2/n. Consequently, all Weyl semimetals are stable against weak short-range interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, we demonstrate that the Weyl semimetal either undergoes a first-order transition into a band insulator or a continuous transition into a symmetry breaking phase. A translational symmetry breaking axion insulator and a rotational symmetry breaking semimetal are two prominent candidates for the broken symmetry phase. At the one-loop order, the correlation length exponent for continuous transitions is ν=n/2, indicating their non-Gaussian nature for any n>1. We also discuss the scaling of the thermodynamic and transport quantities in general Weyl semimetals as well as inside broken symmetry phases.",1
42539,2,"Phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider The search for physics Beyond the Standard Model is the underlying motivation for
the physics programme of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In this thesis we
will present studies into the Large Hadron Collider phenomenology of dark matter
inspired extensions to the Standard Model, di-Higgs + 2 jet (hhjj) production, CP
violating effects in the Higgs sector, and the use of shape information from top
polarisation measurements in searches for new physics.
Full scans of the parameter space of Simplified Dark Matter models are demonstrated
to be viable and allow for intriguing comparisons to relic density constraints.
Strongly self-interacting dark sectors are shown to leave a potentially measurable
imprint on the energy scaling of mediator production. The weak boson fusion induced
production of hhjj turns out to be sensitive to a number of new physics
effects, including CP violation in the Higgs sector. The use of top polarisation measurements
to discover new physics which predicts polarised resonances is shown to
be an effective way to ameliorate the loss of shape information for kinematically
challenging regions of parameter space.",1
42596,2,"Approach to combined-function magnets via symplectic slicing In this article we describe how to obtain symplectic “slice” maps for combined-function magnets, by using a method of generating functions. A feature of this method is that one can use an unexpanded and unsplit Hamiltonian. From such a slice map we obtain a first-order map which is symplectic at the closed orbit. We also obtain a symplectic kick map. Both results were implemented into the widely used program MAD-X to regain, in particular, the twiss parameters for the sliced model of the Proton Synchrotron at CERN. In addition, we obtain recursion equations for symplectic maps of general time-dependent Hamiltonians, which might be useful even beyond the scope of accelerator physics.",1
42639,2,"Quantum Decimation in Hilbert Space: Coarse-Graining without Structure We present a technique to coarse grain quantum states in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Our method is distinguished from other approaches by not relying on structures such as a preferred factorization of Hilbert space or a preferred set of operators (local or otherwise) in an associated algebra. Rather, we use the data corresponding to a given set of states, either specified independently or constructed from a single state evolving in time. Our technique is based on principle component analysis (PCA), and the resulting coarse-grained quantum states live in a lower-dimensional Hilbert space whose basis is defined using the underlying (isometric embedding) transformation of the set of fine-grained states we wish to coarse grain. Physically, the transformation can be interpreted to be an “entanglement coarse-graining” scheme that retains most of the global, useful entanglement structure of each state, while needing fewer degrees of freedom for its reconstruction. This scheme could be useful for efficiently describing collections of states whose number is much smaller than the dimension of Hilbert space, or a single state evolving over time.",1

partonic cross sections in a form that makes their SU(2) × U (1) and custodial

especially promising in the near term, due to large rates and to exceptional

Furthermore, we analyze two well-known differential equations (which occupy principal importance in the exploration of causes of energy density inhomogeneities) with the help of the Weyl tensor and the conservation laws. The irregularity factors for a spherical star are examined for particular cases of dust and isotropic and anisotropic fluids in dissipative and nondissipative regimes in the framework of f(R,T) gravity.

43028,2,"Cosmology with Type Ia supernovæ: environmental effects We measure host galaxy photometry and local fluxes within 3 kpc for 882 Type Ia supernovæ (SNIa) spanning the redshift range 0.01 < z < 1 and use SED fitting techniques to derive host properties such as stellar masses and local U −V rest-frame colors. The latter is an indicator of the luminosity weighted age of the stellar population in a galaxy. We find that local U −V color brightness dependence is at least as significant as it is for properties of the host galaxy as a whole (host stellar mass or global U −V rest-frame color). Once selection requirements are chosen, we perform cosmological fits using local color as a third standardization variable and find its step significance at the level of 7σ, indicating that the remaining luminosity variations in SNIa samples can be reduced using a third standardization variable taking the local environment into account. Even after a mass step correction, a correlation of 4.6σ is found between local U −V color and Hubble diagram residuals. We find that using the local color in place of the stellar mass results in a change in the measured value of the dark energy equation of state parameter of 0.6%. The precise analysis of local environment of SNIa will be of great importance for the forthcoming surveys, and in particular LSST for which uncertainties on the dark energy equation of state will be comparable to the reported effects [1].",1

43031,2,"Cross Section Measurement of a Standard Model Higgs Boson in the $H \to WW \to l\nu l\nu$ Decay Channel with the ATLAS Experiment The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes the elementary particles
and their interactions and has been tested to the utmost precision. The discovery of
the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012 marks the detection of the last
remaining unobserved phenomenon. Thus, it confirms the mechanism of spontaneous
electroweak symmetry breaking which represents the origin of the mass of elementary
particles.
The presented thesis examines the properties of a Standard Model Higgs boson in the
decay channel H → WW → `ν`ν with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron

s = 8 TeV
and includes the complete 2012 dataset with an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb−1

investigations focus on the dominant gluon fusion production process.
On the basis of the particular signature of the Higgs boson decay, a general analysis
strategy is developed to separate the signal from the background processes. The channel
is characterized by two isolated leptons and large missing transverse momentum. With
a dedicated event selection the significance of the measurement is successively increased.
The accurate determination of the background processes is of essential importance and

43049,2,"Evolution of mass and velocity filed in comic web: comparison between baryonic and dark matter We investigate the evolution of the cosmic web since z = 5 in grid-based cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, focusing on the mass and velocity fields of both baryonic and cold dark matter. The tidal tensor of density is used as the main method for web identification, with λ (th) = 0.2–1.2. The evolution trends in baryonic and dark matter are similar, although moderate differences are observed. Sheets appear early, and their large-scale pattern may have been set up by z = 3. In terms of mass, filaments supersede sheets as the primary collapsing structures from z ∼ 2–3. Tenuous filaments assembled with each other to form prominent ones at z <  2. In accordance with the construction of the frame of the sheets, the cosmic divergence velocity, v (div), was already well-developed above 2–3 Mpc by z = 3. Afterwards, the curl velocity, v (curl), grew dramatically along with the rising of filaments, becoming comparable to v (div), for <2–3 Mpc at z = 0. The scaling of v (curl) can be described by the hierarchical turbulence model. The alignment between the vorticity and the eigenvectors of the shear tensor in the baryonic matter field resembles that in the dark matter field, and is even moderately stronger between ${\boldsymbol{\omega }}$ and ${{\boldsymbol{e}}}_{1}$, and ω and ${{\boldsymbol{e}}}_{3}$. Compared with dark matter, there is slightly less baryonic matter found residing in filaments and clusters, and its vorticity developed more significantly below 2–3 Mpc. These differences may be underestimated because of the limited resolution and lack of star formation in our simulation. The impact of the change of dominant structures in overdense regions at z ∼ 2–3 on galaxy formation and evolution is shortly discussed.",1

Furthermore, a design method was proposed that involves the FE results and a vacuum sealing model. Finally, leak rate measurements were carried out to assess the sealing performance of selected coupling configurations. The main result found was that the leak rate constraints for UHV applications could be easily satisfied (leak rate <10−10 mbar l s−1), which opens the possibility of remotely clamping/unclamping the tight couplers by well-defined changes in their temperature. Possible applications in the field of particle accelerators and, in particular, in restricted access areas were considered.",1

From the form factors, the point-charge and point-matter radii, inter-neutron distances, and neutron opening angles are extracted. Agreement is found with existing experimental extractions. Results are given for the point-charge and point-matter radii for arbitrary neutron core scattering effective range ρcn, which can be used for predictions once ρcn is measured. Estimates for ρcn are also used to make NLO predictions. Finally, the point-charge radii of this work are compared with other halo-EFT predictions, and setting the core mass equal to the neutron mass the point-charge radius is found to agree with an analytical prediction in the unitary limit.",1

43277,2,"Calculs théoriques de corrections nucléaires aux taux de transitions β super-permises pour les tests du Modèle Standard The conservation of the weak vector current, known as CVC is one of the fundamental
hypothesis of the Standard Model of the electroweak interaction. Nevertheless,
the physics background of this hypothesis is nothing more than an analogy
to the electromagnetic interaction’s theory and the question of its validity remains
open. The CVC is verifiable in the superallowed Fermi β-decays, 0+ → 0
+, T = 1
since it predicts that the Ft (≡ corrected f t) value of such low-energy processes
must be nucleus independent. Once the unique Ft value is found, one can immediately
deduce the vector coupling constant GV , linked to |Vud|, the norm of the
most important element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing
matrix. This matrix element plays a crucial role in the test of the unitarity of the
CKM matrix, another fundamental hypothesis of the Standard Model.
Currently, 14 superallowed transitions ranging from 10C to 74Rb are known experimentally
with the precision 0.1% or better. This results in a fact that this study
is now limited by the theoretical corrections, due to the radiative and the isospinsymmetry-breaking
effects.
The aim of this thesis is to re-examine the correction due to mismatch between
proton and neutron radial wave functions (δRO) within the framework of shell model.
We adopted the method recently developed by Towner and Hardy [1]. This method
combines realistic radial wave functions with spectroscopic informations obtained
from a large-scale shell-model calculation, thus allowing us to go beyond traditional
shell-model approaches.
In this work, we considered 13 superallowed transitions, including : 22Mg, 26Al,
26Si, 30S, 34Cl, 34Ar, 38K, 38Ca, 46V, 50Mn, 54Co, 62Ga et 66As. The radial wave functions
were determined with a realistic single-particle potential, such as the phenomenological
Woods-Saxon (WS) potential or the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF)
mean field derived from an effective Skyrme force. We selected various parametrizations
(2 param´etrizations for WS and 3 Skyrme forces for HF) that seem to us to
be appropriate for our purposes. First, we performed the calculations with a simple method, without taking into
account the intermediate states. The result indicates that δRO obtained from WS
potential is strongly parametrization dependent. In order to clarify this effect, we
studied profoundly the sensitivity to potential parameters, paying particular attention
to the isovector and the Coulomb terms. This study provided evidence that
such a dependence is entirely dominated by the isovector part of the potential. However,
using our proposed adjustment procedure, this problem appears to be well
under control. We also examined the surface terms adopted in the work of Towner
and Hardy [1], the result showed that one of these terms (the term Vh(r)) is not compatible with our adjustment procedure.
Concerning the calculations with the self-consistent HF mean field, the dependence
on parametrization (of the Skyrme force) is not so strong as in the case with
WS, except for 30S where δRO is particularly dominated by the 2s1/2 state. To examine
the non-local exchange terms, calculations with Gogny force have been realized.
The results of these calculations justify the sufficient of the Slater approximation
for treating the Coulomb exchange term and of the center of mass correction while
neglecting 2-body term.
Then, we calculated the radial overlap correction in a more rigorous approach,
where the overlap integrals are evaluated with low-energy spectra of the intermediate
nucleus. The results obtained from these calculations are generally in good agreement
with the previous calculations, except for 62Ga and 66As. For these 2 cases, we
have selected a bigger model space and used a more recent effective interaction, compared
to those of the previous works. We also observed that WS potential resulted
systematically the values for δRO larger than those obtained from Skyrme-HF.
The correction for isospin mixing inside the model space (δIM ) has been reexamined.
The calculations were realized with the existing charge dependent interactions
and with a new interaction produced by our group. The deficiency of the
isoscalar part of the hamiltonian was compensated with a scaling factor, within
the assumption that two-level mixing model is validated. The results are extremely
interaction dependent and are not in agreement with the previous calculations.
At last, the implication for the Standard Model has been done. From the result,
the calculation of Towner and Hardy in 2015 [2] provides an excellent agreement with
the two hypothesis of the Standard Model, indicating that core-polarization effects
should be taken into account. By contrast the results obtained with Skyrme-HF are
in poor agreement with the Standard Model.",1

We implement a principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate the uncertainties in the reionization history from a joint quasar-CMB dataset. A thorough Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis is done over the parameter space of PCA modes for both non-flat $\Lambda$CDM inflation models as well as the original Planck 2016 tilted, spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM inflation model. Although both flat and non-flat models can closely match the low-redshift ($z\lesssim6$) observations, we notice a possible tension between high-redshift ($z\sim8$) Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter data and the non-flat models. This is solely due to the fact that the closed models have a relatively higher reionization optical depth compared to the flat one, which in turn demands more high-redshift ionizing sources and favors an extended reionization starting as early as $z\approx14$. We also indicate the promising prospects of near-future surveys to decisively resolve this issue.",1
43574,2,"Exploration of the Fundaments of Oncogenesis: A Unified Field Approach to Aetiology Oncology, a complex multifactor etiology has eluded all-inclusive prevention and remission by a lack of comprehensive understanding of a singular causation at the most fundamental physical level. Current physiological models address the myriad branches but not the global biophysical root of aetiology. Current thinking claims that underlying quantum field dynamics are the ‘basement of reality’. Einstein emphatically stated comparably to his General Relativity, that ‘it was merely a convenient stopping place on the road to a more unified theory’. We propose that oncogenesis (for the several hundred tabulated cancers) occurs from one single causative factor at the root of the three considered branches of causation. Physical science (which includes chemistry, biochemistry or biophysics) has evolved from 3D Newtonian classical mechanics to the current vogue (albeit experimentally verified) of 4D quantum mechanics. Empirical access to the 3rd regime of unified field mechanics (UFM) with inherent additional degrees of freedom is imminent. In regards to that perspective, it is proposed, that a ‘telergic stressor’ mediated by noetic action of the unified field produces conformal change in protein molecules that can cascade into a system of oncogenic specificity. Although the action of this fundamental stressor appears extracurricular to the current investiture on the ‘branches of causation’: Environmental (radiation, chemical), genetic/epigenetic, or psychosomatic; this paradigm shift is in process as threshold violations of QED (Quantum Electrodynamics) are occurring in more than one arena. The epigenome is involved in regulating gene expression, development, tissue differentiation, and suppression of transposable elements. Unlike the underlying genome which is largely static within an individual, the epigenome can be dynamically altered by external conditions.

The power supply provides rising the magnetic field inside the KEDR main solenoid, long-term stabilization, and lowering the field to zero. The inductance of the solenoid is 1.2 H. The usual operating magnetic field is 0.6 T, which corresponds to the 2.4-kA current in the solenoid winding and 3.46 MJ of stored energy. The power supply pumps the field up to 0.6 T, within 110 h, and can keep it constant for several months. In this paper, the design, parameters, and performance of the superconducting rectifier are discussed.",1
44381,2,"Radiative$^{3}$He( $\alpha , \gamma$ )$^{7}$Be reaction in halo effective field theory In this work we study the radiative capture of$^{3}$He on$^{4}$He within the halo effective field theory (EFT) framework. At leading order the capture amplitude comprises the initial state s-wave strong and Coulomb interactions summed to all orders. At the same order in the expansion, leading two-body currents contribute as well. We find delicate cancelations between the various contributions, and the two-body current contributions can be replaced by appropriately enhancing the asymptotic normalizations of the$^{7}$Be ground and first excited state wave functions. The next-to-leading order corrections come from the s-wave shape parameter and the pure Coulomb d-wave initial state interactions. We fit the EFT parameters to available scattering data and most recent capture data. Our zero-energy astrophysical S-factor estimate, $S_{34}\sim 0.55$ keV b, is consistent within error bars with the average in the literature.",1
44414,2,"Suborbital Fermi/LAT Analysis of the Brightest Gamma-Ray Flare of Blazar 3C 454.3 Recent detection of suborbital gamma-ray variability of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) 3C 279 by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is in severe conflict with established models of blazar emission. This paper presents the results of suborbital analysis of the Fermi/LAT data for the brightest gamma-ray flare of another FSRQ blazar 3C 454.3 in November 2010 (Modified Julian Date; MJD 55516-22). Gamma-ray light curves are calculated for characteristic time bin lengths as short as 3 min. The measured variations of the 0.1–10 GeV photon flux are tested against the hypothesis of steady intraorbit flux. In addition, the structure function is calculated for absolute photon flux differences and for their significances. Significant gamma-ray flux variations are measured only over time scales longer than ∼5 h, which is consistent with the standard blazar models.",1
44434,2,"Pyrame 3, an online framework for Calice SiW-Ecal Pyrame 3 is the new version of the Pyrame framework [1], with emphasize on the online data treatment and the complex tasks scripting. A new mechanism has been implemented to allow any module to treat and publish data in real time. Those data are made available to any requesting module. A circular buffer mechanism allows to break the real-time constraint and to serve the slower programs in a generic subsampling way. On the other side, a programming facility called event-loop has been provided in C/C++ language to ease the development of monitoring programs. On the SiW-Ecal prototype, the acquisition chain launches a bunch of online decoders that makes available raw data plus some basic reconstruction data (true coordinate, true time, data quality tags\ldots). With the event-loop, it is now really very easy to implement new online monitoring programs. On the other side, the scripting mechanism has been enhanced to provide complete control of the detector to the scripts. This way, we are able to script and monitor complex behaviours like position or energy scanning, calibrations or data driven reconfigurations.",1
44447,2,"Double-slit experiment in momentum space Young's classic double-slit experiment demonstrates the reality of interference when waves and particles travel simultaneously along two different spatial paths. Here, we propose a double-slit experiment in momentum space, realized in the free-space elastic scattering of vortex electrons. We show that this process proceeds along two paths in momentum space, which are well localized and well separated from each other. For such vortex beams, the (plane-wave) amplitudes along the two paths acquire adjustable phase shifts and produce interference fringes in the final angular distribution. We argue that this experiment can be realized with the present-day technology. We show that it gives experimental access to the Coulomb phase, a quantity which plays an important role in all charged particle scattering but which usual scattering experiments are insensitive to.",1
44520,2,"Nontrivial critical fixed point for replica-symmetry-breaking transitions The transformation of the free-energy landscape from smooth to hierarchical is one of the richest features of mean-field disordered systems. A well-studied example is the de Almeida–Thouless transition for spin glasses in a magnetic field, and a similar phenomenon—the Gardner transition—has recently been predicted for structural glasses. The existence of these replica-symmetry-breaking phase transitions has, however, long been questioned below their upper critical dimension, du=6. Here, we obtain evidence for the existence of these transitions in d<du using a two-loop calculation. Because the critical fixed point is found in the strong-coupling regime, we corroborate the result by resumming the perturbative series with inputs from a three-loop calculation and an analysis of its large-order behavior. Our study offers a resolution of the long-lasting controversy surrounding phase transitions in finite-dimensional disordered systems.",1
44546,2,"Interaction effects on the classification of crystalline topological insulators and superconductors We classify interacting topological insulators and superconductors with order-two crystal symmetries (reflection or twofold rotation), focusing on the case where interactions reduce the noninteracting classification. We find that the free-fermion Z2 classifications are stable against quartic contact interactions, whereas the Z classifications reduce to ZN, where N depends on the symmetry class and the dimension d. These results are derived using a quantum nonlinear σ model (QNLSM) that describes the effects of the quartic interactions on the boundary modes of the crystalline topological phases. We use Clifford algebra extensions to derive the target spaces of these QNLSMs in a unified way. The reduction pattern of the free-fermion classification then follows from the presence or absence of topological terms in the QNLSMs, which is determined by the homotopy group of the target spaces. We show that this derivation can be performed using either a complex fermion or a real Majorana representation of the crystalline topological phases and demonstrate that these two representations give consistent results. To illustrate the breakdown of the noninteracting classification, we present examples of crystalline topological insulators and superconductors in one, two, and three dimensions whose surface modes are unstable against interactions. For the three-dimensional example, we show that the reduction pattern obtained by the QNLSM method agrees with the one inferred from the stability analysis of the boundary modes using bosonization.",1

44608,2,"Test of Spin and Parity of the Higgs Boson in the 𝐻 → 𝑊 𝑊 ∗ → 𝑒𝜈𝜇𝜈 Decay Channel with the ATLAS Detector at the LHC The Higgs boson takes a key position within the Standard Model and its underlying mechanism
is crucial in order to explain why elementary particles and especially the heavy vector bosons
have masses. Since its prediction in the early 1960s it took nearly 50 years until the existence
of the Higgs boson could be proven. It was on 4th July 2012 that two experiments—ATLAS (“A
Toroidal LHC ApparatuS”) and CMS (“Compact Muon Solenoid”)—at the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear research, announced a 5 𝜎 excess verifying the
existence of the Higgs boson. Its mass amounts about 125 GeV∕c
2 making the observation compatible
with earlier exclusion limits.
In January 2012 by the time the work on this thesis started, the confirmation of the Higgs boson
existence was anticipated and further steps based on this hypothesis were contemplated. For this
reason an analysis of the Higgs boson quantum numbers for spin and 𝐶𝑃 eigenvalue was initiated.
These quantities are crucial to verify the agreement between the later discovered resonance and
the Standard Model expectation. For the analysis the decay channel 𝐻 → 𝑊 𝑊 ∗ → 𝑒𝜈𝜇𝜈 was
chosen, which features a high cross section times branching ratio in the anticipated mass regime.
In spite of the two neutrinos in the final state the signature of the final state is clearly selectable
and can rely on the precise missing transverse momentum reconstruction of the ATLAS detector.
The contributions to the above publications comprise studies and development work for a wide
range of aspects of the published analysis such as the definition of sensitive and backgroundenriched
regions in the measured variable space, studies of multivariate techniques to optimise the
sensitivity, support of the reweighting studies for the 𝐶𝑃 -mixing analysis, implementation and
impact estimation of systematic uncertainties and further fields.
The major focus though was set on Monte Carlo event generator comparison studies and the statistical
evaluation to obtain final results taking background processes and systematic uncertainties
into account. A unique feature of the thesis is the evaluation of a sophisticated automated “smart”
binning of two-dimensional qualifier outputs from the applied multivariate analysis techniques.
First exclusion limits for non-Standard-Model spin and 𝐶𝑃 properties of the Higgs boson could
be set already in 2013 and further improved in 2015. The analysis presented in this thesis can
exclude all tested spin-2 models at a confidence level of 82.5 to 99.1 %. Two non-Standard-Model
𝐶𝑃 scenarios (CP-odd and CP-even with higher dimensional couplings to Standard Model particles)
can be excluded respectively at 97.1 and 64.5 % confidence level. Combining the results
from all bosonic decay channels at ATLAS each tested spin-2 and 𝐶𝑃 scenario can be excluded
at more than 99.9 % confidence level.
The newly introduced “smart” binning procedure is shown to be working reliably and takes a
stand as a promising tool for future high energy physics analyses.",1
44650,2,"Investigating the high-frequency spectral features of SNRs Tycho, W44 and IC443 with the Sardinia Radio Telescope The main characteristics in the radio continuum spectra of Supernova Remnants (SNRs) result from simple synchrotron emission. In addition, electron acceleration mechanisms can shape the spectra in specific ways, especially at high radio frequencies. These features are connected to the age and the peculiar conditions of the local interstellar medium interacting with the SNR. Whereas the bulk radio emission is expected at up to $20-50$ GHz, sensitive high-resolution images of SNRs above 10 GHz are lacking and are not easily achievable, especially in the confused regions of the Galactic Plane. In the framework of the early science observations with the Sardinia Radio Telescope in February-March 2016, we obtained high-resolution images of SNRs Tycho, W44 and IC443 that provided accurate integrated flux density measurements at 21.4 GHz: 8.8 $\pm$ 0.9 Jy for Tycho, 25 $\pm$ 3 Jy for W44 and 66 $\pm$ 7 Jy for IC443. We coupled the SRT measurements with radio data available in the literature in order to characterise the integrated and spatially-resolved spectra of these SNRs, and to find significant frequency- and region-dependent spectral slope variations. For the first time, we provide direct evidence of a spectral break in the radio spectral energy distribution of W44 at an exponential cutoff frequency of 15 $\pm$ 2 GHz. This result constrains the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons in the range $6-13$ GeV, in agreement with predictions indirectly derived from AGILE and \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray observations. With regard to IC443, our results confirm the noticeable presence of a bump in the integrated spectrum around $20-70$ GHz that could result from a spinning dust emission mechanism.",1
44676,2,"Ultraluminous X-ray sources as neutrino pulsars The classical limit on the accretion luminosity of a neutron star is given by the Eddington luminosity. The advanced models of accretion on to magnetized neutron stars account for the appearance of magnetically confined accretion columns and allow the accretion luminosity to be higher than the Eddington value by a factor of tens. However, the recent discovery of pulsations from ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 5907 demonstrates that the accretion luminosity can exceed the Eddington value up to by a factor of 500. We propose a model explaining observational properties of ULX-1 in NGC 5907 without any ad hoc assumptions. We show that the accretion column at extreme luminosity becomes advective. Enormous energy release within a small geometrical volume and advection result in very high temperatures at the bottom of accretion column, which demand to account for the energy losses due to neutrino emission which can be even more effective than the radiation energy losses. We show that the total luminosity at the mass accretion rates above 10^21 g s^−1 is dominated by the neutrino emission similarly to the case of core-collapse supernovae. We argue that the accretion rate measurements based on detected photon luminosity in case of bright ULXs powered by neutron stars can be largely underestimated due to intense neutrino emission. The recently discovered pulsating ULX-1 in galaxy NGC 5907 with photon luminosity of $${\sim } 10^{41}\, {\rm erg\ \rm s^{-1}}$$ is expected to be even brighter in neutrinos and is thus the first known Neutrino Pulsar.",1
44689,2,"First operational experience with the HIE-Isolde helium cryogenic system including several RF cryo-modules The High Intensity and Energy ISOLDE (HIE-ISOLDE) upgrade project at CERN includes the deployment of new superconducting accelerating structures operated at 4.5 K (ultimately of six cryo-modules) installed in series, and the refurbishing of the helium cryo-plant previously used to cool the ALEPH magnet during the operation of the LEP accelerator from 1989 to 2000. The helium refrigerator is connected to a new cryogenic distribution line, supplying a 2000-liter storage dewar and six interconnecting valve boxes (i.e jumper boxes), one for each cryo-module. After a first operation period with one cryo-module during six months in 2015, a second cryo-module has been installed and operated during 2016. The operation of the cryo-plant with these two cryo-modules has required significant technical enhancements and tunings for the compressor station, the cold-box and the cryogenic distribution system in order to reach nominal and stable operational conditions. The present paper describes the commissioning results and the lessons learnt during the operation campaign of 2016 together with the preliminary experience acquired during the 2017 operation phase with a third cryo-module.",1
44700,2,"Spin Chirality and Hall-Like Transport Phenomena of Spin Excitations Experimental and theoretical aspects of Hall-type transport of spins in magnetic insulators are reviewed. A general formalism for linear response theory of thermal Hall transport in the spin model is developed, which is general enough to be applicable to both the magnon and the paramagnetic, spin-liquid regimes. The expression of the energy current operator in the spin language is shown to be closely related to the spin chirality operator. Recent experiments on magnon-mediated thermal Hall transport in the two-dimensional kagome, and three-dimensional pyrochlore ferromagnetic insulators are reviewed in light of the multi-band magnon theory of Hall transport, and compared to the more mysterious thermal Hall transport found in the putative quantum spin ice material. As realizations of spin-chirality driven magnon transport in the real space, we review the general theory of emergent gauge fields governing the magnon dynamics in the textured magnet, and discuss its application to the magnon–Skyrmion scattering problem. Topological magnon Hall effect driven by the Skyrmion texture is discussed.",1
44715,2,"Edge insulating topological phases in a two-dimensional superconductor with long-range pairing We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a two-dimensional square lattice loaded by spinless fermions, with nearest-neighbor hopping and algebraically decaying pairing. We find that for sufficiently long-range pairing, new phases occur, not continuously connected with any short-range phase and not belonging to the standard families of topological insulators/superconductors. These phases are signaled by the violation of the area law for the von Neumann entropy, by semi-integer Chern numbers, and by edge modes with nonzero mass. The latter feature results in the absence of single-fermion edge conductivity, present instead in the short-range limit. The definition of a bulk-topology and the presence of a bulk-boundary correspondence is suggested also for the long-range phases. Recent experimental proposals and advances open the possibility to probe the described long-range effects in near-future realistic setups.",1

An adjustment of the force parameters is then performed in both cases to remove any double counting generated by the explicit computation of beyond-mean-field corrections with the Skyrme force. In addition, we include at second order the rearrangement terms associated with the density-dependent part of the Skyrme force and discuss their effect.

The Hamiltonian for the triaxial rotor is obtained up to next-to-leading order within the effective field theory formalism. Its applicability is examined by comparing with a five-dimensional rotor-vibrator Hamiltonian for the description of the energy spectra of the ground state and $ \gamma$ band in Ru isotopes. It is found that by taking into account the next-to-leading order corrections, the ground state band in the whole spin region and the $ \gamma$ band in the low spin region are well described. The deviations for high-spin states in the $ \gamma$ bands point towards the importance of including vibrational degrees of freedom in the effective field theory formulation.",1

While the low-level rf system is able to stabilize the vector sum of the accelerating gradient of one rf station sufficiently, the rf parameters of individual cavities vary within the bunch-train. In correlation with misalignments, intrabunch-train trajectory variations are induced. An efficient model is developed to describe the effect at low beam energy, using numerically adjusted transfer matrices and discrete coupler kick coefficients, respectively. Comparison with start-to-end tracking and dedicated experiments at the FLASH injector will be shown. The short computation time of the derived model allows for comprehensive numerical studies on the impact of misalignments and variable rf parameters on the transverse intra-bunch-train beam stability at the injector module. Results from both, statistical multibunch performance studies and the deduction of misalignments from multibunch experiments are presented.",1
45018,2,"Unified ab initio approaches to nuclear structure and reactions The description of nuclei starting from the constituent nucleons and the realistic interactions among them has been a long-standing goal in nuclear physics. In addition to the complex nature of the nuclear forces, with two-, three- and possibly higher many-nucleon components, one faces the quantum-mechanical many-nucleon problem governed by an interplay between bound and continuum states. In recent years, significant progress has been made in ab initio nuclear structure and reaction calculations based on input from QCD-employing Hamiltonians constructed within chiral effective field theory. After a brief overview of the field, we focus on ab initio many-body approaches—built upon the no-core shell model—that are capable of simultaneously describing both bound and scattering nuclear states, and present results for resonances in light nuclei, reactions important for astrophysics and fusion research. In particular, we review recent calculations of resonances in the (6)He halo nucleus, of five- and six-nucleon scattering, and an investigation of the role of chiral three-nucleon interactions in the structure of (9)Be. Further, we discuss applications to the (7)Be ${({\rm{p}},\gamma )}^{8}{\rm{B}}$ radiative capture.

45056,2,"Observation of High Transformer Ratio of Shaped Bunch Generated by an Emittance-Exchange Beam Line Collinear wakefield acceleration has been long established as a method capable of generating ultrahigh acceleration gradients. Because of the success on this front, recently, more efforts have shifted towards developing methods to raise the transformer ratio (TR). This figure of merit is defined as the ratio of the peak acceleration field behind the drive bunch to the peak deceleration field inside the drive bunch. TR is always less than 2 for temporally symmetric drive bunch distributions and therefore recent efforts have focused on generating asymmetric distributions to overcome this limitation. In this Letter, we report on using the emittance-exchange method to generate a shaped drive bunch to experimentally demonstrate a TR≈5 in a dielectric wakefield accelerator.",1

45168,2,"Recent Heavy Flavors results from Tevatron on behalf of the CDF and D0 Collaborations We present the latest Heavy Flavor
physics results from CDF and D0 Collaborations at the FNAL Tevatron. This
includes a confirmation of the X(5568) state with semileptonic decays of Bs
meson, a search for exotic baryons decaying to J/ψΛ pairs and a measurement of D
+-meson production cross section at low transverse momentum. 1 D0: Confirmation
of the X(5568) with semileptonic decays of B s meson Recently the D0
collaboration presented evidence for a possible four-quark state with the decay
to B 0 s π ± where B 0 s → J/ψφ 1. This system would be composed of two quarks
and two antiquarks of four different flavors b, s, u, d. When the selection on
the angle between the B 0 s and π ± was imposed (∆R = ∆η 2 + ∆φ 2 < 0.3) the
X(5568) was observed with a significance 5.1σ (including the systematic
uncertainties and look-elsewhere effect). Subsequent analysis by LHCb 2 and CMS
3 have not confirmed the existence of X(5568) in pp interactions at √ s = 7 and
8 TeV/c 2. Thus, the additional studies of B 0 s π ± final state are very
important. We present here a search for X(5568) in the decay to B 0 s π ± using
semileptonic B 0 s decays, B 0 s → µ D ± s + X (charge conjugate states are
assumed) from the full Run II integrated lumi-nosity of 10.4 fb −1 in p¯ p
collisions. Here X includes the unseen neutrino and possibly other hadrons from
the B 0 s decay. The background in semileptonic channel are mostly independent
of those in the hadronic channel. The presence of the neutrino in the final
state leads to the wider mass resolution for the signal. The character of
possible reflections of other resonant structures is quite different in the
semileptonic and hadronic channels. Thus, a study of X(5568) in the semileptonic
decay channel may provide an independent confirmation of its existence. The
muons are required to have 3 < p T < 25 GeV/c. The D − s → φπ − , φ → K + K − is
reconstructed as follows. The two particles from φ decay are assumed to be kaons
and are required to have p T > 1.0 GeV/c, opposite charge and mass 1.012 < m(K +
K −) < 1.03 GeV/c 2. The charge of the third particle, assumed to be a pion, has
to be opposite to that of the muon. The three tracks are combined to form a
common D − s vertex. The D − s and B 0 s decay vertices should be well separated
from the primary vertex. The transverse momentum of the µ + D − s system is
required to satisfy the condition p T > 10 GeV/c. To minimize the effect of the
missing neutrino in the final state the effective mass is limited to 4.5 GeV/c 2
< m(µ + D − s) < m(B 0 s). A track representing the pion in the B 0 s π ±
combination is required to have transverse momentum 0.5 < p T (π) < 25 GeV/c. To
improve the resolution of the invariant mass of the B 0 s π ± system we define
the invariant mass as m(B 0 s π) = m(µ D ± s π) − m(µ D ± s) + m(B 0 s), where
m(B 0 s) = 5.3667 GeV/c 2. We study events as a function of mass in the range
5.506 < m(B 0 s π ±) < 5.906 GeV/c 2. The ∆R cut was not used in this analysis.
The background parametrization was taken from the Monte-Carlo (MC) background
sample generated using the PYTHIA 4 inclusive jet production model. To correct
for the effects of the trigger selection and the reconstruction on the data, we
weight each MC event so that the transverse momentum of the reconstructed muon
and the µD s system agree with those in the data. The m(B 0 s π ±) invariant
mass distribution of the MC background is modelled by: F bgr (m) = (c 1 · m 0 +
c 2 · m 2 0 + c 3 · m 3 0 + c 4 · m 4 0) · e c 5 ·m 0 +c 6 ·m 2 0 , (1) where m
= m(B 0 s π ±), m 0 = m − m thr , and m thr = 5.5063 GeV/c 2 is the B 0 s π ±
mass threshold. Several alternative parametrizations were also used to check the
fit stability and for background shape systematics estimation. The signal is
modelled by a relativistic Breit-Wigner function convolved with a Gaussian
detector resolution function which also takes into account the impact of the
unseen neutrino. The fit function has the form: F (m) = f sig · F sig (m, M X ,
Γ X) + f bgr · F bgr (m), (2) where F sig (m, M X , Γ X) is a signal function
described above, M X and Γ X are the mass and natural width of the resonance and
f sig , f bgr are normalization factors. The shape parameters in the background
term F bgr are fixed to the values obtained from fitting the MC background
distribution. In the fit shown in Fig. 1 (left plot) the normalization
parameters f sig , f bgr and the Breit-Wigner parameters M X , Γ X are allowed
to vary. The fit yields the mass and natural width of M X = 5566.7 +3.6 −3.4
(stat.) +1.0 −1.0 (syst.) MeV/c 2 , Γ X = 6.0 +9.5 −6.0 (stat.) +1.9 −4.6
(syst.) MeV/c 2 , and the number of signal events of N = 139 +51 −63 (stat.) +11
−32 (syst.). These numbers include the systematic uncertainties due to
background shape description, background reweighting, B 0 s mass scale in MC and
data, detector resolution and the missing neutrino effect, signal modelling. The
dominant systematic uncertainty is due to the background shape description. The
local statistical significance of the signal, defined as −2 ln(L 0 /L max),
where L 0 , L max are likelihood values at the signal yield fixed to zero and at
the best-fit signal yield obtained from a binned maximum likelihood fit, is
4.5σ. If the systematic uncertainties are taken into account, the statistical
significance of the signal is 3.2σ. The ratio of the number of B 0 s which come
from the decay of X(5568) to all B 0 s (X(5568) production ratio) was measured
to be [7.3 +2.8 −2.4 (stat.) +0.6 −1.7 (syst.)]% in the semileptonic channel.
The mass, natural width and X(5568) production ratio are in the agreement
between the semileptonic and hadronic channels within uncertainties 1. If we
assume that we observe the same object in both channels and the semileptonic and
hadronic measurements are independent, we can calculate the combined
significance for the two channels using the formula to calculate the combined
p-value: p comb = p had · p sl · [1 − ln(p had · p sl)], where p had is the
p-value for the hadronic channel, and p sl is the p-value for the semileptonic
channel. The obtained combined 5.55 5.6 5.65 5.7 5.75 5.8 5.85 5.9 0 50 100 150

45255,2,"Laser-Frequency Stabilization via a Quasimonolithic Mach-Zehnder Interferometer with Arms of Unequal Length and Balanced dc Readout Low-frequency high-precision laser interferometry is subject to excess laser-frequency-noise coupling via arm-length differences which is commonly mitigated by locking the frequency to a stable reference system. This approach is crucial to achieve picometer-level sensitivities in the 0.1-mHz to 1-Hz regime, where laser-frequency noise is usually high and couples into the measurement phase via arm-length mismatches in the interferometers. Here we describe the results achieved by frequency stabilizing an external cavity diode laser to a quasimonolithic unequal arm-length Mach-Zehnder interferometer readout at midfringe via balanced detection. We find this stabilization scheme to be an elegant solution combining a minimal number of optical components, no additional laser modulations, and relatively low-frequency-noise levels. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is designed and constructed to minimize the influence of thermal couplings and to reduce undesired stray light using the optical simulation tool ifocad. We achieve frequency-noise levels below 100  Hz/Hz at 1 Hz and are able to demonstrate the LISA frequency prestabilization requirement of 300  Hz/Hz down to frequencies of 100 mHz by beating the stabilized laser with an iodine-locked reference.",1

We consider the static spherically symmetric spacetime and choose the simplest model of this gravity, i.e., $ R+\alpha R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$ . To examine the basic features of compact stars like Her X-1, SAX J 1808.4-3658 and 4U 1820-30, we apply analytic solutions of Krori and Barua metric using the mass-radius relation. We study the behavior of effective energy density, pressure, equation of state parameter and energy conditions in the interior of compact stars. We also explore the stability criteria of compact stars via the speed of sound. It is concluded that all the energy conditions are satisfied and the compact stars are found to be stable at the boundary for this particular model.",1
45322,2,"Mergers of accreting stellar-mass black holes We present post-Newtonian N-body simulations on mergers of accreting stellar-mass black holes (BHs), where such general relativistic effects as the pericentre shift and gravitational wave (GW) emission are taken into consideration. The attention is concentrated on the effects of the dynamical friction and the Hoyle–Lyttleton mass accretion by ambient gas. We consider a system composed of 10 BHs with initial mass of 30 M_⊙. As a result, we show that mergers of accreting stellar-mass BHs are classified into four types: a gas drag-driven, an interplay-driven, a three-body-driven, or an accretion-driven merger. We find that BH mergers proceed before significant mass accretion, even if the accretion rate is ∼10 Eddington accretion rate, and then all BHs can merge into one heavy BH. Using the simulation results for a wide range of parameters, we derive a critical accretion rate ($\dot{m}_{\rm c}$), below which the BH growth is promoted faster by mergers. Also, it is found that the effect of the recoil by the GW emission can reduce $\dot{m}_{\rm c}$ especially in gas number density higher than 10^8 cm^−3, and enhance the escape probability of merged BHs. Very recently, a gravitational wave event, GW150914, as a result of the merger of a ∼30 M_⊙ BH binary has been detected. Based on the present simulations, the BH merger in GW150914 is likely to be driven by three-body encounters accompanied by a few  M_⊙ of gas accretion, in high-density environments like dense interstellar clouds or galactic nuclei.",1
45327,2,"Simulation of transition radiation based beam imaging from tilted targets Transverse beam profile diagnostics in linear electron accelerators is usually based on direct imaging of a beam spot via visible transition radiation. In this case the fundamental resolution limit is determined by radiation diffraction in the optical system. A method to measure beam sizes beyond the diffraction limit is to perform imaging dominated by a single-particle function (SPF), i.e. when the recorded image is dominated not by the transverse beam profile but by the image function of a point source (single electron). Knowledge of the SPF for an experimental setup allows one to extract the transverse beam size from an SPF dominated image. This paper presents an approach that allows one to calculate two-dimensional SPF dominated beam images, taking into account the target inclination angle and the depth-of-field effect. In conclusion, a simple fit function for beam size determination in the case under consideration is proposed and its applicability is tested under various conditions.",1

The electron accelerator is based on the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) and the Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) principles. The FFAG arcs and the straight section of the accelerator are comprised of one focusing and one defocusing quadrupoles which are designed as Halbach-type permanent dipole magnets with quadrupoles component[***].

45356,2,"Double Weyl points and Fermi arcs of topological semimetals in non-Abelian gauge potentials We study the effect of a non-Abelian SU(2) gauge potential mimicking spin-orbit coupling on the topological semimetal induced by a magnetic field having π flux per plaquette and acting on fermions in a three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice. The Abelian π-flux term gives rise to a spectrum characterized by Weyl points. The non-Abelian term is chosen to be gauge equivalent to both a 2D Rashba and a Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. As a result of the anisotropic nature of the coupling between spin and momentum and of the presence of a C4 rotation symmetry, when the non-Abelian part is turned on, the Weyl points assume a quadratic dispersion along two directions and constitute double monopoles for the Berry curvature. We examine the main features of this system both analytically and numerically, focusing on its gapless surface modes, the so-called Fermi arcs. We discuss the stability of the system under confining hard-wall and harmonic potentials, relevant for the implementation in ultracold atom settings, and the effect of rotation symmetry breaking.",1

45562,2,"Experimental Observation of Bethe Strings Almost one century ago, string states - complex bound states (Wellenkomplexe) of magnetic excitations - have been predicted to exist in one-dimensional quantum magnets and since then become a subject of intensive theoretical study. However, experimental realization and identification of string states in condensed-matter systems remains an unsolved challenge up to date. Here we use high-resolution terahertz spectroscopy to identify string states in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg-Ising chain SrCo2V2O8 in strong longitudinal magnetic fields. We observe complex bound states (strings) and fractional magnetic excitations (psinons and antipsinons) in the field-induced critical regime, which are precisely described by the Bethe ansatz. Our study reveals that two-string and three-string states govern the quantum spin dynamics close to the quantum criticality, while the fractional excitations are dominant at low energies, reflecting the antiferromagnetic quantum fluctuations.",1

A 200 µg/cm2 carbon stripping foil will convert H− into protons by stripping off the electrons. The H− charge-exchange injection principle will be used for the first time in the CERN accelerator complex and involves many challenges. In order to gain experience with the foil changing mechanism and the very fragile foils, in 2016, prior to the installation in the PSB, a stripping foil test stand has been installed in the Linac4 transfer line. In addition, parts of the future PSB injection equipment are also temporarily installed in the Linac4 transfer line for tests with a 160 MeV H− commissioning proton beam.

45604,2,"Design and first operation of a supersonic gas jet based beam profile monitor Noninterceptive beam profile monitors are of great importance for many particle accelerators worldwide. Extra challenges are posed by high energy, high intensity machines and low energy low intensity accelerators. For these applications, existing diagnostics are no longer suitable due to the high power of the beam or the very low intensity. In addition, many other accelerators, from medical to industrial will benefit from a noninvasive, real time beam profile monitor. In this paper we present a new beam profile monitor with a novel design for the nozzle and skimmer configuration to generate a supersonic gas jet meeting ultrahigh vacuum conditions and we describe the first results for such a beam profile monitor at the Cockcroft Institute. This monitor is able to measure two-dimensional profiles of the particle beam while causing negligible disturbance to the beam or to the accelerator vacuum. The ultimate goal for this diagnostic is to provide a versatile and universal beam profile monitor suitable for measuring any beams.",1
45616,2,"Beam Loss Monitoring for Demanding Environments Beam loss monitoring (BLM) is a key protection system for machines using beams with damage potential and is an essential beam diagnostic tool for any machine. All BLM systems are based on the observation of secondary particle showers originating from escaping beam particles. With ever higher beam energies and intensities, the loss of even a tiny fraction of the beam can lead to damage or, in the case of superconducting machines, quenches. Losses also lead to material ageing and activation and should therefore be well controlled and reduced to a minimum. The ideal BLM system would have full machine coverage and the capability to accurately quantify the number of lost beam particles from the measured secondary shower. Position and time resolution, dynamic range, noise levels and radiation hardness all have to be considered, while at the same time optimising the system for reliability, availability and maintainability. This contribution will focus on design choices for BLM systems operating in demanding environments, with a special emphasis on measuring particle losses in the presence of synchrotron radiation and other background sources.",1

45703,2,"Multi-photon Effects in Single Nonlinear Compton Scattering and Single Nonlinear Breit-Wheeler Process in Ultra Intense Fields Nonlinear Compton scattering (NCS) and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler (NBW) process are strongly multi-photon and highly nonlinear processes. In ultra intense lasers (normalized field amplitude $a_0 \gg 1$), radiation formation length is much shorter than a period and single NCS/NBW cannot be described as scatterings of electrons dressing plane waves with $\gamma$ photons for what they feel is a local constant crossed field. However, present theories in constant crossed fields are hard to give some important quantum features due to divergence problems, such as number of laser photons involved, instantaneous angular distribution and detailed spectrum. As an alternative, present understanding of single NCS/NBW in ultra intense lasers includes several classical and semi-quantum ideas such as forward emission, recoil reaction and spectrum cutoff. We investigated multi-photon effects on NCS/NBW in ultra intense lasers by extracting the number of laser photons involved in a single process in ultra intense lasers from formulae of existing theories. New features of single NCS in ultra intense lasers including fixed emission angle to instantaneous electron momentum, instantaneous deflection of electron, and disappearance of spectrum cutoff are deduced. Similar features of single NBW in ultra intense lasers including non-vanishing emission angles to instantaneous $\gamma$ photon momentum, disappearance of spectrum cutoff and appearance of spectrum lower limit are also obtained. Simulations show that corresponding signals of multi-photon effects are significant on $10$PW scale and stronger lasers.",1

45765,2,"Dark matter self-interactions from the internal dynamics of dwarf spheroidals Using the dataset of stellar kinematics for the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we underpin the goodness of the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) proposal as a solution to the ""too-big-to-fail"" problem through a detailed fit of the stellar velocity dispersion profiles. The kinematic data are consistent with SIDM if we allow for spatially varying stellar orbital anisotropies. We provide the first data-driven estimate for the SIDM cross-section per unit mass probed by these galaxies, pointing to $\sigma/m \sim$ 0.5 - 3 cm$^{2}$g$^{-1}$, in good agreement with recent estimates from the study of the dynamics in spiral galaxies. Our results well match the trends previously observed in pure SIDM N-body simulations. The analysis in this work outlines a complementary approach to simulations in testing SIDM with astrophysical observations.",1
45878,2,"Testing modified gravity using a marked correlation function In theories of modified gravity with the chameleon screening mechanism, the strength of the fifth force depends on environment. This induces an environment dependence of structure formation, which differs from $\Lambda$CDM. We show that these differences can be captured by the marked correlation function. With the galaxy correlation functions and number densities calibrated to match between $f(R)$ and $\Lambda$CDM models in simulations, we show that the marked correlation functions from using either the local density or halo mass as the marks encode extra information, which can be used to test these theories. We discuss possible applications of these statistics in observations.",1
45932,2,"Accretion Acceleration of Neutron Stars and Effects of Gravitational Radiation In this paper we studied the neutron star's spin acceleration in the accretion process of the neutron star binary system, and the relation how the spin period changes with the accreted mass. We analyzed further the evolutions of both magnetic field and spin period of a neutron star, and compared the modeled results with the observational data of pulsars, to show that they are consistent with each other. Based on above studies, we investigated the effect of gravitational radiation on the spin-up process of a neutron star, and derived the change rate of the neutron star's spin period in the accretion process. We also estimated the critical angular velocity Ω cr , at which the accretion torque is balanced by that of gravitational radiation, and discussed the influence of gravitational radiation on the neutron star's spin evolution.",1
45957,2,"Tomographic imaging of the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray sky through cross-correlations: A wider and deeper look We investigate the nature of the extragalactic unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) by cross-correlating several galaxy catalogs with sky-maps of the UGRB built from 78 months of Pass 8 Fermi-Large Area Telescope data. This study updates and improves similar previous analyses in several aspects. Firstly, the use of a larger gamma-ray dataset allows us to investigate the energy dependence of the cross-correlation in more detail, using up to 8 energy bins over a wide energy range of [0.25-500] GeV. Secondly, we consider larger and deeper catalogs (2MASS Photometric-Redshift catalog, 2MPZ; WISE x SuperCOSMOS, WISC; and SDSS-DR12 photometric-redshift dataset) in addition to the ones employed in the previous studies (NVSS and SDSS-QSOs). Thirdly, we exploit the redshift information available for the above catalogs to divide them into redshift bins and perform the cross-correlation separately in each of them. Our results confirm, with higher statistical significance, the detection of cross-correlation signal between the UGRB maps and all the catalogs considered, on angular scales smaller than 1 degree. Significances range from 16.3 sigma for NVSS, 7 sigma for SDSS-DR12 and WISC, 5 sigma for 2MPZ and 4 sigma for SDSS-QSOs. Furthermore, including redshift tomography, the significance of the SDSS-DR12 signal strikingly rises up to 12 sigma and the one of WISC to 10.6 sigma. We offer a simple interpretation of the signal in the framework of the halo model. The precise redshift and energy information allows us to clearly detect a change over redshift in the spectral and clustering behavior of the gamma-ray sources contributing to the UGRB.",1

45976,2,"Logarithmic violation of scaling in anisotropic kinematic dynamo model Inertial-range asymptotic behavior of a vector (e.g., magnetic) field, passively advected by a strongly anisotropic turbulent flow, is studied by means of the field theoretic renormalization group and the operator product expansion. The advecting velocity field is Gaussian, not correlated in time, with the pair correlation function of the form ∝δ(t−t′)/k⊥d−1+ξ, where k⊥ = |k⊥| and k⊥ is the component of the wave vector, perpendicular to the distinguished direction. The stochastic advection-diffusion equation for the transverse (divergence-free) vector field includes, as special cases, the kinematic dynamo model for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and the linearized Navier–Stokes equation. In contrast to the well known isotropic Kraichnan’s model, where various correlation functions exhibit anomalous scaling behavior with infinite sets of anomalous exponents, here the dependence on the integral turbulence scale L has a logarithmic behavior: instead of power-like corrections to ordinary scaling, determined by naive (canonical) dimensions, the anomalies manifest themselves as polynomials of logarithms of L.",1
45981,2,"Quantum sine-Gordon dynamics on analogue curved spacetime in a weakly imperfect scalar Bose gas Using the coherent state functional integral expression of the partition function, we show that the sine-Gordon model on an analogue curved spacetime arises as the effective quantum field theory for phase fluctuations of a weakly imperfect Bose gas on an incompressible background superfluid flow when these fluctuations are restricted to a subspace of the single-particle Hilbert space. We consider bipartitions of the single-particle Hilbert space relevant to experiments on ultracold bosonic atomic or molecular gases, including, e.g., restriction to high- or low-energy sectors of the dynamics and spatial bipartition corresponding to tunnel-coupled planar Bose gases. By assuming full unitary quantum control in the low-energy subspace of a trapped gas, we show that (1) appropriately tuning the particle number statistics of the lowest-energy mode partially decouples the low- and high-energy sectors, allowing any low-energy single-particle wave function to define a background for sine-Gordon dynamics on curved spacetime and (2) macroscopic occupation of a quantum superposition of two states of the lowest two modes produces an analogue curved spacetime depending on two background flows, with respective weights continuously dependent on the corresponding weights of the superposed quantum states.",1

For a split real form of a complex simple Lie group, we compute the dimension of apparent parabolic Teichm\""uller components. In the case of isometry groups of classical Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type, we provide new topological invariants for parabolic maximal $G$-Higgs bundles arising from a correspondence to orbifold Higgs bundles. Using orbifold cohomology we count the least number of connected components of moduli spaces of such objects.

46062,2,"The effect of frequency chirping on electron-positron pair production in the one- and two-color laser pulse fields The effect of the frequency chirping on momentum spectrum and pair production rate in one- and two-color laser pulse fields is investigated by solving the quantum Vlasov equation. A small frequency chirp shifts the momentum spectrum along the momentum axis. The positive and negative frequency chirp parameters play the same role in increasing the pair number density. The sign change of frequency chirp parameter at the moment $t=0$ leads pulse shape and momentum spectrum to be symmetric, and the number density to be increased. The number density of produced pairs in the two-color pulse field is much higher than that in the one-color pulse field and the larger frequency chirp pulse field dominates more strongly. In the two-color pulse fields, the relation between the frequency ratio of two colors and the number density is not sensitive to the parameters of small frequency chirp added in either low frequency strong field or high frequency weak field but sensitive to the parameters of large frequency chirp added in high frequency weak field.",1

The optical detection of H$_{2}$ and CO molecules with large ground-based telescopes (as the ESO-VLT and the Keck telescopes), as well as the detection of H$_{2}$ with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope is discussed in the context of varying constants, and in connection to different theoretical scenarios. Radio astronomy provides an alternative search strategy bearing the advantage that molecules as NH$_{3}$ (ammonia) and CH$_{3}$OH (methanol) can be used, which are much more sensitive to a varying $\mu $ than diatomic molecules.

46238,2,"Non-Fermi liquid at the FFLO quantum critical point When a 2D superconductor is subjected to a strong in-plane magnetic field, Zeeman polarization of the Fermi surface can give rise to inhomogeneous FFLO order with a spatially modulated gap. Further increase of the magnetic field eventually drives the system into a normal metal state. Here, we perform a renormalization group analysis of this quantum phase transition, starting from an appropriate low-energy theory recently introduced by Piazza et al. (Ref.1). We compute one-loop flow equations within the controlled dimensional regularization scheme with fixed dimension of Fermi surface, expanding in $\epsilon = 5/2 - d$. We find a new stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point and discuss its critical properties. One of the most interesting aspects of the FFLO non-Fermi liquid scenario is that the quantum critical point is potentially naked, with the scaling regime observable down to arbitrary low temperatures. In order to study this possibility, we perform a general analysis of competing instabilities, which suggests that only charge density wave order is enhanced in the vicinity of the quantum critical point.",1

46327,2,"Magnetic Prandtl number dependence of turbulence generated by chiral MHD dynamos An asymmetry in the number density of left- and right-handed fermions is known to give rise to a new term in the induction equation that can result in a small-scale instability. This is a microphysical effect characterised by a chiral chemical potential and is mathematically similar to the alpha effect, which is a turbulent or macrophysical effect. At high temperatures, when a chiral asymmetry can survive for long enough, these chiral MHD dynamos can amplify magnetic fields efficiently, which in turn drive turbulence via the Lorentz force. While it has been demonstrated in numerical simulations that chiral magnetically driven turbulence exists and modifies the evolution of the plasma, the details of this process remain unclear. The goal of this paper is to shed new light on the properties of chiral magnetically driven turbulence using numerical simulations with the Pencil Code. We explore the generation of turbulence for different initial conditions, including a variation of the initial chiral chemical potential and the magnetic Prandtl number, Pm. In particular, we determine the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energy, Upsilon^2, that can be reached in chiral magnetically driven turbulence. Within the parameter space explored in this study, Upsilon reaches a value of approximately 0.24-0.29 - independently of the initial chiral asymmetry and for Pm=1. Our simulations suggest, that Upsilon decreases as a power law when increasing Pm. While the exact scaling depends on the details of the fitting criteria and the Reynolds number regime, an approximate result of Upsilon(Pm)=0.3*Pm^{-0.2} is reported. Using the findings from our numerical simulations, we estimate the properties of chiral magnetically driven turbulence in the early Universe.",1
46422,2,"An Analysis of Heavy-Ion Elastic Scattering Processes Using Numerical Model Based on the Partial Wave Parameterised S-Matrix with Regge Pole Factor Analyses of the angular distributions in the elastic scattering processes of$^{9, 10, 11}$Be by the target nucleus$^{64}$Zn at the laboratory energies of 27.95 MeV, and$^{4, 6, 8}$He by the target nucleus$^{208}$Pb at the laboratory energy of 22 MeV are performed. These analyses rely on a numerical model based on a parameterised scattering matrix (S-matrix) derived from Frahn and Venter. They confirm the absence of the Coulomb rainbow peak in angular distributions of elastic scattering in collisions of halo nuclei at energies around the Coulomb barrier. The correlation between the total reaction cross section and the halo structure for each scattering that involves a halo nucleus is discussed, and values of the total reaction cross section are found comparable with those of others. The diffractive features of the systems$^{16, 18}$O + $^{19}$F at specific laboratory energies are examined, and the effect of exchanging the projectile and target nuclei at such energies on these features are inspected. The incorporation of the Regge pole factor into the parameterised S-matrix calculations, which is found important in some cases, is employed in order to account for the oscillatory structure (if available) at backward angles.

This condition not only guarantees the reality of the eigenvalues of Hamiltonian operators, but also implies the preservation of the probabilities of the considered quantum processes. However as it was shown relatively recently (Bender and Boettcher Phys Rev Lett 80:5243, 1998), Hermiticity is a sufficient but it is not a necessary condition. It turned out that among non-Hermitian Hamiltonians it is possible to allocate a number of such which have real energy spectra and can ensure the development of systems over time with preserving unitarity. This type of Hamiltonians includes so-called parity-time ( $\mathcal{PT}$ ) symmetric models which is already used in various fields of modern physics. The most developed in this respect are models, which used in the field of $\mathcal{PT}$ -symmetric optics, where for several years produced not only theoretical but experimental studies.",1
46649,2,"Bulk characterization of topological crystalline insulators: Stability under interactions and relations to symmetry enriched $U (1)$ quantum spin liquids Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) are nontrivial quantum phases of matter protected by crystalline (and other) symmetries. They are originally predicted by band theories, so an important question is their stability under interactions. In this paper, by directly studying the physical bulk properties of several band-theory-based nontrivial TCIs that are conceptually interesting and/or experimentally feasible, we show they are stable under interactions. These TCIs include (1) a weak topological insulator, (2) a TCI with a mirror symmetry and its time-reversal symmetric generalizations, (3) a doubled topological insulator with a mirror symmetry, and (4) two TCIs with symmetry-enforced-gapless surfaces. We describe two complementary methods that allow us to determine the properties of the magnetic monopoles obtained by coupling these TCIs to a U(1) gauge field. These methods involve studying different types of surface states of these TCIs. Applying these methods to our examples, we find all of them have nontrivial monopoles, which proves their stability under interactions. Furthermore, we discuss two levels of relations between these TCIs and symmetry enriched U(1) quantum spin liquids (QSLs). First, these TCIs are directly related to U(1) QSLs with crystalline symmetries. Second, there is an interesting correspondence between U(1) QSLs with crystalline symmetries and U(1) QSLs with internal symmetries. In particular, the TCIs with symmetry-enforced-gapless surfaces are related to the “fractional topological paramagnets” introduced in Zou et al. [arXiv:1710.00743].",1
46664,2,"Sachs’ free data in real connection variables We discuss the Hamiltonian dynamics of general relativity with real connection variables on a null foliation, and use the Newman-Penrose formalism to shed light on the geometric meaning of the various constraints. We identify the equivalent of Sachs’ constraint-free initial data as projections of connection components related to null rotations, i.e. the translational part of the ISO(2) group stabilising the internal null direction soldered to the hypersurface. A pair of second-class constraints reduces these connection components to the shear of a null geodesic congruence, thus establishing equivalence with the second-order formalism, which we show in details at the level of symplectic potentials. A special feature of the first-order formulation is that Sachs’ propagating equations for the shear, away from the initial hypersurface, are turned into tertiary constraints, their role is to preserve the relation between connection and shear under retarded time evolution. The conversion of wave-like propagating equations into constraints is possible thanks to an algebraic Bianchi identity, the same one that allows one to describe the radiative data at future null infinity in terms of a shear of a (non-geodesic) asymptotic null vector field in the physical spacetime. Finally, we compute the modification to the spin coefficients and the null congruence in the presence of torsion.",1
46689,2,"Majorana-time-reversal symmetries: a fundamental principle for sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations A fundamental open issue in physics is whether and how the fermion sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations can be solved generically. Here, we show that Majorana-time-reversal (MTR) symmetries can provide a unifying principle to solve the fermion sign problem in interacting fermionic models. By systematically classifying Majorana-bilinear operators according to the anticommuting MTR symmetries they respect, we rigorously prove that there are two and only two fundamental symmetry classes which are sign-problem-free and which we call the “Majorana class” and “Kramers class,” respectively. Novel sign-problem-free models in the Majorana class include interacting topological superconductors and interacting models of charge-4e superconductors. We believe that our MTR unifying principle could shed new light on sign-problem-free QMC simulation on strongly correlated systems and interacting topological matters.",1
46701,2,"Affine Gaudin models and hypergeometric functions on affine opers We conjecture that quantum Gaudin models in affine types admit families of higher Hamiltonians, labelled by the (countably infinite set of) exponents, whose eigenvalues are given by functions on a space of meromorphic opers associated with the Langlands dual Lie algebra. This is in direct analogy with the situation in finite types. However, in stark contrast to finite types, we prove that in affine types such functions take the form of hypergeometric integrals, over cycles of a twisted homology defined by the levels of the modules at the marked points. That result prompts the further conjecture that the Hamiltonians themselves are naturally expressed as such integrals. We go on to describe the space of meromorphic affine opers on an arbitrary Riemann surface. We prove that it fibres over the space of meromorphic connections on the canonical line bundle $\Omega$. Each fibre is isomorphic to the direct product of the space of sections of the square of $\Omega$ with the direct product, over the exponents $j$ not equal to 1, of the twisted cohomology of the $j^{\rm th}$ tensor power of $\Omega$.",1
46735,2,"Capacitively coupled pickup in MCP-based photodetectors using a conductive metallic anode We have designed and tested a robust 20x20 cm$^2$ thin metal film internal anode capacitively coupled to an external array of signal pads or micro-strips for use in fast microchannel plate photodetectors. The internal anode, in this case a 10nm-thick NiCr film deposited on a 96% pure Al2O3 3mm-thick ceramic plate and connected to HV ground, provides the return path for the electron cascade charge. The multi-channel pickup array consists of a printed-circuit card or glass plate with metal signal pickups on one side and the signal ground plane on the other. The pickup can be put in close proximity to the bottom outer surface of the sealed photodetector, with no electrical connections through the photodetector hermetic vacuum package other than a single ground connection to the internal anode. Two pickup patterns were tested using a small commercial MCP-PMT as the signal source: 1) parallel 50W 25-cm-long micro-strips with an analog bandwidth of 1.5 GHz, and 2) a 20 20 cm2 array of 2-dimensional square ‘pads’ with sides of 1.27 cm or 2.54 cm. The rise-time of the fast input pulse is maintained for both pickup patterns. For the pad pattern, we observe 80% of the directly coupled amplitude. For the strip pattern we measure 34% of the directly coupled amplitude on the central strip of a broadened signal.",1
46736,2,"Gravitational decoupled anisotropies in compact stars Simple generic extensions of isotropic Durgapal–Fuloria stars to the anisotropic domain are presented. These anisotropic solutions are obtained by guided minimal deformations over the isotropic system. When the anisotropic sector interacts in a purely gravitational manner, the conditions to decouple both sectors by means of the minimal geometric deformation approach are satisfied. Hence the anisotropic field equations are isolated resulting a more treatable set. The simplicity of the equations allows one to manipulate the anisotropies that can be implemented in a systematic way to obtain different realistic models for anisotropic configurations. Later on, observational effects of such anisotropies when measuring the surface redshift are discussed. To conclude, the consistency of the application of the method over the obtained anisotropic configurations is shown. In this manner, different anisotropic sectors can be isolated of each other and modeled in a simple and systematic way.",1
46762,2,"Tiny Electromagnetic Explosions This paper considers electromagnetic transients of a modest total energy (${ \mathcal E }\gtrsim {10}^{40}$ erg) and small initial size (${ \mathcal R }\gtrsim {10}^{-1}$ cm). They could be produced during collisions between relativistic field structures (e.g., macroscopic magnetic dipoles) that formed around or before cosmic electroweak symmetry breaking. The outflowing energy has a dominant electromagnetic component, a subdominant thermal component (temperature $\gt 1$ GeV) supplies inertia in the form of residual ${e}^{\pm }$. A thin shell forms, expanding subluminally and attaining a Lorentz factor $\sim {10}^{6\mbox{--}7}$ before decelerating. Drag is supplied by the reflection of an ambient magnetic field and deflection of ambient free electrons. Emission of low-frequency (GHz–THz) superluminal waves takes place through three channels: (i) reflection of the ambient magnetic field, (ii) direct linear conversion of the embedded magnetic field into a superluminal mode, and (iii) excitation outside the shell by corrugation of its surface. The escaping electromagnetic pulse is very narrow (a few wavelengths), so the width of the detected transient is dominated by propagation effects. GHz radio transients are emitted from (i) the dark matter halos of galaxies and (ii) the near-horizon regions of supermassive black holes that formed via direct gas collapse and now accrete slowly. Brighter and much narrower 0.01–1 THz pulses are predicted at a rate at least comparable to fast radio bursts, experiencing weaker scattering and absorption. The same explosions also accelerate protons up to $\sim {10}^{19}$ eV, and heavier nuclei up to 10(20)(–)(21) eV.",1
46767,2,"Self-force and radiation reaction in general relativity [Abridged] This review surveys the theory of gravitational self-force in curved spacetime and its application to the gravitational two-body problem in the extreme-mass-ratio regime. We first lay the relevant formal foundation, describing the rigorous derivation of the equation of self-forced motion using matched asymptotic expansions and other ideas. We then review the progress that has been achieved in numerically calculating the self-force and its physical effects in the astrophysical scenario of a compact object inspiralling into a (rotating) massive black hole. We highlight the way in which, nowadays, self-force calculations make a fruitful contact with other approaches to the two-body problem and help inform an accurate universal model of binary black hole inspirals, valid across all mass ratios. We conclude with a summary of the state of the art, open problems and prospects. Our review is aimed at non-specialist readers and is for the most part self-contained and non-technical; only elementary-level acquaintance with General Relativity is assumed. Where useful, we draw on analogies with familiar concepts from Newtonian gravity or classical electrodynamics.",1

Additional innovative features include all cryogenic piping within the cryomodule (no parallel external cryogenic transfer line), long strings of RF cavities within a single cryomodule, and cryomodules connected in series. Several projects, including FLASH and XFEL at DESY, LCLS-II at SLAC, and the ILC technical design have adopted this general design concept. Advantages include saving space by eliminating the external transfer line, relatively tight packing of RF cavities along the beamline due to fewer warm-cold transitions, and potentially lower costs. However, a primary disadvantage is the relative lack of independence for warm-up, replacement, and cool-down of individual cryomodules.",1

So all orthogonal transformations of V are restrictions to V of inner automorphisms of the algebra. Thus under orthogonal transformations P and T—space and time reversal—all algebra elements, including vectors v and spinors φ, transform as v → xvx−1 and φ → xφx−1 for some algebra element x. We show that while under combined PT spinor φ → xφx−1 remains in its spinor space, under P or T separately φ goes to a different spinor space and may have opposite chirality. We conclude with a preliminary characterization of inner automorphisms with respect to their property to change, or not, spinor spaces.",1

Recently, the formation of the $\eta$ mesic nucleus in the fusion reactions of the light nuclei such as $d + d \rightarrow (\eta + \alpha) \rightarrow X$ has been proposed and the experiments have been performed by WASA-at-COSY. We develop a theoretical model to evaluate the formation rate of the $\eta$ mesic nucleus in the fusion reactions and show the calculated results. We find that the $\eta$ bound states could be observed in the reactions in cases with the strong attractive and small absorptive $\eta$ -nucleus interactions. We compare our results with existing data of the $d + d \rightarrow \eta + \alpha$ and the $d + d \rightarrow {}^{3}He + N + \pi$ reactions. We find that the analyses by our theoretical model with the existing data can provide new information on the $\eta$ -nucleus interaction.",1
46903,2,"Derivation of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics from the Boltzmann equation Fluid-dynamical equations of motion can be derived from the Boltzmann equation in terms of an expansion around a single-particle distribution function which is in local thermodynamical equilibrium, i.e., isotropic in momentum space in the rest frame of a fluid element. However, in situations where the single-particle distribution function is highly anisotropic in momentum space, such as the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies, such an expansion is bound to break down. Nevertheless, one can still derive a fluid-dynamical theory, called anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics, in terms of an expansion around a single-particle distribution function, f^0k, which incorporates (at least parts of) the momentum anisotropy via a suitable parametrization. We construct such an expansion in terms of polynomials in energy and momentum in the direction of the anisotropy and of irreducible tensors in the two-dimensional momentum subspace orthogonal to both the fluid velocity and the direction of the anisotropy. From the Boltzmann equation we then derive the set of equations of motion for the irreducible moments of the deviation of the single-particle distribution function from f^0k. Truncating this set via the 14-moment approximation, we obtain the equations of motion of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics.",1

47025,2,"On the radial distribution of Galactic cosmic rays The spectrum and morphology of the diffuse Galactic γ-ray emission carries valuable information on cosmic ray (CR) propagation. Recent results obtained by analyzing Fermi-LAT data accumulated over 7 yr of observation show a substantial variation of the CR spectrum as a function of the distance from the Galactic Centre. The spatial distribution of the CR density in the outer Galaxy appears to be weakly dependent upon the galactocentric distance, as found in previous studies as well, while the density in the central region of the Galaxy was found to exceed the value measured in the outer Galaxy. At the same time, Fermi-LAT data suggest a gradual spectral softening while moving outwards from the centre of the Galaxy to its outskirts. These findings represent a challenge for standard calculations of CR propagation based on assuming a uniform diffusion coefficient within the Galactic volume. Here, we present a model of non-linear CR propagation in which transport is due to particle scattering and advection off self-generated turbulence. We find that for a realistic distribution of CR sources following the spatial distribution of supernova remnants and the space dependence of the magnetic field on galactocentric distance, both the spatial profile of CR density and the spectral softening can easily be accounted for.",1
47041,2,"Relativistic wide-angle galaxy bispectrum on the light-cone Given the important role that the galaxy bispectrum has recently acquired in cosmology and the scale and precision of forthcoming galaxy clustering observations, it is timely to derive the full expression of the large-scale bispectrum going beyond approximated treatments which neglect integrated terms or higher-order bias terms or use the Limber approximation. On cosmological scales, relativistic effects that arise from observing the past light cone alter the observed galaxy number counts, therefore leaving their imprints on N-point correlators at all orders. In this paper we compute for the first time the bispectrum including all general relativistic, local and integrated, effects at second order, the tracers’ bias at second order, geometric effects as well as the primordial non-Gaussianity contribution. This is timely considering that future surveys will probe scales comparable to the horizon where approximations widely used currently may not hold; neglecting these effects may introduce biases in estimation of cosmological parameters as well as primordial non-Gaussianity.",1

Here, we consider an indirect measurement of large-scale polarization, using observed maps of small-scale polarization together with maps of fields that distort the CMB, such as CMB lensing and patchy reionization. We find that very futuristic CMB surveys will be able to reconstruct large-scale polarization, and thus the mean optical depth, using only measurements on small scales.",1

This requires finding the null geodesics which extend from the near-horizon region out to a distant observatory. In general these are given by elliptic integrals which are often studied numerically. In this paper, for the interesting special case of extremally spinning Kerr black holes, we use an emergent near-horizon conformal symmetry to find near-superradiant geodesics analytically in terms of elementary functions.",1
47124,2,"Steep Decay of GRB X-Ray Flares: The Results of Anisotropic Synchrotron Radiation When an emitting spherical shell with a constant Lorentz factor turns off emission abruptly at some radii, its high-latitude emission would obey the relation of $\hat{\alpha }$ (the temporal index) = $2+\hat{\beta }$ (the spectral index). However, this relation is violated by the X-ray fares in some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), whose $\hat{\alpha }$ is much more steeper. We show that the synchrotron radiation should be anisotropic when the angular distribution of accelerated electrons has a preferable orientation, and this anisotropy would naturally lead to a steeper decay for the high-latitude emission if the intrinsic emission is limb-brightened. We use this simple toy model to reproduce the temporal and spectral evolution of X-ray flares. We show that our model can well interpret the steep decay of the X-ray flares in the three GRBs selected as an example. Recent simulations on particle acceleration may support the specific anisotropic distribution of the electrons adopted in our work. Reversely, confirmation of the anisotropy in the radiation would provide meaningful clues to the details of electron acceleration in the emitting region.",1
47128,2,"On the Nature of Discrete Space-Time: The distance formula, relativistic time dilation and length contraction in discrete space-time In this work, the relativistic phenomena of Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and time dilation are derived using a modified distance formula that is appropriate for discrete space. This new distance formula is different than the Pythagorean theorem but converges to it for distances large relative to the Planck length. First, four candidate formulas developed by different people over the last 70 years will be discussed. Three of the formulas are shown to be identical for conditions that best describe discrete space. It is shown that this new distance formula is valid for all size-scales -- from the Planck length upwards -- and solves two major problems historically associated with the discrete space-time (DST) model. One problem it solves is the widely believed anisotropic nature of most discrete space models. Just as commonly believed is the second problem -- the incompatibility of DST's concept of an immutable atom of space and the length contraction of this atom required by special relativity. The new formula for distance in DST solves this problem. It is shown that length contraction of the atom of space does not occur for any relative velocity of two reference frames. It is also shown that time dilation of the atom of time does not occur. Also discussed is the possibility of any object being able to travel at the speed of light for specific temporal durations given by an equation derived in this work. Also discussed is a method to empirical verify the discreteness of space by studying any observed anomalies in the motion of astronomical bodies, such as differences in the bodies' inertial masses and gravitational masses. The importance of the new distance formula for causal set theory and other theories of quantum gravity is also discussed.",1

47300,2,"Duality relation among the Hamiltonian structures of a parametric coupled Korteweg-de Vries system We obtain the full Hamiltonian structure for a parametric coupled KdV system. The coupled system arises from four different real basic lagrangians. The associated Hamiltonian functionals and the corresponding Poisson structures follow from the geometry of a constrained phase space by using the Dirac approach for constrained systems. The overall algebraic structure for the system is given in terms of two pencils of Poisson structures with associated Hamiltonians depending on the parameter of the Poisson pencils. The algebraic construction we present admits the most general space of observables related to the coupled system. We then construct two master lagrangians for the coupled system whose field equations are the ε-parametric Gardner equations obtained from the coupled KdV system through a Gardner transformation. In the weak limit ε → 0 the lagrangians reduce to the ones of the coupled KdV system while, after a suitable redefinition of the fields, in the strong limit ε → ∞ we obtain the lagrangians of the coupled modified KdV system. The Hamiltonian structures of the coupled KdV system follow from the Hamiltonian structures of the master system by taking the two limits ε → 0 and ε → ∞.",1
47319,2,"Spherical collapse of dark matter haloes in tidal gravitational fields We study the spherical collapse model in the presence of external gravitational tidal shear fields for different dark energy scenarios and investigate the impact on the mass function and cluster number counts. While previous studies of the influence of shear and rotation on δ_c have been performed with heuristically motivated models, we try to avoid this model dependence and sample the external tidal shear values directly from the statistics of the underlying linearly evolved density field based on first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory. Within this self-consistent approach, in the sense that we restrict our treatment to scales where linear theory is still applicable, only fluctuations larger than the scale of the considered objects are included into the sampling process which naturally introduces a mass dependence of δ_c. We find that shear effects are predominant for smaller objects and at lower redshifts, i. e. the effect on δ_c is at or below the percent level for the ΛCDM model. For dark energy models we also find small but noticeable differences, similar to ΛCDM. The virial overdensity Δ_V is nearly unaffected by the external shear. The now mass dependent δ_c is used to evaluate the mass function for different dark energy scenarios and afterwards to predict cluster number counts, which indicate that ignoring the shear contribution can lead to biases of the order of 1σ in the estimation of cosmological parameters like Ω_m, σ_8 or w.",1

47348,2,"The $H_0$ tension in light of vacuum dynamics in the Universe Despite the outstanding achievements of modern cosmology, the classical dispute on the precise value of H0 , which is the first ever parameter of modern cosmology and one of the prime parameters in the field, still goes on and on after over half a century of measurements. Recently the dispute came to the spotlight with renewed strength owing to the significant tension (at >3σ c.l.) between the latest Planck determination obtained from the CMB anisotropies and the local (distance ladder) measurement from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), based on Cepheids. In this work, we investigate the impact of the running vacuum model (RVM) and related models on such a controversy. For the RVM, the vacuum energy density ρΛ carries a mild dependence on the cosmic expansion rate, i.e. ρΛ(H) , which allows to ameliorate the fit quality to the overall SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB cosmological observations as compared to the concordance ΛCDM model. By letting the RVM to deviate from the vacuum option, the equation of state w=−1 continues to be favored by the overall fit. Vacuum dynamics also predicts the following: i) the CMB range of values for H0 is more favored than the local ones, and ii) smaller values for σ8(0) . As a result, a better account for the LSS structure formation data is achieved as compared to the ΛCDM, which is based on a rigid (i.e. non-dynamical) Λ term.",1
47388,2,"Universality in cuprates: a gauge approach In high- $T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprates, many quantities exhibit a non-Fermi liquid universality hinting at a very peculiar structure of the underlying pairing mechanism for superconductivity: in this work, we focus on the universality for the in-plane resistivity and the superfluid density. We outline the previously developed spin–charge gauge approach to superconductivity in hole-doped cuprates: we decompose the hole of the $t-t'-J$ model for the $\mathrm {Cu}\mathrm {O}_2$ planes as the product of a spinful, chargeless gapped spinon and a spinless, charged holon with Fermi surface. Each one of these particle excitations is bound to a statistical gauge flux, allowing one to optimize their statistics. We show that this model allows for a natural interpretation of the universality: within this approach, under suitable conditions, the spinonic and holonic contributions to a response function sum up according to the Ioffe–Larkin rule. We argue that, if the spinonic contribution dominates, then one should expect strongly non-Fermi-liquid-like universality, due to the insensitivity of spinons to Fermi surface details. The in-plane resistivity and superfluid density are indeed dominated by spinons in the underdoped region. We theoretically derive these quantities, discussing their universal behaviours and comparing them with experimental data.",1

This waveform is the longest waveform obtained from fully general-relativistic simulations for NSNSs to date. Such long (and accurate) numerical waveforms are required to further improve semianalytical models used in gravitational wave data analysis, for example, the effective one body models.

We provide a set of consistency checks and compare our results to NSNS merger simulations with the independent bam code. We find agreement between them, which increases confidence in results obtained with either code.

47510,2,"How Problematic is the Near-Euclidean Spatial Geometry of the Large-Scale Universe? Modern observations based on general relativity indicate that the spatial geometry of the expanding, large-scale Universe is very nearly Euclidean. This basic empirical fact is at the core of the so-called ""flatness problem"", which is widely perceived to be a major outstanding problem of modern cosmology and as such forms one of the prime motivations behind inflationary models. An inspection of the literature and some further critical reflection however quickly reveals that the typical formulation of this putative problem is fraught with questionable arguments and misconceptions and that it is moreover imperative to distinguish between different varieties of problem. It is shown that the observational fact that the large-scale Universe is so nearly flat is ultimately no more puzzling than similar ""anthropic coincidences"", such as the specific (orders of magnitude of the) values of the gravitational and electromagnetic coupling constants. In particular, there is no fine-tuning problem in connection to flatness of the kind usually argued for. The arguments regarding flatness and particle horizons typically found in cosmological discourses in fact address a mere $single$ issue underlying the standard FLRW cosmologies, namely the $extreme$ improbability of these models with respect to any ""reasonable measure"" on the ""space of all spacetimes"". This issue may be expressed in different ways and a phase space formulation, due to Penrose, is presented here. A horizon problem only arises when additional assumptions - which are usually kept implicit and at any rate seem rather speculative - are made.",1

In studies of many-body classical chaos, it has been noted that one can define a velocity-dependent Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda({\bf v})$, which is the growth or decay rate along ""rays"" at that velocity. We examine the behavior of $\lambda({\bf v})$ for a variety of many-body systems, both chaotic and integrable. The so-called light cone for the spreading of operators is defined by $\lambda({\bf \hat n}v_B({\bf \hat n}))=0$, with a generally direction-dependent ""butterfly speed"" $v_B({\bf \hat n})$. In spatially local systems, $\lambda(v)$ is negative outside the light cone where it takes the form $\lambda(v) \sim -(v-v_B)^{\alpha}$ near $v_b$, with the exponent $\alpha$ taking on various values over the range of systems we examine.

47603,2,"Mitigating Complex Dust Foregrounds in Future Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Experiments Polarized Galactic foregrounds are one of the primary sources of systematic error in measurements of the B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Experiments are becoming increasingly sensitive to complexities in the foreground frequency spectra that are not captured by standard parametric models, potentially affecting our ability to efficiently separate out these components. Employing a suite of dust models encompassing a variety of physical effects, we simulate observations of a future seven-band CMB experiment to assess the impact of these complexities on parametric component separation. We identify configurations of frequency bands that minimize the “model errors” caused by fitting simple parametric models to more complex “true” foreground spectra, which bias the inferred CMB signal. We find that: (a) fits employing a simple two-parameter modified blackbody (MBB) dust model tend to produce significant bias in the recovered polarized CMB signal in the presence of physically realistic dust foregrounds; (b) generalized MBB models with three additional parameters reduce this bias in most cases, but non-negligible biases can remain, and can be hard to detect; (c) line-of-sight effects, which give rise to frequency decorrelation, and the presence of iron grains are the most problematic complexities in the dust emission for recovering the true CMB signal. More sophisticated simulations will be needed to demonstrate that future CMB experiments can successfully mitigate these more physically realistic dust foregrounds.",1
47627,2,"Gravastars with higher dimensional spacetimes We present a new model of gravastar in the higher dimensional Einsteinian spacetime including Einstein’s cosmological constant Λ . Following Mazur and Mottola (2001,  2004) we design the star with three specific regions, as follows: (I) Interior region, (II) Intermediate thin spherical shell and (III) Exterior region. The pressure within the interior region is equal to the negative matter density which provides a repulsive force over the shell. This thin shell is formed by ultra relativistic plasma, where the pressure is directly proportional to the matter-energy density which does counter balance the repulsive force from the interior whereas the exterior region is completely vacuum assumed to be de Sitter spacetime which can be described by the generalized Schwarzschild solution. With this specification we find out a set of exact non-singular and stable solutions of the gravastar which seems physically very interesting and reasonable.",1
47654,2,"Idealized Coil Cross-Sections with Minimized Conductor Area for High Field Dipoles In the design of superconducting accelerator magnets, the shape of the coil cross-section is mainly driven by the minimization of the conductor volume, constrained by requirements on the central magnetic field and its homogeneity. Such optimizations commonly assume either a Block or Cosine Theta coil type, which is then filled with (pre-determined) rectangular or key-stoned Rutherford cables. By optimizing the positions, angles and the number of turns, the field quality requirements and cost minimization are achieved. However, this leaves to wonder what the optimal coil geometry looks like, when such practical constraints are not present. Although such a coil cross-section has always been presented as the intersection between two ellipses, this method results in a non-circular aperture and is thus not fully representative of a realistic coil. This paper introduces a method in which organically shaped (non-graded) dipole coil layouts are optimized without any assumptions on the conductor. The resulting layouts are presented as a function of overall current density, aperture size and required magnetic field (inside the aperture). The layouts presented should be viewed as an ultimate limit of what can be achieved, for comparison with real coil layouts, and as an initial guide for finding an optimal cross-section for a realistic magnet.",1
47712,2,"The DAQ system for the AE$\bar g$IS experiment In the sociology of small- to mid-sized (O(100) collaborators) experiments the issue of data collection and storage is sometimes felt as a residual problem for which well-established solutions are known. Still, the DAQ system can be one of the few forces that drive towards the integration of otherwise loosely coupled detector systems. As such it may be hard to complete with off-the-shelf components only. LabVIEW and ROOT are the (only) two software systems that were assumed to be familiar enough to all collaborators of the AEḡIS (AD6) experiment at CERN: working out of the GXML representation of LabVIEW Data types, a semantically equivalent representation as ROOT TTrees was developed for permanent storage and analysis. All data in the experiment is cast into this common format and can be produced and consumed on both systems and transferred over TCP and/or multicast over UDP for immediate sharing over the experiment LAN. We describe the setup that has been able to cater to all run data logging and long term monitoring needs of the AEḡIS experiment so far.",1

48054,2,"Using Voids to Unscreen Modified Gravity The Vainshtein mechanism, present in many models of gravity, is very effective at screening dark matter haloes such that the fifth force is negligible and general relativity is recovered within their Vainshtein radii. Vainshtein screening is independent of halo mass and environment, in contrast to e.g. chameleon screening, making it difficult to test. However, our previous studies have found that the dark matter particles in filaments, walls, and voids are not screened by the Vainshtein mechanism. We therefore investigate whether cosmic voids, identified as local density minima using a watershed technique, can be used to test models of gravity that exhibit Vainshtein screening. We measure density, velocity, and screening profiles of stacked voids in cosmological N-body simulations using both dark matter particles and dark matter haloes as tracers of the density field. We find that the voids are completely unscreened, and the tangential velocity and velocity dispersion profiles of stacked voids show a clear deviation from Λ cold dark matter at all radii. Voids have the potential to provide a powerful test of gravity on cosmological scales.",1
48101,2,"Irreversible degradation of quantum coherence under relativistic motion We study the dynamics of quantum coherence under Unruh thermal noise and seek under which condition the coherence can be frozen in a relativistic setting. We find that the frozen condition is either (i) the initial state is prepared as an incoherence state or (ii) the detectors have no interaction with the external field. That is to say, the decoherence of the detectors' quantum state is irreversible under the influence of thermal noise induced by Unruh radiation. It is shown that quantum coherence approaches zero only in the limit of an infinite acceleration, while quantum entanglement could reduce to zero for a finite acceleration. It is also demonstrated that the robustness of quantum coherence is better than entanglement under the influence of the atom-field interaction for an extremely large acceleration. Therefore, quantum coherence is more robust than entanglement in an accelerating system and the coherence-type quantum resources are more accessible for relativistic quantum information processing tasks.",1
48182,2,"Limits of a spatial resolution of the cascaded GEM based detectors Spatial resolution of tracking detectors based on GEM cascades is determined in the simulation and measured. The simulation includes GEANT4 implemented transport of high energy electrons with careful accounting for atomic relaxation processes including emission of fluorescent photons and Auger electrons and custom post-processing taking into account diffusion, gas amplification fluctuations, the distribution of signals over readout electrodes, electronics noise and particular algorithm of final coordinate calculation (centre-of-gravity algorithm). The simulation demonstrates that the minimum of the spatial resolution of about 10–20 μm can be achieved with a gas mixture of Ar-CO(2) (75%–25%) at a strip pitch in the range from 250 μm to 300 μm. At a larger pitch the resolution quickly degrades reaching 70–100 μm at a pitch of 450–500 μm. The reasons of such behavior are discussed and corresponding hypothesis is tested. Particularly, the effect of electron cloud modification due to a GEM operation is considered using the ANSYS and Garfield++ simulation programs.

48312,2,"Quantum scattering in one-dimensional systems satisfying the minimal length uncertainty relation In quantum gravity theories, when the scattering energy is comparable to the Planck energy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle breaks down and is replaced by the minimal length uncertainty relation. In this paper, the consequences of the minimal length uncertainty relation on one-dimensional quantum scattering are studied using an approach involving a recently proposed second-order differential equation. An exact analytical expression for the tunneling probability through a locally-periodic rectangular potential barrier system is obtained. Results show that the existence of a non-zero minimal length uncertainty tends to shift the resonant tunneling energies to the positive direction. Scattering through a locally-periodic potential composed of double-rectangular potential barriers shows that the first band of resonant tunneling energies widens for minimal length cases when the double-rectangular potential barrier is symmetric but narrows down when the double-rectangular potential barrier is asymmetric. A numerical solution which exploits the use of Wronskians is used to calculate the transmission probabilities through the Pöschl–Teller well, Gaussian barrier, and double-Gaussian barrier. Results show that the probability of passage through the Pöschl–Teller well and Gaussian barrier is smaller in the minimal length cases compared to the non-minimal length case. For the double-Gaussian barrier, the probability of passage for energies that are more positive than the resonant tunneling energy is larger in the minimal length cases compared to the non-minimal length case. The approach is exact and applicable to many types of scattering potential.",1

The more we go deep into the knowledge of the dark component which embeds the stellar component of galaxies, the more we realize the profound interconnection between them. We show that the scaling laws among the structural properties of the dark and luminous matter in galaxies are too complex to derive from two inert components that just share the same gravitational field. In this paper we review the 30 years old paradigm of collisionless dark matter in galaxies. We found that their dynamical properties show strong indications that the dark and luminous components have interacted in a more direct way over a Hubble Time. The proofs for this are the presence of central cored regions with constant DM density in which their size is related with the disk lenghtscales. Moreover we find that the quantity $\rho_{DM}(r,L,R_D) \rho_\star (r,L,R_D)$ shows, in all objects, peculiarities very hardly explained in a collisionless DM scenario.",1
48490,2,"Étude des leptons taus et recherche de nouvelle physique avec le détecteur CMS Two data analyses are presented in this masters thesis. The rst one is a study of the
CMS Hadrons Plus Strips (HPS) algorithm, which reconstructs and identies tau leptons
that decay into a tau neutrino and one or more hadrons. Those are the so-called hadronic
taus (τh). The second analysis is a search for a new neutral massive resonance in the τ
+τ
−
decay channel, in the particular nal state τµτh where one of the tau leptons is a hadronic
tau and the other decays into a muon and two neutrinos. The data used in this thesis were
collected in the year 2015 by the CMS detector at the LHC collider. The data were collected
in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √
s = 13 TeV, and correspond to an
integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb−1
. The rst part of this thesis is motivated by the essential
role the HPS algorithm eciency plays in all CMS data analyses that study nal states
containing one or more hadronic taus, such as new physics searches in the τ
+τ
− channel
and the measure of the Standard Model scalar boson coupling to tau leptons. The study
of the tau lepton reconstruction and identication eciency is especially important because
this is the rst time it is done with high energy (√
s = 13 TeV) data and the new CMS
identication and reconstruction tools. The HPS algorithm eciency was rst determined
in the simulations, and the ratio r of the eciency in the data over the eciency in the
simulations was calculated, using the Z → τµτh/Z → µµ ratio method. This method determines
the value of r by a simultaneous ajustment of event yields in two data regions, one of
them rich in Z → τµτh events and the other rich in Z → µµ events. Three values of r were
calculated, one for each working point of the HPS algorithm. The values r = 0.929 ± 0.055,
r = 0.924 ± 0.058 and r = 0.911 ± 0.053 were found for, respectively, the loose, medium and
tight working points. The second analysis presented in this thesis is justied by the existence
of numerous new physics models which predict the existence of a new neutral massive
resonance. These models were built in order to solve some of the open problems left by the
Standard Model, such as the nature of the dark matter components and the unication of
gravity to the three other fundamental forces. The signal used as a reference in this second
analysis is the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) Z' boson. The τµτh invariant mass spectrum
was studied and no sign of new physics was found : the number of data events is in agreement
with Standard Model predictions. A statistical method was used in other to determine both
the expected and observed 95% condence limits for the SSM Z' boson mass, taking into
account the results obtained previously for the HPS algorithm eciency. The expected limit
is 1.37 ± 0.13 TeV, and the observed limit is 1.18 TeV.",1
48539,2,"WarmAndFuzzy: the halo model beyond CDM Cold dark matter (CDM) is a well established paradigm to describe cosmological structure formation, and works extraordinarily well on large, linear, scales. Progressing further in dark matter physics requires being able to understand structure formation in the non-linear regime, both for CDM and its alternatives. This short note describes a calculation, and accompanying code, WarmAndFuzzy, incorporating the popular models of warm and fuzzy dark matter (WDM and FDM) into the standard halo model to compute the non-linear matter power spectrum. The FDM halo model power spectrum has not been computed before. The FDM implementation models ultralight axions and other scalar fields with $m_a\approx 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$. The WDM implementation models thermal WDM with mass $m_X\approx 1\text{ keV}$. The halo model shows that differences between WDM, FDM, and CDM survive at low redshifts in the quasi-linear and fully non-linear regimes. The code uses analytic transfer functions for the linear power spectrum, modified collapse barriers in the halo mass function, and a modified concentration-mass relationship for the halo density profiles. Modified halo density profiles (for example, cores) are not included, but are under development. Cores are expected to have very minor effects on the power spectrum on observable scales. Applications of this code to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum and the cosmic microwave background lensing power spectrum will be discussed in companion papers. \textsc{WarmAndFuzzy} is available online at \url{https://github.com/DoddyPhysics/HMcode}, where collaboration in development is welcomed.",1
48582,2,"A parametrisation of modified gravity on nonlinear cosmological scales Viable modifications of gravity on cosmological scales predominantly rely on screening mechanisms to recover Einstein's Theory of General Relativity in the Solar System, where it has been well tested. A parametrisation of the effects of such modifications in the spherical collapse model is presented here for the use of modelling the modified nonlinear cosmological structure. The formalism allows an embedding of the different screening mechanisms operating in scalar-tensor theories through large values of the gravitational potential or its first or second derivatives as well as of linear suppression effects or more general transitions between modified and Einstein gravity limits. Each screening or suppression mechanism is parametrised by a time, mass, and environment dependent screening scale, an effective modified gravitational coupling in the fully unscreened limit that can be matched to linear theory, the exponent of a power-law radial profile of the screened coupling, determined by derivatives, symmetries, and potentials in the scalar field equation, and an interpolation rate between the screened and unscreened limits. Along with generalised perturbative methods, the parametrisation may be used to formulate a nonlinear extension to the linear parametrised post-Friedmannian framework to enable generalised tests of gravity with the wealth of observations from the nonlinear cosmological regime.",1

It is shown that depending on the driving source frequency, amplitude and direction, the kink behavior varies from attraction to repulsion (the negative and positive radiation pressure effects, respectively).

It is difficult for local probes to characterize QSL, whereas quantum entanglement can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool due to its non-locality. The kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model is one of the most studied and experimentally relevant models for QSL, but its solution remains under debate. Here, we perform a numerical Aharonov-Bohm experiment on this model and uncover universal features of the entanglement entropy. By means of the density-matrix renormalization group, we reveal the entanglement signatures of emergent Dirac spinons, which are the fractionalized excitations of the QSL. This scheme provides qualitative insights into the nature of kagome QSL, and can be used to study other quantum states of matter. As a concrete example, we also benchmark our methods on an interacting quantum critical point between a Dirac semimetal and a charge ordered phase.",1

48772,2,"Charged String Tensor Networks Tensor network methods provide an intuitive graphical language to describe quantum states, channels, open quantum systems and a class of numerical approximation methods that efficiently simulate certain many-body states in one spatial dimension. There are two fundamental types of tensor networks in wide use today. The most common is similar to quantum circuits. The second is the braided class of tensor networks, used in topological quantum computing. Recently a third class of tensor networks was discovered by Jaffe, Liu and Wozniakowski---the JLW-model---notably, the wires carry charge excitations. The rules in which network components can be moved, merged and manipulated in a graphical form of reasoning take an elegant form. For instance the relative charge locations on wires carries precise meaning and changing the ordering modifies a connected network specifically by a complex number.

48810,2,"Should Entanglement Measures be Monogamous or Faithful? “Is entanglement monogamous?” asks the title of a popular article [B. Terhal, IBM J. Res. Dev. 48, 71 (2004)], celebrating C. H. Bennett’s legacy on quantum information theory. While the answer is affirmative in the qualitative sense, the situation is less clear if monogamy is intended as a quantitative limitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a multipartite system, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we formalize what it takes for a bipartite measure of entanglement to obey a general quantitative monogamy relation on all quantum states. We then prove that an important class of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this general sense of the term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In particular, we show that every additive and suitably normalized entanglement measure cannot satisfy any nontrivial general monogamy relation while at the same time faithfully capturing the geometric entanglement structure of the fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy of such entanglement measures can be recovered if one allows for dimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples.",1

It gives a microscopic description of complex systems within the framework of modern concepts of nucleon- nucleon and manybody interactions. Using the muon capture process is an ideal tool to study few-nucleon systems. In this work we plan to investigate the μ +d ! n +n+n capture reaction. This reaction is interesting for several reasons. First of all, it offers a testing ground for the nuclear wave functions, which for any nucleon-nucleon (NN) forces can be constructed for such light systems with great accuracy. This reaction, is treated as the decay of the corresponding muonic atom, with the muon initially on the lowest K shell. The muon binding energy in this atom can be safely neglected and in the initial state we deal essentially with the deuteron and muon at rest. The general formalism for dealing with electroweak reactions on the deuteron will be presented.",1
48873,2,"Dynamical formation of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries in the field: an alternative to the common envelope Very wide binaries (>500 au) are subject to numerous encounters with fly-by stars in the Galactic field and can be perturbed into highly eccentric orbits (e ∼ 0.99). For such systems, the tidal interactions at close pericentre passages can lead to orbit circularization and, possibly, to mass transfer, consequently producing X-ray binaries without the need for the common envelope. We test this scenario for the case of black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) by performing a population synthesis with a numerical treatment of random stellar encounters. We test various models for the threshold pericentre distance under which the tidal forces cause circularization. We estimate that fly-by interactions can produce a current population of ∼60–220 BH LMXBs in the Galactic field. The results are sensitive to assumptions on the tidal circularization efficiency and the BH natal kick, because zero to very small kick velocities of several km s^−1 are required for the wide systems to survive the BH formation (∼60 per cent of the cases in our simulations). We show that the most likely donors are low-mass stars (<1 M_⊙; at the onset of mass transfer) as observed in the population of known sources (∼20). However, the low number of systems formed along this route is in contrast with the most recent observational estimate of the number of dormant BH LMXBs in the Galaxy 10^4–10^8. If, indeed, the numbers are so high, alternative formation channels of BHs with low-mass donors need to be identified.",1
49149,2,"Quantum gases of dipoles, quadrupoles and octupoles in Gross-Pitaevskii formalism with form factor Classical and quantum field theory of dipolar, axisymmetric quadrupolar and octupolar Bose gases is considered within a general approach. Dipole, axisymmetric quadrupole and octupole interaction potentials in the momentum representation are calculated. These results clearly demonstrate attraction and repulsion areas in corresponding gases. Then the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation, which plays a key role in the present paper, is derived from the corresponding functional. The zoology of the form factors appearing in GP equation is studied in details. The classes of proper for the description of spatially non-uniform condensates form factors are chosen. In the Thomas-Fermi approximation a general solution of the GP equation with a quasilocal form factor is obtained. This solution has an interesting form in terms of a double rapidly converging series that universally includes all the interactions considered. An important analysis of the condensate stability, in other words the study of condensate excitations, is also performed in this paper. In the Gaussian approximation (from the GP functional), a functional describing the perturbations of the condensate is derived in details. For a probe wave function in the form of a plane wave, a spectrum of Bogoliubov excitations was obtained, from which an equation describing the threshold momentum for the emergence of instability was derived. An important result of this paper is the dependence of the threshold on the momentum of a stationary condensate. For completeness of the presentation, the approximating expression in the form of a rapidly converging series is obtained for the corresponding dependence. Finally, in the conclusion a quantum hydrodynamic theory for dipolar, axisymmetric quadrupolar and octupolar gases is briefly presented, giving a clue to the experimental determination of the form factors.",1

49239,2,"Role of the Delta Resonance in the Population of Excited States in High-Energy Reactions The 54 Fe nucleus was populated from a 56 Fe beam with an energy of E / A =500 MeV. The internal decay of the 10 + metastable state via γ -ray emission was observed. The structure of this isomeric state has to involve at least four unpaired nucleons, therefore it cannot be populated in a simple two-neutron removal reaction from the ground state of 56 Fe, and we suggest that it was populated via the decay of the ∆ 0 resonance into a proton. This process allows the population of four- nucleon states, such as the observed isomer. Therefore, the population of the four-particle 10 + isomer in 54 Fe is a consequence of the quark structure of the nucleons. The possible use of this reaction mechanism for producing exotic nuclei is discussed.",1
49285,2,"Transparent lattice characterization with gated turn-by-turn data of diagnostic bunch train Methods of characterization of a storage ring’s lattice have traditionally been intrusive to routine operations. More importantly, the lattice seen by particles can drift with the beam current due to collective effects. To circumvent this, we have developed a novel approach for dynamically characterizing a storage ring’s lattice that is transparent to operations. Our approach adopts a dedicated filling pattern which has a short, separate diagnostic bunch train (DBT). Through the use of a bunch-by-bunch feedback system, the DBT can be selectively excited on demand. Gated functionality of a beam position monitor system is capable of collecting turn-by-turn data of the DBT, from which the lattice can then be characterized after excitation. As the DBT comprises only about one percent of the total operational bunches, the effects of its excitation are negligible to users. This approach allows us to localize the distributed quadrupolar wakefields generated in the storage ring vacuum chamber during beam accumulation. While effectively transparent to operations, our approach enables us to dynamically control the beta beat and phase beat, and unobtrusively optimize performance of the National Synchrotron Light Source-II accelerator during routine operations.",1
49294,2,"Tolman-Bondi-Lema\^itre spacetime with a generalised Chaplygin gas The Tolman-Bondi-Lema\^itre type of inhomogeneous spacetime with generalised Chaplygin gas equation of state given by $p = -\frac{A}{\rho^{\alpha}}$ is investigated where $ \alpha$ is a constant. We get an inhomogeneous spacetime at early stage but at the late stage of universe the inhomogeneity disappear with suitable radial co-ordinate transformation. For the large scale factor our model behaves like $\Lambda$CDM type which is in accord with the recent WMAP studies. We have calculated $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial r}$ and it is found to be negative for $\alpha > 0$ which is in agreement with the observational analysis. A striking difference with Chaplygin gas ($ \alpha = 1$) lies in the fact that with any suitable co-ordinate transformation our metric cannot be reduced to the Einstein-de Sitter type of homogeneous spacetime as is possible for the Chaplygin gas. We have also studied the effective deceleration parameter and find that the desired feature of \emph{flip} occurs at the late universe. It is seen that the flip time depends explicitly on $\alpha$. We also find that flip is not synchronous occurring earlier at the outer shells, thus offering a natural path against occurrence of wellknown shell crossing singularity. This is unlike the Tolman-Bondi case with perfect gas where one has to impose stringent external conditions to avoid this type of singularity. We further observe that if we adopt separation of variables method to solve the field equations the inhomogeneity in matter distribution disappears. The whole situation is later discussed with the help of Raychaudhury equation and the results compared with previous cases. This work is the generalisation of our previous article where we have taken $\alpha =1$.",1

49491,2,"Perversely categorified Lagrangian correspondences In this article, we construct a $2$-category of Lagrangians in a fixed shifted symplectic derived stack $\mathrm{S}$. The objects and morphisms are all given by Lagrangians living on various fiber products. A special case of this gives a $2$-category of $n$-shifted symplectic derived stacks $\mathsf{Symp}^n$. This is a $2$-category version of Weinstein’s symplectic category in the setting of derived symplectic geometry. We introduce another $-$category $\mathsf{Symp}$ or of $0$-shifted symplectic derived stacks where the objects and morphisms in $\mathsf{Symp}^0$ are enhanced with orientation data. Using this, we define a partially linearized $2$-category $\mathsf{LSymp}$. Joyce and his collaborators defined a certain perverse sheaf on any oriented $(-1)$-shifted symplectic derived stack. In $\mathsf{LSymp}$, the $2$-morphisms in $\mathsf{Symp}$ or are replaced by the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf assigned to the $(-1)$-shifted symplectic derived Lagrangian intersections. To define the compositions in $\mathsf{LSymp}$ we use a conjecture by Joyce, that Lagrangians in $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks define canonical elements in the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf over the Lagrangian. We refine and expand his conjecture and use it to construct $\mathsf{LSymp}$ and a $2$-functor from $\mathsf{Symp}$ or to $\mathsf{LSymp}$. We prove Joyce’s conjecture in the most general local model. Finally, we define a $2$-category of $d$-oriented derived stacks and fillings. Taking mapping stacks into an $n$-shifted symplectic stack defines a $2$-functor from this category to $\mathsf{Symp}^{n-d}$.",1

In this work, we construct spherically symmetric thin-shell charged gravastars model where the vacuum phase transition between the de Sitter interior and the external Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\text{o}}$m spacetime (RN) are matched at a junction surface, by using the cut-and-paste procedure. Gravastar solutions are found among the Guilfoyle exact solutions where the gravitational potential $W^2$ and the electric potential field $\phi$ obey a particularly relation in a simple form $ a\left(b-\epsilon \phi \right)^2 +b_1$, with $a,\,b$ and $b_1$ are arbitrary constants. The simplest ansatz of Guilfoyle's solution is implimented by the following assumption that the total energy density $8\pi \rho_m+\frac{Q^2}{ r^4}$ = constant, where $Q(r)$ is the electric charge up to a certain radius $r$. We show that, for certain ranges of the parameters, we can avoid the horizon formation which allow us to study the linearized spherically symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions.

49559,2,"Moments of inertia of neutron stars in relativistic mean field theory: the role of the isovector scalar channel With the inclusion of the isovector scalar channel in the meson-nucleon couplings, taking DD-ME$\delta$ as an effective interaction, the moments of inertia of neutron stars possessing various stellar masses are studied within the density dependent relativistic mean field (RMF) theory. The isovector scalar channel contributes to the softening of the neutron-star matter equation of state (EOS) and therefore the reduction of the maximum mass and radius of neutron stars. Smaller values of the total moment of inertia $I$ and the crustal moment of inertia $\Delta{I}$ are then obtained in DD-ME$\delta$ via numerical procedure in comparison with those in other selected RMF functionals. In addition, the involvement of the isovector scalar channel lowers the thickness of the neutron star crust and its mass fraction as well. The sensitivity to both the crustal mass and stellar radius causes the crustal moment of inertia to be more obviously reduced than the total one, eventually leading to a suppression on the fraction of crustal moment of inertia $\Delta{I}/I$ in DD-ME$\delta$. The results indicate the crustal moment of inertia as a more sensitive probe of the neutron-star matter EOS than the total one, and demonstrate that the isovector scalar meson-nucleon couplings in the RMF theory could exert influence over the physics of pulsar glitches.",1

I discuss the origin and role of anomalous chiral edge currents and of anomaly inflow in 2D insulators with explicitly or spontaneously broken time reversal, i.e. in Hall insulators and “Chern insulators”. The topological Chern–Simons action yielding the large-scale response equations for the 2D bulk of such states of matter is displayed.

Such beams were experimentally realized just a few years ago and are now used to probe various electromagnetic processes. So far, these experiments used the single vortex electron beams, either propagating in external fields or impacting a target. Here, we investigate the elastic scattering of two such aligned vortex electron beams and demonstrate that this process allows one to experimentally measure features which are impossible to detect in the usual plane-wave scattering. The scattering amplitude of this process is well approximated by two plane-wave scattering amplitudes with different momentum transfers, which interfere and give direct experimental access to the Coulomb phase. This phase (shift) affects the scattering of all charged particles and has thus received significant theoretical attention but was never probed experimentally. We show that a properly defined azimuthal asymmetry, which has no counterpart in plane-wave scattering, allows one to directly measure the Coulomb phase as function of the scattering angle.",1

50002,2,"Gravitational self-force on eccentric equatorial orbits around a Kerr black hole This paper presents the first calculation of the gravitational self-force on a small compact object on an eccentric equatorial orbit around a Kerr black hole to first order in the mass ratio. That is the pointwise correction to the object’s equations of motion (both conservative and dissipative) due to its own gravitational field, which is treated as a linear perturbation to the background Kerr spacetime generated by the much larger spinning black hole. The calculation builds on recent advances on constructing the local metric and self-force from solutions of the Teukolsky equation, which led to the calculation of the Detweiler-Barack-Sago redshift invariant on eccentric equatorial orbits around a Kerr black hole in a previous paper. After deriving the necessary expression to obtain the self-force from the Weyl scalar ψ4, we perform several consistency checks of the method and numerical implementation, including a check of the balance law relating the orbital average of the self-force to the average flux of energy and angular momentum out of the system. Particular attention is paid to the pointwise convergence properties of the sum over frequency modes in our method, identifying a systematic inherent loss of precision that any frequency domain calculation of the self-force on eccentric orbits must overcome.",1

Measurement of this polarization along with knowledge of the electron density of the objects allows a determination of the quadrupolar temperature anisotropy of the CMB as viewed from the space-time location of the objects. Maps of these remote temperature quadrupoles have several cosmological applications. Here we propose a new application: the reconstruction of the cosmological reionization history.

Furthermore, in some applications such as eddy current septum magnets a negative current is required as well. The presented topology allows the production of controlled half or full sine waves, with or without short or long flat-tops. The solution is able to regenerate back to the capacitor banks the energy from the magnet. To shape the desired current it is possible to time-shift the discharge of different Marx cells.

However, radiation damage in silicon strip is observed not only after extreme doses up to 1 GGy expected at E-XFEL, but also at doses in the range of tens of Gy, to which the detectors in laboratory instruments like X-ray diffractometers or X-ray spectrometers can be exposed. In this paper we report on investigation of radiation damage effects in a custom developed silicon strip detector used in laboratory diffractometers equipped with X-ray tubes. Our results show that significant degradation of detector performance occurs at low doses, well below 200 Gy, which can be reached during normal operation of laboratory instruments. Degradation of the detector energy resolution can be explained by increasing leakage current and increasing interstrip capacitance of the sensor. Another observed effect caused by accumulation of charge trapped in the surface oxide layer is change of charge division between adjacent strips.

50121,2,"Lattice Quantum Monte Carlo Study of Chiral Magnetic Effect in Dirac Semimetals In this paper Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in Dirac semimetals is studied by means of lattice Monte Carlo simulation. We measure conductivity of Dirac semimetals as a function of external magnetic field in parallel $\sigma_{\parallel}$ and perpendicular $\sigma_{\perp}$ to the external field directions. The simulations are carried out in three regimes: semimetal phase, onset of the insulator phase and deep in the insulator phase. In the semimetal phase $\sigma_{\parallel}$ grows whereas $\sigma_{\perp}$ drops with magnetic field. Similar behaviour was observed in the onset of the insulator phase but conductivity is smaller and its dependence on magnetic field is weaker. Finally in the insulator phase conductivities $\sigma_{\parallel, \perp}$ are close to zero and do not depend on magnetic field. In other words, we observe manifestation of the CME current in the semimetal phase, weaker manifestation of the CME in the onset of the insulator phase. We do not observe signatures of CME in the insulator phase. We believe that the suppression of the CME current in the insulator phase is connected to chiral symmetry breaking and generation of dynamical fermion mass which take place in this phase.",1
50148,2,"Hydrodynamical Neutron-star Kicks in Electron-capture Supernovae and Implications for the CRAB Supernova Neutron stars (NSs) obtain kicks of typically several 100 km/s at birth. The gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain these kicks as consequences of asymmetric mass ejection during the supernova (SN) explosion. Support for this hydrodynamic explanation is provided by observations of SN remnants with associated NSs, which confirm the prediction that the bulk of the explosion ejecta, in particular chemical elements between silicon and the iron group, are dominantly expelled in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of the NS kick. Here, we present a large set of two- and three-dimensional explosion simulations of electron-capture SNe, considering explosion energies between ~3x10^49 erg and ~1.6x10^50 erg. We find that the fast acceleration of the SN shock in the steep density gradient delimiting the O-Ne-Mg core of the progenitor enables such a rapid expansion of neutrino-heated matter that the growth of neutrino-driven convection freezes out quickly in a high-mode spherical harmonics pattern. Since the corresponding momentum asymmetry of the ejecta is very small and the gravitational acceleration by the fast-expanding ejecta abates rapidly, the NS kick velocities are at most a few km/s. The extremely low core compactness of O-Ne-Mg-core progenitors therefore favors hydrodynamic NS kicks much below the ~160 km/s measured for the Crab pulsar. This suggests either that the Crab Nebula is not the remnant of an electron-capture SN, but of a low-mass iron-core progenitor, or that the Crab pulsar was not accelerated by the gravitational tug-boat mechanism but received its kick by a non-hydrodynamic mechanism such as, e.g., anisotropic neutrino emission.",1

The boundary constraints are bounding chains, which are shown to behave like points. The interior constraints are arbitrary even degree classes in the cohomology of $X$ relative to $L.$ We show the invariants satisfy analogs of the axioms of closed Gromov-Witten theory. Our definition of invariants depends on the vanishing of a series of obstruction classes. One way to show vanishing is to impose certain cohomological conditions on $L.$ Alternatively, if there exists an anti-symplectic involution fixing $L$, then part of the obstructions vanish a priori, and weaker cohomological conditions suffice to guarantee vanishing of the remaining obstructions. In particular, our definition generalizes both Welschinger's and Georgieva's real enumerative invariants.",1

50219,2,"Optimal strategy for polarization modulation in the LSPE-SWIPE experiment Context. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode experiments are required to control systematic effects with an unprecedented level of accuracy. Polarization modulation by a half wave plate (HWP) is a powerful technique able to mitigate a large number of the instrumental systematics.Aims. Our goal is to optimize the polarization modulation strategy of the upcoming LSPE-SWIPE balloon-borne experiment, devoted to the accurate measurement of CMB polarization at large angular scales.Methods. We departed from the nominal LSPE-SWIPE modulation strategy (HWP stepped every 60 s with a telescope scanning at around 12 deg/s) and performed a thorough investigation of a wide range of possible HWP schemes (either in stepped or continuously spinning mode and at different azimuth telescope scan-speeds) in the frequency, map and angular power spectrum domain. In addition, we probed the effect of high-pass and band-pass filters of the data stream and explored the HWP response in the minimal case of one detector for one operation day (critical for the single-detector calibration process). We finally tested the modulation performance against typical HWP-induced systematics.Results. Our analysis shows that some stepped HWP schemes, either slowly rotating or combined with slow telescope modulations, represent poor choices. Moreover, our results point out that the nominal configuration may not be the most convenient choice. While a large class of spinning designs provides comparable results in terms of pixel angle coverage, map-making residuals and BB power spectrum standard deviations with respect to the nominal strategy, we find that some specific configurations (e.g., a rapidly spinning HWP with a slow gondola modulation) allow a more efficient polarization recovery in more general real-case situations.Conclusions. Although our simulations are specific to the LSPE-SWIPE mission, the general outcomes of our analysis can be easily generalized to other CMB polarization experiments.Key words: cosmic background radiation / methods: data analysis / methods: numerical",1

The gamma gravity model is a proposal which, unlike other viable f(R) models, not only changes the gravitational dynamics, but can in principle also have signatures at the background level that are different from those obtained in LambdaCDM (Cosmological constant, Cold Dark Matter). The aim of this paper is to study the nonlinear regime of the model in the case where, at late times, the background differs from LambdaCDM. We quantify the signatures produced on the power spectrum, the halo mass function, and the density and velocity profiles. To appreciate the features of the model, we have compared it to LambdaCDM and the Hu-Sawicki f(R) models. For the considered set of parameters we find that the screening mechanism is ineffective, which gives rise to deviations in the halo mass function that disagree with observations. This does not rule out the model per se, but requires choices of parameters such that | f_R0 | is much smaller, which would imply that its cosmic expansion history cannot be distinguished from LambdaCDM at the background level.",1

We show that elements of the mapping class group of a surface of genus g can be obtained through a sequence of topological charge projections along at least three mutually intersecting noncontractible cycles. We demonstrate this both through the algebraic theory of anyons and also through an analysis of the topology of the space-time manifold. We combine this result with two observations: (i) that surfaces of genus g can be effectively simulated in planar geometries by using bilayer, or doubled, versions of the topological phase of interest, and inducing the appropriate types of gapped boundaries; and (ii) that the required topological charge projections can be implemented as adiabatic unitary transformations by locally tuning microscopic parameters of the system, such as the energy gap. These observations suggest a possible path towards effectively implementing modular transformations in physical systems. In particular, they also show how the Ising ⊗Ising¯ state, in the presence of disconnected gapped boundaries, can support universal topological quantum computation.",1
50275,2,"A Brief Technical History of the Large-Area Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD) Collaboration The Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetector (LAPPD) Collaboration was formed in 2009 to develop large-area photodetectors capable of time resolutions measured in pico-seconds, with accompanying sub-millimeter spatial resolution. During the next three and one-half years the Collaboration developed the LAPPD design of 20 x 20 cm modules with gains greater than $10^7$ and non-uniformity less than $15\%$, time resolution less than 50 psec for single photons and spatial resolution of 700~microns in both lateral dimensions. We describe the R\&D performed to develop large-area micro-channel plate glass substrates, resistive and secondary-emitting coatings, large-area bialkali photocathodes, and RF-capable hermetic packaging. In addition, the Collaboration developed the necessary electronics for large systems capable of precise timing, built up from a custom low-power 15-GigaSample/sec waveform sampling 6-channel integrated circuit and supported by a two-level modular data acquisition system based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays for local control, data-sparcification, and triggering. We discuss the formation, organization, and technical successes and short-comings of the Collaboration. The Collaboration ended in December 2012 with a transition from R\&D to commercialization.",1

50351,2,"Correspondence between sonic points of ideal photon gas accretion and photon spheres In the accretion flow of a fluid, its velocity may transit from subsonic to supersonic. The point at which such a transition occurs is called the sonic point and is often mathematically special. We consider the steady-state and spherically symmetric accretion problem of an ideal photon gas in general static spherically symmetric spacetimes, neglecting backreaction. Our main result is that the equation of state (EOS) of an ideal photon gas leads to a correspondence between its sonic point and the photon sphere of the spacetime in general situations. Moreover, we also show that in spite of the dependence of the EOS on the dimension of spacetime, this correspondence holds for spacetimes of arbitrary dimensions.",1
50356,2,"Isotropy analyses of the Planck convergence map The presence of matter in the path of relic photons causes distortions in the angular pattern of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations, modifying their properties in a slight but measurable way. Recently, the Planck Collaboration released the estimated convergence map, an integrated measure of the large-scale matter distribution that produced the weak gravitational lensing (WL) phenomenon observed in Planck CMB data. We perform exhaustive analyses of this convergence map calculating the variance in small and large regions of the sky, but excluding the area masked due to Galactic contaminations, and compare them with the features expected in the set of simulated convergence maps, also released by the Planck Collaboration. Our goal is to search for sky directions or regions where the WL imprints anomalous signatures to the variance estimator revealed through a χ^2 analyses at a statistically significant level. In the local analysis of the Planck convergence map, we identified eight patches of the sky in disagreement, in more than 2σ, with what is observed in the average of the simulations. In contrast, in the large regions analysis we found no statistically significant discrepancies, but, interestingly, the regions with the highest χ^2 values are surrounding the ecliptic poles. Thus, our results show a good agreement with the features expected by the Λ cold dark matter concordance model, as given by the simulations. Yet, the outliers regions found here could suggest that the data still contain residual contamination, like noise, due to over- or underestimation of systematic effects in the simulation data set.",1

The aim of the magnet is to upgrade the superconducting cable test station at CERN with a Nb$_{3}$Sn dipole providing a 13-T magnetic field in a 100-mm aperture. The magnet is composed of four coils in a block-type configuration with flared ends, 1.6 m long, housed in a bladder, and key-type mechanical structure. A first assembly of the magnet, FRESCA2a, has been done at CERN at the end of 2016 with the four first Nb$_{3}$Sn coils fabricated at CEA Saclay and CERN. The coils were dimensionally measured, and tailored shims were fabricated and inserted in the coil pack to improve the contact between layers. In addition, tests with pressure sensitive films were carried out to verify the uniformity of the loading. The magnet was cold tested in February 2017 and dismounted to replace one coil. A second assembly, FRESCA2b, was produced and tested in August 2017. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of the various steps of the assembly from the impregnated coils to the delivery of the dipole to the test facility, with a particular emphasis on the procedures followed and the tooling developed.",1

The adopted theoretical model, valid for an arbitrary number of electromagnetic layers with parallel geometry, allows to calculate the quadrupole impedance for arbitrary values of the magnetic permeability μr.

This approach studies the interactions between optically polarized electron spins located inside a vapor cell of the SERF magnetometer and unpolarized or polarized particles of external solid-state objects. The coupling of spin-dependent interactions to the polarized electron spins of the magnetometer induces the tilt of the electron spins, which can be detected with high sensitivity by a probe laser beam similarly as an external magnetic field. We estimate that by moving unpolarized or polarized objects next to the SERF Rb vapor cell, the experimental limit to the spin-dependent interactions can be significantly improved over existing experiments, and new limits on the coupling strengths can be set in the interaction range below 10-2  m.",1
50647,2,"Quantum Information metric for time-dependent quantum systems and higher-order corrections It is well established that quantum criticality is one of the most intriguing phenomena which signals the presence of new states of matter. Without prior knowledge of the local order parameter, the quantum information metric (or fidelity susceptibility) can indicate the presence of a phase transition as well as it measures distance between quantum states. In this work, we calculate distance between quantum states which is equal to the fidelity susceptibility in quantum model for a time-dependent system describing a two-level atom coupled to a time-driven external field. As inspired by the Landau-Lifshitz quantum model, we find in the present work information metric induced by fidelity susceptibility. We for the first time derive a higher-order rank-3 tensor as third-order fidelity susceptibility. Having computed quantum noise function in this simple time-dependent model we show that the noise function eternally lasts long in our model.",1
50691,2,"Neutrino Fits In the first part of the talk I present the results of a global fit to neutrino
oscillation data fo-cusing on the standard three-flavour scenario. The
determination of all oscillation parameters is presented and I comment on the
status of the CP phase, for which current data indicates a preference of the
range π δCP 2π over 0 δCP π. Furthermore I discuss the issue of normal versus
inverted mass ordering which are degenerate at the 1σ level in our global fit. I
comment also on the possibility to use cosmological data to disfavour the
inverted mass ordering, arguing that using current data this is not significant.
In the last part I discuss the possible presence of non-standard neutrino
interactions. If new interaction of similar size as weak interactions are
allowed, the so-called LMA-dark solution appears. It corresponds to an exact
degeneracy in the neutrino evolution, which leads to a generalized mass ordering
degen-eracy and makes the determination of the neutrino mass ordering with
oscillation experiments impossible. The only way to break this degeneracy is by
using non-oscillation observables, for instance neutrino scattering data at low

A uniform linear distribution of charge is compatible with ellipsoidal equipotentials only for three-dimensions. In higher dimensions, the linear charge density giving rise to ellipsoidal equipotentials is counter-intuitive—the charge distribution has a maximum at the centre of the segment and vanishes at the ends of the segment. Only in two-dimensions is the continuous charge distribution intuitive—for that one case of ellipsoidal equipotentials, the charge is peaked at the ends of the segment and minimised at the centre.",1
50732,2,"Muon Creation in Supernova Matter Facilitates Neutrino-driven Explosions Muons can be created in nascent neutron stars (NSs) due to the high electron chemical potentials and the high temperatures. Because of their relatively lower abundance compared to electrons, their role has so far been ignored in numerical simulations of stellar core collapse and NS formation. However, the appearance of muons softens the NS equation of state, triggers faster NS contraction, and thus leads to higher luminosities and mean energies of the emitted neutrinos. This strengthens the postshock heating by neutrinos and can facilitate explosions by the neutrino-driven mechanism.",1
50775,2,"Analysis of Niobium Surface and Generated Particles in Vertical Electropolishing of Single-cell Coupon Cavity In our previous studies, we have reported parameter investigation for vertical electropolishing (VEP) of 1-cell niobium (Nb) tesla/ILC type cavities using a Ninja cathode. A 1-cell coupon cavity containing six Nb disk coupons at its different positions was found effective to reduce time and cost to establish an optimized VEP recipe. In this work, we present surface analyses of VEPed Nb coupon surfaces using scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Surfaces contained micro- and nano-sized particles which were found with random distributions and different number densities on the beam pipe and iris coupons. Surfaces of equator coupons were found to have relatively less number of particles or almost clean. To analyze particles, a few particles were picked-up from a coupon surface using a tungsten tip under SEM and analyzed with EDX while the coupon was moved out from the SEM chamber to avoid its effect in EDX spectra. The particles were confirmed as oxygen-rich niobium and contained fluorine and carbon also. XPS analysis of the coupon surfaces was also carried out for further study of surface chemistry.",1

This issue becomes particularly critical for the electronics built as ASICs implemented in a modern CMOS technology, for which the breakdown voltages are in the range of a few Volts, while the discharges may result in voltage spikes of even thousands Volts. The paper presents test results of input protection structures integrated with a specific design of the front-end electronics manufactured in the 350 nm CMOS process. The structures were tested using an electrical circuit to mimic discharges in the detectors for different voltage and current parameters of the sparks. Accomplished measurements showed no degradation in the front-end electronics performance even after very excessive discharge tests.",1
51028,2,"Gravitationally induced quantum transitions In this paper, we calculate the probability for resonantly inducing transitions in quantum states due to time-dependent gravitational perturbations. Contrary to common wisdom, the probability of inducing transitions is not infinitesimally small. We consider a system of ultracold neutrons, which are organized according to the energy levels of the Schrödinger equation in the presence of the Earth’s gravitational field. Transitions between energy levels are induced by an oscillating driving force of frequency ω. The driving force is created by oscillating a macroscopic mass in the neighborhood of the system of neutrons. The neutron lifetime is approximately 880 sec while the probability of transitions increases as t2. Hence, the optimal strategy is to drive the system for two lifetimes. The transition amplitude then is of the order of 1.06×10-5, and hence with a million ultracold neutrons, one should be able to observe transitions.",1
51031,2,"On asymptotics and resurgent structures of enumerative Gromov–Witten invariants Making use of large-order techniques in asymptotics and resurgent analysis, this work addresses the growth of enumerative Gromov–Witten invariants—in their dependence upon genus and degree of the embedded curve—for several different threefold Calabi–Yau varieties. In particular, while the leading asymptotics of these invariants at large genus or at large degree is exponential, at combined large genus and degree it turns out to be factorial. This factorial growth has a resurgent nature, originating via mirror symmetry from the resurgent-transseries description of the B-model free energy. This implies the existence of nonperturbative sectors controlling the asymptotics of the Gromov–Witten invariants, which could themselves have an enumerative-geometry interpretation. The examples addressed include: the resolved conifold; the local surfaces local $\mathbb{P}^2$ and local $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$; the local curves and Hurwitz theory; and the compact quintic. All examples suggest very rich interplays between resurgent asymptotics and enumerative problems in algebraic geometry.",1
51089,2,"Implications of solar wind measurements for solar models and composition We critically examine recent claims of a high solar metallicity by von Steiger & Zurbuchen (2016, vSZ16) based on in situ measurements of the solar wind, rather than the standard spectroscopically inferred abundances (Asplund et al. 2009, hereafter AGSS09). We test the claim by Vagnozzi et al. (2016) that a composition based on the solar wind enables one to construct a standard solar model in agreement with helioseismological observations and thus solve the decades-old solar modelling problem. We show that, although some helioseismological observables are improved compared to models computed with spectroscopic abundances, most are in fact worse. The high abundance of refractory elements leads to an overproduction of neutrinos, with a predicted ^8B flux that is nearly twice its observed value, and ^7Be and CNO fluxes that are experimentally ruled out at high confidence. A combined likelihood analysis shows that models using the vSZ16 abundances are worse than AGSS09 despite a higher metallicity. We also present astrophysical and spectroscopic arguments showing the vSZ16 composition to be an implausible representation of the solar interior, identifying the first ionization potential effect in the outer solar atmosphere and wind as the likely culprit.",1
51145,2,"Mass decomposition of SLACS lens galaxies in Weyl conformal gravity We study here, using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution of Weyl conformal theory, the mass decomposition in the representative subsample of 57 early-type elliptical lens galaxies of the Sloan Lens Advanced Camera for Surveys (SLACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We begin by showing that the solution need not be an exclusive solution of conformal gravity but can also be viewed as a solution of a class of f(R) gravity theories coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics thereby rendering the ensuing results more universal. Since lensing involves light bending, we shall first show that the solution adds to Schwarzschild light bending caused by the luminous mass (M*) a positive contribution +γR contrary to the previous results in the literature, thereby resolving a long-standing problem. The cause of the error is critically examined. Next, applying the expressions for light bending together with an input equating Einstein and Weyl angles, we develop a novel algorithm for separating the luminous component from the total lens mass (luminous+dark) within the Einstein radius. Our results indicate that the luminous mass estimates differ from the observed total lens masses by a linear proportionality factor across the subsample, which qualitatively agrees with the common conclusion from a number of different simulations in the literature. In quantitative detail, we observe that the ratios of luminous over total lens mass (f*) within the Einstein radius of individual galaxies take on values near unity, many of which remarkably fall inside or just marginally outside the specified error bars obtained from a simulation based on the Bruzual-Charlot stellar population synthesis model together with the Salpeter initial mass function favored on the ground of metallicity [Grillo et al., Astron. Astrophys. 501, 461 (2009)]. We shall also calculate the average dark matter density ⟨ρ⟩av of individual galaxies within their respective Einstein spheres. To our knowledge, the present approach, being truly analytic, seems to be the first of its kind attempting to provide a new decomposition scheme distinct from the simulational ones.",1
51218,2,"Study of the breakdown voltage of SiPMs The breakdown behaviour of SiPMs (Silicon PhotoMultiplier) with pixel sizes of 15×15,25×25,50×50 , and 100×100μm2 , manufactured by KETEK, has been investigated. From the current–voltage characteristics measured with and without illumination by LED light of 470 nm wavelength, the current-breakdown voltage , V I , and from linear fits of the voltage dependence of the SiPM gain, measured by recording pulse-area spectra, the gain-breakdown voltage , V G , have been obtained. The voltage dependence of the Geiger-breakdown probability was determined from the fraction of zero photoelectron events with LED illumination. By comparing the results to a model calculation, the photodetection-breakdown voltage , V PD , has been determined. Within experimental uncertainties, V I and V PD are equal and independent of pixel size. For V G , a dependence on pixel size is observed. The difference VI−VG is about 1 V for the SiPM with 15μm pixels, decreases with pixel size and is compatible with zero for the SiPM with 100 μm pixels.",1

The Einstein-Maxwell field equations are solved together with the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for $ f(R,T)=R+2\lambda T$ where $ \lambda$ is the coupling constant, also called model parameter. We discuss different features of such configurations (like pressure, mass and charge) using graphical behavior for two values of $ \sigma$ . It is found that the effects of model parameter $ \lambda$ on different quantities remain the same for both cases. The energy conditions are satisfied and stellar configurations are stable in each case.",1

51465,2,"Phase-Space Berry Phases in Chiral Magnets Skyrmion Charge, Hall Effect, and Dynamics of Magnetic Skyrmions The dynamics of electrons in solids is influenced by Berry phases in phase space (com- bined position and momentum space). Phase-space Berry phases lead to an effective force on the electrons, an anomalous contribution to the group velocity, and a correction to the density of states in phase space. In addition, Berry phases in position and in momentum space are related to topological winding numbers and can be used to char- acterize topologically distinct phases of matter. We study theoretically the effects of phase-space Berry phases in magnetic materials with weak spin-orbit coupling and a smoothly varying magnetization texture. Such magnetic textures appear generically in non-centrosymmetric magnetic materials with weak spin-orbit coupling due to a com- petition between the ferromagnetic exchange interaction and the weaker Dzyaloshinskii- Moriya interaction. In particular, the discovery of topologically stable whirls, so-called skyrmions, in the magnetization texture of these materials has attracted considerable attention due to prospects of applications in future magnetic storage devices. In part I of this thesis, we investigate the influence of phase-space Berry phases on the equilibrium properties of electrons in chiral magnets with weak spin-orbit coupling. We show that the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the long-wavelength limit can be calculated from Berry phases in mixed position/momentum space and that the same Berry phases lead to an electric charge of skyrmions in metallic chiral magnets. In insulators, the skyrmion charge of magnetic skyrmions turns out to be proportional to the topologically quantized second Chern number in phase space. This establishes a link between skyrmions in chiral magnets and the charged excitations in integer quantum Hall systems with small Zeeman splitting. In part II, we consider the Hall effect in the skyrmion lattice phase of chiral magnets in presence of spin-orbit coupling. It has been previously known that Berry phases in momentum space lead to the intrinsic part of the anomalous Hall effect, and that Berry phases in position space lead to an effective Lorentz force, resulting in the so-called topological Hall effect. By expanding the Kubo-Stˇreda Formula for the Hall conductivity in gradients in position and momentum space, we show that the interplay between smooth magnetic textures and spin-orbit coupling leads to a previously disregarded contribution to the Hall effect, and we find a correction to the semiclassical formulation of the topological Hall effect. In part III, we study the influence of phase-space Berry phases on the dynamics of skyrmions in chiral magnets. Berry phases in mixed position/momentum space lead to a dissipationless momentum transfer from conduction electrons to skyrmions that is proportional to an applied electric field and independent of the (spin or electric) current. We further show that the electric charge of skyrmions, discussed in part I, influences the skyrmion motion only via hydrodynamic drag and ohmic friction in metals. In insulators, the quantized skyrmion charge couples directly to an applied electric field.",1
51477,2,"Probing the nuclear symmetry energy at high densities with nuclear reactions he nuclear equation of state is a topic of highest current interest in nuclear structure and reactions as well as in astrophysics. The symmetry en- ergy is the part of the equation of state which is connected to the asymmetry in the neutron/proton content. During recent years a multitude of experimental and theoretical efforts on different fields have been undertaken to constraint its density dependence at low densities but also above saturation density ( ρ 0 =0 . 16 fm − 3 ). Conventionally the symmetry energy is described by its magnitude S v and the slope parameter L , both at saturation density. Values of L = 44–66 MeV and S v =31– 33 MeV have been deduced in recent compilations of nuclear structure, heavy-ion reaction and astrophysics data. Apart from astrophysical data on mass and radii of neutron stars, heavy-ion reactions at incident energies of several 100 MeV are the only means do access the high density behaviour of the symmetry energy. In par- ticular, meson production and collective flows upto about 1 A GeV are predicted to be sensitive to the slope of the symmetry energy as a function of density. From the measurement of elliptic flow of neutrons with respect to charged particles at GSI, a more stringent constraint for the slope of the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities has been deduced. Future options to reach even higher densities will be discussed.",1
51532,2,"Dynamics of quantum causal structures It was recently suggested that causal structures are both dynamical, because of general relativity, and indefinite, because of quantum theory. The process matrix formalism furnishes a framework for quantum mechanics on indefinite causal structures, where the order between operations of local laboratories is not definite (e.g., one cannot say whether operation in laboratory A occurs before or after operation in laboratory B). Here, we develop a framework for “dynamics of causal structures,” i.e., for transformations of process matrices into process matrices. We show that, under continuous and reversible transformations, the causal order between operations is always preserved. However, the causal order between a subset of operations can be changed under continuous yet nonreversible transformations. An explicit example is that of the quantum switch, where a party in the past affects the causal order of operations of future parties, leading to a transition from a channel from A to B, via superposition of causal orders, to a channel from B to A. We generalize our framework to construct a hierarchy of quantum maps based on transformations of process matrices and transformations thereof.",1

51552,2,"One network metric datastore to track them all: the OSG network metric service The Open Science Grid (OSG) relies upon the network as a critical part of the distributed infrastructures it enables. In 2012, OSG added a new focus area in networking with a goal of becoming the primary source of network information for its members and collaborators. This includes gathering, organizing, and providing network metrics to guarantee effective network usage and prompt detection and resolution of any network issues, including connection failures, congestion, and traffic routing. In September of 2015, this service was deployed into the OSG production environment. We will report on the creation, implementation, testing, and deployment of the OSG Networking Service. Starting from organizing the deployment of perfSONAR toolkits within OSG and its partners, to the challenges of orchestrating regular testing between sites, to reliably gathering the resulting network metrics and making them available for users, virtual organizations, and higher level services, all aspects of implementation will be reviewed. In particular, several higher-level services were developed to bring the OSG network service to its full potential. These include a web-based mesh configuration system, which allows central scheduling and management of all the network tests performed by the instances; a set of probes to continually gather metrics from the remote instances and publish it to different sources; a central network datastore (esmond), which provides interfaces to access the network monitoring information in close to real time and historically (up to a year) giving the state of the tests; and a perfSONAR infrastructure monitor system, ensuring the current perfSONAR instances are correctly configured and operating as intended. We will also describe the challenges we encountered in ongoing operations of the network service and how we have evolved our procedures to address those challenges. Finally we will describe our plans for future extensions and improvements to the service.",1
51715,2,"A galaxy lacking dark matter Studies of galaxy surveys in the context of the cold dark matter paradigm have shown that the mass of the dark matter halo and the total stellar mass are coupled through a function that varies smoothly with mass. Their average ratio M_{halo}/M_{stars} has a minimum of about 30 for galaxies with stellar masses near that of the Milky Way (approximately 5x10^{10} solar masses) and increases both towards lower masses and towards higher masses. The scatter in this relation is not well known; it is generally thought to be less than a factor of two for massive galaxies but much larger for dwarf galaxies. Here we report the radial velocities of ten luminous globular-cluster-like objects in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2, which has a stellar mass of approximately 2x10^8 solar masses. We infer that its velocity dispersion is less than 10.5 kilometers per second with 90 per cent confidence, and we determine from this that its total mass within a radius of 7.6 kiloparsecs is less than 3.4x10^8 solar masses. This implies that the ratio M_{halo}/M_{stars} is of order unity (and consistent with zero), a factor of at least 400 lower than expected. NGC1052-DF2 demonstrates that dark matter is not always coupled with baryonic matter on galactic scales.",1
51762,2,"First-order strong-field QED processes in a tightly focused laser beam In a previous article [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 213201 (2016)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.117.213201] we have determined the angular resolved and the total energy spectrum of a positron produced via nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production by a high-energy photon counterpropagating with respect to a tightly focused laser beam. Here, we first generalize the results in that article by including the possibility that the incoming photon is not exactly counterpropagating with respect to the laser field. As main focus of the present paper, we determine the photon angular resolved and total energy spectrum for the related process of nonlinear Compton scattering by an electron impinging into a tightly focused laser beam.

The crossing symmetry relation between the two processes in a tightly focused laser beam is also elucidated.",1
51765,2,"The $^{12}$C(α,γ)$^{16}$O reaction and its implications for stellar helium burning The creation of carbon and oxygen in our Universe is one of the forefront questions in nuclear astrophysics. The determination of the abundance of these elements is key to our understanding of both the formation of life on Earth and to the life cycles of stars. While nearly all models of different nucleosynthesis environments are affected by the production of carbon and oxygen, a key ingredient, the precise determination of the reaction rate of C12(α,γ)O16, has long remained elusive. This is owed to the reaction’s inaccessibility, both experimentally and theoretically. Nuclear theory has struggled to calculate this reaction rate because the cross section is produced through different underlying nuclear mechanisms. Isospin selection rules suppress the E1 component of the ground state cross section, creating a unique situation where the E1 and E2 contributions are of nearly equal amplitudes. Experimentally there have also been great challenges. Measurements have been pushed to the limits of state-of-the-art techniques, often developed for just these measurements. The data have been plagued by uncharacterized uncertainties, often the result of the novel measurement techniques that have made the different results challenging to reconcile. However, the situation has markedly improved in recent years, and the desired level of uncertainty ≈10% may be in sight. In this review the current understanding of this critical reaction is summarized. The emphasis is placed primarily on the experimental work and interpretation of the reaction data, but discussions of the theory and astrophysics are also pursued. The main goal is to summarize and clarify the current understanding of the reaction and then point the way forward to an improved determination of the reaction rate.",1
51801,2,"Experimental Studies of Beam Collimation System in the Fermilab Booster A two-stage collimation (2SC) system was installed in Fermilab Booster around 2004 and consists of 2 primary collimators (PrC), one for each of the horizontal and vertical planes and 3 secondary collimators (SC) each capable of acting in both planes. Presently, only SC are used as the single-stage collimation (1SC). Part of the Fermilab Proton Improvement Plan (PIP) includes a task to test 2SC for Booster operations. In this paper we describe preparatory steps to fix SC motion issues and installation of a 380μm thick aluminum foil PrC and post-processing software for beam orbit and beam loss measurements. The initial experimental results for 2SC in the vertical plane are also presented. The tuning of 2SC system was performed using fast loss monitors allowing much higher time-resolution than existing BLMs. Analysis of losses and beam transmission efficiency allow for the comparison of 1SC and 2SC schemes.",1

They are capable of very high current densities in intense applied magnetic field, have a very high thermal stability, can withstand high transverse pressures and allow operation in 20–30 K helium gas flow, potentially reducing operating cost significantly. During the EuCARD2 program, significant developments have been made in terms of coil design, manufacturing, and testing. Now that EuCARD2 has come to an end, CERN and collaborators are initiating a new program to continue the development of HTS accelerator magnets. This paper presents our initial thoughts on the conceptual design of a 20 T+ accelerator magnet, using the results and technologies from EuCARD2 combined with some new ideas. The paper discusses the options available for the cross-sectional layout, the use of a hybrid configurations, including Aligned Block, the design of the coil-ends and dual aperture configurations. Also, discussed is the quench protection of the magnets. Due to the high thermal stability of the conductor and high energy densities, it will be required to explore an entirely a new approach.",1
51991,2,"Focussing effects in laser-electron Thomson scattering We study the effects of laser pulse focusing on the spectral properties of Thomson scattered radiation. Modeling the laser as a paraxial beam we find that, in all but the most extreme cases of focusing, the temporal envelope has a much bigger effect on the spectrum than the focusing itself. For the case of ultrashort pulses, where the paraxial model is no longer valid, we adopt a subcycle vector beam description of the field. It is found that the emission harmonics are blue shifted and broaden out in frequency space as the pulse becomes shorter. Additionally the carrier envelope phase becomes important, resulting in an angular asymmetry in the spectrum. We then use the same model to study the effects of focusing beyond the limit where the paraxial expansion is valid. It is found that fields focussed to subwavelength spot sizes produce spectra that are qualitatively similar to those from subcycle pulses due to the shortening of the pulse with focusing. Finally, we study high-intensity fields and find that, in general, the focusing makes negligible difference to the spectra in the regime of radiation reaction.",1

The ratio of elliptic flow of neutrons with respect to that of the light charged particles was used as main experimental observable to probe the density dependence of the symmetry energy term of the nuclear equation of state.

In order to extract the most reliable range of uncertainty from theory, we employ models based upon the Skyrme force and density functional theory and select models that are consistent with empirical data of finite nuclei, measured properties of nuclear matter around the saturation density, and observation of the maximum mass of neutron stars. From the selected models, we calculate the Love number $k_2$, dimensionless tidal deformability $\Lambda$, and mass-weighted deformability $\tilde{\Lambda}$ in the binary system. We find that all the models considered in this work give $\tilde{\Lambda}$ less than 800 which is the upper limit obtained from the measurement of GW170817. However, the model dependence of tidal deformability is manifest such that our results on the tidal deformability exhibit critical sensitivity to the size of neutron stars.",1

To provide small transverse size of the electron beam and small transverse beam divergence in the undulator, permanent quadrupole magnets with high gradient of the magnetic field up to 510 T/m are used in the electron beam line. In frame of this report we present main features of the designed electron beam line. 3D modeling of the magnetic field in the quadrupole magnets has been performed. Effects of the chromatic and spherical aberrations are taken into consideration. The electron beam dynamic is studied by using symplectic integration though the 3D field maps of the permanent quadrupole magnets.

The apparatus is a prototype of the magnetic components for a neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) search, which will take place at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory using ultra-cold neutrons (UCN). That search requires a uniform magnetic field to mitigate systematic effects and obtain long polarization lifetimes for neutron spin precession measurements.

In this paper, we construct a one-to-one correspondence between those holomorphic vector bundles and a certain kind of projectively flat bundles explicitly, by using the result of the classification of factors of automorphy of projectively flat bundles on complex tori. Furthermore, we give a geometric interpretation of the exact triangles consisting of projectively flat bundles on complex tori by focusing on the dimension of intersections of the corresponding affine Lagrangian submanifolds.",1
52055,2,"Gamma-ray Showers Observed at Ground Level in Coincidence With Downward Lightning Leaders Bursts of gamma ray showers have been observed in coincidence with downward propagating negative leaders in lightning flashes by the Telescope Array Surface Detector (TASD). The TASD is a 700~square kilometer cosmic ray observatory located in southwestern Utah, U.S.A. In data collected between 2014 and 2016, correlated observations showing the structure and temporal development of three shower-producing flashes were obtained with a 3D lightning mapping array, and electric field change measurements were obtained for an additional seven flashes, in both cases co-located with the TASD. National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) information was also used throughout. The showers arrived in a sequence of 2--5 short-duration ($\le$10~$\mu$s) bursts over time intervals of several hundred microseconds, and originated at an altitude of $\simeq$3--5 kilometers above ground level during the first 1--2 ms of downward negative leader breakdown at the beginning of cloud-to-ground lightning flashes. The shower footprints, associated waveforms and the effect of atmospheric propagation indicate that the showers consist primarily of downward-beamed gamma radiation. This has been supported by GEANT simulation studies, which indicate primary source fluxes of $\simeq$$10^{12}$--$10^{14}$ photons for $16^{\circ}$ half-angle beams. We conclude that the showers are terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), similar to those observed by satellites, but that the ground-based observations are more representative of the temporal source activity and are also more sensitive than satellite observations, which detect only the most powerful TGFs.",1

Corresponding results are strongly corroborated by numeric calculations. It is shown that in the system there exist four different edge phases if the number of sites is odd, and eight edges phases if the chain comprises even number of sites. Phases are labelled by σ_1 ≡ sgn(t_1t_3 − t_2t_4), σ_2 ≡ sgn(t_1t_4 − t_2t_3), and σ_3 ≡ sgn(t_1t_2 − t_3t_4).

52219,2,"Low Mass X-Ray Binaries in the Inner Galaxy: Implications for Millisecond Pulsars and the GeV Excess If millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are responsible for the excess gamma-ray emission observed from the region surrounding the Galactic Center, the same region should also contain a large population of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this study, we compile and utilize a sizable catalog of LMXBs observed in the the Milky Way's globular cluster system and in the Inner Galaxy, as well as the gamma-ray emission observed from globular clusters, to estimate the flux of gamma rays predicted from MSPs in the Inner Galaxy. From this comparison, we conclude that only up to ~ 4-23% of the observed gamma-ray excess is likely to originate from MSPs. This result is consistent with, and more robust than, previous estimates which utilized smaller samples of both globular clusters and LMXBs. If MSPs had been responsible for the entirety of the observed excess, INTEGRAL should have detected ~ 10(3) LMXBs from within a 10(o) radius around the Galactic Center, whereas only 42 LMXBs (and 46 additional LMXB candidates) have been observed.",1

The cosmological dynamics of spatially homogeneous but anisotropic Bianchi type-III space-time is investigated in presence of a perfect fluid within the framework of Hu–Sawicki model. We use the dynamical system approach to perform a detailed analysis of the cosmological behaviour of this model for the model parameters $n=1, c_1=1$ , determining all the fixed points, their stability and corresponding cosmological evolution. We have found stable fixed points with de Sitter solution along with unstable radiation like fixed points. We have identified a matter like point which act like an unstable spiral and when the initial conditions of a trajectory are very close to this point, it stabilizes at a stable accelerating point. Thus, in this model, the universe can naturally approach to a phase of accelerated expansion following a radiation or a matter dominated phase. It is also found that the isotropisation of this model is affected by the spatial curvature and that all the isotropic fixed points are found to be spatially flat.",1

52409,2,"Magnetic shielding and exotic spin-dependent interactions Experiments searching for exotic spin-dependent interactions typically employ magnetic shielding between the source of the exotic field and the interrogated spins. We explore the question of what effect magnetic shielding has on detectable signals induced by exotic fields. Our general conclusion is that for common experimental geometries and conditions, magnetic shields should not significantly reduce sensitivity to exotic spin-dependent interactions, especially when the technique of comagnetometry is used. However, exotic fields that couple to electron spin can induce magnetic fields in the interior of shields made of a soft ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material. This induced magnetic field must be taken into account in the interpretation of experiments searching for new spin-dependent interactions and raises the possibility of using a flux concentrator inside magnetic shields to amplify exotic spin-dependent signals.",1

52435,2,"Beating the standard sensitivity-bandwidth limit of cavity-enhanced interferometers with internal squeezed-light generation The shot-noise limited peak sensitivity of cavity-enhanced interferometric measurement devices, such as gravitational-wave detectors, can be improved by increasing the cavity finesse, even when comparing fixed intracavity light powers. For a fixed light power inside the detector, this comes at the price of a proportional reduction in the detection bandwidth. High sensitivity over a large span of signal frequencies, however, is essential for astronomical observations. It is possible to overcome this standard sensitivity-bandwidth limit using nonclassical correlations in the light field. Here, we investigate the internal squeezing approach, where the parametric amplification process creates a nonclassical correlation directly inside the interferometer cavity. We theoretically analyze the limits of the approach and measure 36% increase in the sensitivity-bandwidth product compared to the classical case. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of an improvement in the sensitivity-bandwidth product using internal squeezing, opening the way for a new class of optomechanical force sensing devices.",1
52497,2,"Definitive test of the Rh = ct universe using redshift drift The redshift drift of objects moving in the Hubble flow has been proposed as a powerful model-independent probe of the underlying cosmology. A measurement of the first- and second-order redshift derivatives appears to be well within the reach of upcoming surveys using as the Extremely Large Telescope high resolution spectrometer (ELT-HIRES) and the Square Kilometer Phase 2 Array (SKA). Here we show that an unambiguous prediction of the R_h = ct cosmology is zero drift at all redshifts, contrasting sharply with all other models in which the expansion rate is variable. For example, multiyear monitoring of sources at redshift z = 5 with the ELT-HIRES is expected to show a velocity shift Δv = −15 cm s^−1 yr^−1 due to the redshift drift in Planck ΛCDM, while Δv = 0 cm s^−1 yr^−1 in R_h = ct. With an anticipated ELT-HIRES measurement error of ±5 cm s^−1 yr^−1 after 5 yr, these upcoming redshift drift measurements might therefore be able to differentiate between R_h = ct and Planck ΛCDM at ∼3σ, assuming that any possible source evolution is well understood. Such a result would provide the strongest evidence yet in favour of the R_h = ct cosmology. With a 20-yr baseline, these observations could favour one of these models over the other at better than 5σ.",1

52596,2,"Photon Mass Limits from Fast Radio Bursts The frequency-dependent time delays in fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be used to constrain the photon mass, if the FRB redshifts are known, but the similarity between the frequency dependences of dispersion due to plasma effects and a photon mass complicates the derivation of a limit on mγ . The dispersion measure (DM) of FRB 150418 is known to ∼0.1% , and there is a claim to have measured its redshift with an accuracy of ∼2% , but the strength of the constraint on mγ is limited by uncertainties in the modelling of the host galaxy and the Milky Way, as well as possible inhomogeneities in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Allowing for these uncertainties, the recent data on FRB 150418 indicate that mγ≲1.8×10−14 eVc−2 ( 3.2×10−50 kg ), if FRB 150418 indeed has a redshift z=0.492 as initially reported. In the future, the different redshift dependences of the plasma and photon mass contributions to DM can be used to improve the sensitivity to mγ if more FRB redshifts are measured. For a fixed fractional uncertainty in the extra-galactic contribution to the DM of an FRB, one with a lower redshift would provide greater sensitivity to mγ .",1

In particular, we study the position and magnitude of the specific-heat peak as a function of temperature. The obtained results compare well with Monte Carlo simulations. We additionally gauge the accuracy of simplified nonperturbative renormalization-group treatments relying on ϕ4-type truncations.

While the cosmological simulation codes have evolved a lot since the first calculations in the 80s, the computational requirements for generating data that is relevant for large surveys remain challenging. We propose an alternative approach that can speed up these simulations. The framework is based on the idea of reducing the size of the integration region following the lightcone of an observer at redshift zero and thus simulating only the parts of the Universe that can be observed.

52724,2,"Dynamic federation of grid and cloud storage The Dynamic Federations project (“Dynafed”) enables the deployment of scalable, distributed storage systems composed of independent storage endpoints.

The system has been deployed on testbeds covering the majority of the ATLAS and LHCb data, and supports geography-aware replica selection. The work done exploits the federation potential of HTTP to build systems that offer uniform, scalable, catalogue-less access to the storage and metadata ensemble and the possibility of seamless integration of other compatible resources such as those from cloud providers. Dynafed can exploit the potential of the S3 delegation scheme, effectively federating on the fly any number of S3 buckets from different providers and applying a uniform authorization to them. This feature has been used to deploy in production the BOINC Data Bridge, which uses the Uniform Generic Redirector with S3 buckets to harmonize the BOINC authorization scheme with the Grid/X509. The Data Bridge has been deployed in production with good results. We believe that the features of a loosely coupled federation of open-protocolbased storage elements open many possibilities of smoothly evolving the current computing models and of supporting new scientific computing projects that rely on massive distribution of data and that would appreciate systems that can more easily be interfaced with commercial providers and can work natively with Web browsers and clients.",1
52916,2,"Elliptical-like orbits on a warped spandex fabric: A theoretical/experimental undergraduate research project We present a theoretical and experimental analysis of the elliptical-like orbits of a marble rolling on a warped spandex fabric. We arrive at an expression describing the angular separation between successive apocenters, or equivalently successive pericenters, in both the small and large slope regimes. We find that a minimal angular separation of approximately 197 degrees is predicted for orbits with small radial distances when the surface is void of a central mass. We then show that for small radii and large central masses, when the orbiting marble is deep within the well, the angular separation between successive apocenters transitions to values greater than 360 degrees. We lastly compare these expressions to those describing elliptical-like orbits about a static, spherically symmetric massive object in the presence of a constant vacuum energy, as described by general relativity.",1

In this paper, we will show that whenever the interaction potentials are chosen to be weakly nonlocal, the separation of the two families may disappear.

52966,2,"An optical view of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray emitters The Fermi Gamma-ray Observatory discovered about a thousand extragalactic sources emitting energy from 100 MeV to 100 GeV. The majority of these sources belong to the class of blazars characterized by a quasi-featureless optical spectrum (BL Lac Objects). This hampers the determination of their redshift and therefore hinders the characterization of this class of objects. To investigate the nature of these sources and to determine their redshift, we are carrying out an extensive campaign using the 10m Gran Telescopio Canarias to obtain high S/N ratio optical spectra. These observations allow us to confirm the blazar nature of the targets, to find new redshifts or to set stringent limits on the redshift based on the minimum equivalent width of specific absorption features that can be measured in the spectrum and are expected from their host galaxy, assuming it is a massive elliptical galaxy. These results are of importance for the multi-frequencies emission models of the blazars, to test their extreme physics, to shed light on their cosmic evolution and abundance in the far Universe. These gamma emitters are also of great importance for the characterization of the extragalactic background light through the absorption by the IR-optical background photons.",1
52976,2,"Critical phenomena at the complex tensor ordering phase transition We investigate the critical properties of the phase transition towards complex tensor order that has been proposed to occur in spin-orbit-coupled superconductors. For this purpose, we formulate the bosonic field theory for fluctuations of the complex irreducible second-rank tensor order parameter close to the transition. We then determine the scale dependence of the couplings of the theory by means of the perturbative renormalization group (RG). For the isotropic system, we generically detect a fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition. The initial values for the running couplings are determined by the underlying microscopic model for the tensorial order. As an example, we study three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals with electrons at a quadratic band-touching point. Whereas the strong-coupling transition of the model receives substantial fluctuation corrections, the weak-coupling transition at low temperatures is rendered only weakly first order due to the presence of a fixed point in the vicinity of the RG trajectory. If the number of fluctuating complex components of the order parameter is reduced by cubic anisotropy, the theory maps onto the field theory for frustrated magnetism.",1

We develop a natural framework based on Laplace transform as a correspondence between appropriate $L^p$ and Hardy spaces: this point of view allows us to interpret rigorously operators of the form $f(\partial_t)$ where $f$ is an analytic function such as (the analytic continuation of) the Riemann zeta function. We find the most general solution to the equation \begin{equation*} f(\partial_t) \phi = J(t) \; , \; \; \; t \geq 0 \; , \end{equation*} in a convenient class of functions, we define and solve its corresponding initial value problem, and we state conditions under which the solution is of class $C^k,\, k \geq 0$. More specifically, we prove that if some a priori information is specified, then the initial value problem is well-posed and it can be solved using only a {\em finite number} of local initial data. Also, motivated by some intriguing work by Dragovich and Aref'eva-Volovich on cosmology, we solve explicitly field equations of the form \begin{equation*} \zeta(\partial_t + h) \phi = J(t) \; , \; \; \; t \geq 0 \; , \end{equation*} in which $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function and $h > 1$.

53242,2,"Covariant Galilean versus Carrollian hydrodynamics from relativistic fluids We provide the set of equations for non-relativistic fluid dynamics on arbitrary, possibly time-dependent spaces, in general coordinates. These equations are fully covariant under either local Galilean or local Carrollian transformations, and are obtained from standard relativistic hydrodynamics in the limit of infinite or vanishing velocity of light. All dissipative phenomena such as friction and heat conduction are included in our description. Part of our work consists in designing the appropriate coordinate frames for relativistic spacetimes, invariant under Galilean or Carrollian diffeomorphisms. The guide for the former is the dynamics of relativistic point particles, and leads to the Zermelo frame. For the latter, the relevant objects are relativistic instantonic space-filling branes in Randers--Papapetrou backgrounds. We apply our results for obtaining the general first-derivative-order Galilean fluid equations, in particular for incompressible fluids (Navier--Stokes equations) and further illustrate our findings with two applications: Galilean fluids in rotating frames or inflating surfaces and Carrollian conformal fluids on two-dimensional time-dependent geometries.

To improve the understanding of dark current emission, a high-resolution (∼100  μm) dark current imaging experiment has been performed in an L-band photocathode gun operating at ∼100  MV/m of surface gradient. Scattered strong emission areas with high current have been observed on the cathode. The field enhancement factor β of selected regions on the cathode has been measured.

53497,2,"Non-resistive dissipative magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation in the 14-moment approximation We derive the equations of motion of relativistic, non-resistive, second-order dissipative magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. We assume the fluid to be composed of a single type of point-like particles with vanishing dipole moment or spin, so that the fluid has vanishing magnetization and polarization. We also assume the fluid to be non-resistive, which allows to express the electric field in terms of the magnetic field. We derive equations of motion for the irreducible moments of the deviation of the single-particle distribution function from local thermodynamical equilibrium. We analyze the Navier-Stokes limit of these equations, reproducing previous results for the structure of the first-order transport coefficients. Finally, we truncate the system of equations for the irreducible moments using the 14-moment approximation, deriving the equations of motion of relativistic, non-resistive, second-order dissipative magnetohydrodynamics. We also give expressions for new transport coefficients appearing due to the coupling of the magnetic field to the dissipative quantities.",1
53507,2,"Diffuse gamma rays in 3D galactic cosmic-ray propagation models The Picard code for the numerical solution of the Galactic cosmic ray propagation problem allows for high-resolution models that acknowledge the 3D structure of our Galaxy. Picard was used to determine diffuse gamma-ray emission of the Galaxy over the energy range from 100 MeV to 100 TeV. We discuss the impact of a cosmic-ray source distribution aligned with the Galactic spiral arms for a range of such spiral-arm models. As expected, the impact on the gamma-ray emission is most distinct in the inverse-Compton channel, where imprints of the spiral arms are visible and yield predictions that are no longer symmetric to the rotational axis of the Milkyway. We will illustrate these differences by a direct comparison to results from previous axially symmetric Galactic propagation models: we find differences in the gamma-ray flux both on global scales and on local scales related to the spiral arm tangents. We compare gamma-ray flux and spectra at on-arm vs. off-arm projections and characterize the differences to axially symmetric models.",1
53514,2,Embedded star clusters as sources of high-energy cosmic rays: Modelling and constraints Context. Massive stars are mainly found in stellar associations. These massive star clusters occur in the heart of giant molecular clouds. The strong stellar wind activity in these objects generates large bubbles and induces collective effects that could accelerate particles up to high energy and produce gamma-rays. The best way to input an acceleration origin to the stellar wind interaction in massive stellar cluster is to observe young massive star clusters in which no supernova explosion has occurred yet.,1
53526,2,"The correlation of extragalactic $\gamma$-rays with cosmic matter density distributions from weak-gravitational lensing The extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background (EGB) arises from the accumulation of $\gamma$-ray emissions from resolved and unresolved extragalactic sources as well as diffuse processes. It is important to study the statistical properties of the EGB in the context of cosmological structure formation. Known astrophysical $\gamma$-ray sources such as blazars, star-forming galaxies, and radio galaxies are expected to trace the underlying cosmic matter density distribution. We explore the correlation of the EGB from Fermi-LAT data with the large-scale matter density distribution from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) SSP survey. We reconstruct an unbiased surface matter density distribution $\kappa$ at $z<1$ by applying weak-gravitational lensing analysis to the first-year HSC data. We then calculate the $\gamma - \kappa$ cross-correlation. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection, but a weak correlation is found at angular scales of 30-60 arcmin, especially when distant source galaxies at $z > 1$ are used for the lensing $\kappa$ reconstruction. The large-scale correlation suggests strong clustering of high-redshift $\gamma$-ray sources such as blazars. However, the inferred bias factor of $4-5$ is larger by about a factor of two than results from other clustering analyses. The final HSC data covering 1,400 squared degrees will play an essential role to determine accurately the blazar bias at $z > 0.5$.",1

The final avalanche charge was collected in a 2D strip readout, providing an active area of 10×10 cm2 for the entire detection system.

53583,2,"A Peculiar GRB 110731A: Lorentz Factor, Jet Composition, Central Engine, and Progenitor The jet compositions, central engines, and progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remain open questions in GRB physics. Applying broadband observations, including GRB prompt emission and afterglow properties derived from Fermi and Swift data, as well as from Keck host-galaxy observations, we address these questions for the peculiar, bright GRB 110731A. By using the pair-opacity method, we derive Γ(0) > 190 during the prompt emission phase. Alternatively, we derive Γ(0) ≈ 580 and Γ(0) ≈ 154 by invoking the early-afterglow phase within the homogeneous density and wind cases, respectively. On the other hand, nondetection of a thermal component in the spectra suggests that the prompt emission is likely powered by dissipation of a Poynting-flux-dominated jet leading to synchrotron radiation in an optically thin region. The nondetection of a jet break in the X-ray and optical bands allows us to place a lower limit on the jet opening angle θ (j) > 5.°5. Within a millisecond magnetar central engine scenario, we derive the period P (0) and polar magnetic field strength B (p), which have extreme (but still allowed) values. The moderately short observed duration (7.3 s) and relatively large redshift (z = 2.83) place the burst as a “rest-frame short” GRB, so the progenitor of the burst is subject to debate. Its relatively large ${f}_{\mathrm{eff},z}$ parameter (ratio of the 1 s peak flux of a pseudo-GRB and the background flux) and a large physical offset from a potential host galaxy suggest that the progenitor of GRB 110731A may be a compact-star merger.",1
53698,2,"Theoretical accuracy in cosmological growth estimation We elucidate the importance of the consistent treatment of gravity-model specific nonlinearities when estimating the growth of cosmological structures from redshift space distortions (RSD). Within the context of standard perturbation theory (SPT), we compare the predictions of two theoretical templates with redshift space data from COLA (comoving Lagrangian acceleration) simulations in the normal branch of DGP gravity (nDGP) and general relativity (GR). Using COLA for these comparisons is validated using a suite of full N-body simulations for the same theories. The two theoretical templates correspond to the standard general relativistic perturbation equations and those same equations modeled within nDGP. Gravitational clustering nonlinear effects are accounted for by modeling the power spectrum up to one-loop order and redshift space clustering anisotropy is modeled using the Taruya, Nishimichi and Saito (TNS) RSD model. Using this approach, we attempt to recover the simulation’s fiducial logarithmic growth parameter f. By assigning the simulation data with errors representing an idealized survey with a volume of 10  Gpc3/h3, we find the GR template is unable to recover fiducial f to within 1σ at z=1 when we match the data up to kmax=0.195h/Mpc. On the other hand, the DGP template recovers the fiducial value within 1σ. Further, we conduct the same analysis for sets of mock data generated for generalized models of modified gravity using SPT, where again we analyze the GR template’s ability to recover the fiducial value. We find that for models with enhanced gravitational nonlinearity, the theoretical bias of the GR template becomes significant for stage IV surveys. Thus, we show that for the future large data volume galaxy surveys, the self-consistent modeling of non-GR gravity scenarios will be crucial in constraining theory parameters.",1
53734,2,"Modelling spatial variations of the speed of light We extend a new method to measure possible variation of the speed of light by using Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the Hubble function onto an inhomogeneous pressure model of the universe. The method relies on the fact that there is a simple relation between the angular diameter distance (DA) maximum and the Hubble function (H) evaluated at the same maximum-condition redshift, which includes the speed of light c. One limit of such a method was the assumption of the vanishing of spatial curvature (though, as it has been shown, a non-zero curvature has negligible effect). In this paper, apart from taking into account an inhomogeneity, we consider non-zero spatial curvature and calculate an exact relation between DA and H. Our main result is the evaluation if current or future missions such as Square Kilometer Array (SKA) can be sensitive enough to detect any spatial variation of c which can in principle be related to the recently observed spatial variation of the fine structure constant (an effect known as α-dipole).",1

We compute numerically the family of radially symmetric ground-state bright stationary solutions for focusing and defocusing local nonlinearity, keeping in both cases a focusing nonlocal nonlinearity. We also analyze excited states and oscillations induced by fixing the temperature at the borders of the material.

53830,2,"The quantum auxiliary linear problem & quantum Darboux-Backlund transformations We explore the notion of the quantum auxiliary linear problem and the associated problem of quantum Backlund transformations (BT). In this context we systematically construct the analogue of the classical formula that provides the whole hierarchy of the time components of Lax pairs at the quantum level for both closed and open integrable lattice models. The generic time evolution operator formula is particularly interesting and novel at the quantum level when dealing with systems with open boundary conditions. In the same frame we show that the reflection K-matrix can also be viewed as a particular type of BT, fixed at the boundaries of the system. The q-oscillator (q-boson) model, a variant of the Ablowitz-Ladik model, is then employed as a paradigm to illustrate the method. Particular emphasis is given to the time part of the quantum BT as possible connections and applications to the problem of quantum quenches as well as the time evolution of local quantum impurities are evident. A discussion on the use of Bethe states as well as coherent states for the study of the time evolution is also presented.",1
53841,2,"Scrambling and thermalization in a diffusive quantum many-body system Out-of-time ordered (OTO) correlation functions describe scrambling of information in correlated quantum matter. They are of particular interest in incoherent quantum systems lacking well defined quasi-particles. Thus far, it is largely elusive how OTO correlators spread in incoherent systems with diffusive transport governed by a few globally conserved quantities. Here, we study the dynamical response of such a system using high-performance matrix-product-operator techniques. Specifically, we consider the non-integrable, one-dimensional Bose–Hubbard model in the incoherent high-temperature regime. Our system exhibits diffusive dynamics in time-ordered correlators of globally conserved quantities, whereas OTO correlators display a ballistic, light-cone spreading of quantum information. The slowest process in the global thermalization of the system is thus diffusive, yet information spreading is not inhibited by such slow dynamics. We furthermore develop an experimentally feasible protocol to overcome some challenges faced by existing proposals and to probe time-ordered and OTO correlation functions. Our study opens new avenues for both the theoretical and experimental exploration of thermalization and information scrambling dynamics.",1
53899,2,"Investigating scalar-tensor-gravity with statistics of the cosmic large-scale structure In this paper we study Horndeski theories of gravity, the most general minimally coupled scalar-tensor theories of second order. While the cosmological background evolution can be described by an effective equation of state, the perturbations in this class of theories are characterised by four free functions of time. Here, we consider a specific parametrisation of these functions tracing the dark energy component. We evaluate the likelihood of the full parameter set resulting from combining temperature and polarisation fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background including their gravitational lensing signal, tomographic angular galaxy clustering and weak cosmic shear, together with all possible non-vanishing cross-correlations; both for a Gaussian approximation of the likelihood with the Fisher-formalism as well as without the assumption of a specific functional form through Monte-Carlo Markov-chains (MCMCs). Our results show that the combination of stage IV cosmological surveys has a very strong constraining power even on complex cosmological models and could exclude variations of the effective Newtonian gravitational coupling larger than $10\%$ over the age of the Universe. In particular, we confirm strong correlations between parameter groups. Furthermore, we find that the expected contours from MCMC are significantly larger than those from the Fisher analysis even with the vast amount of signal provided by stage IV experiments, illustrating the importance of a proper treatment of non-Gaussian likelihoods and the limiting nature of the Cram{\'e}r-Rao-bound, and the high level of precision one needs for unlocking the sensitivity on gravitational parameters.",1

54026,2,"Cosmic-ray hydrodynamics: Alfv\'en-wave regulated transport of cosmic rays Star formation in galaxies appears to be self-regulated by energetic feedback processes. Among the most promising agents of feedback are cosmic rays (CRs), the relativistic ion population of interstellar and intergalactic plasmas. In these environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless and interact via collective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale magnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical scales requires a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic theory for CR transport in the self-confinement picture, which includes CR diffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields of Alfv\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes CRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\'en velocity if resonant waves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to capture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization schemes to ensure numerical stability. We extent the theory by deriving an equation for the CR energy flux along the mean magnetic field and include a transport equation for the Alfv\'en-wave energy. We account for energy exchange of CRs and Alfv\'en waves via the gyroresonant instability and include other wave damping mechanisms. The resulting system of equations correctly recovers previous macroscopic CR transport formalisms in the steady-state limit. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that our new theory self-regulates CR transport, and highlight differences to currently used algorithms. Our theory is free of tunable parameters and holds the promise to provide predictable simulations of CR feedback in galaxy formation.",1
54028,2,"Duality between the deconfined quantum-critical point and the bosonic topological transition Recently, significant progress has been made in (2+1)-dimensional conformal field theories without supersymmetry. In particular, it was realized that different Lagrangians may be related by hidden dualities; i.e., seemingly different field theories may actually be identical in the infrared limit. Among all the proposed dualities, one has attracted particular interest in the field of strongly correlated quantum-matter systems: the one relating the easy-plane noncompact CP1 model (NCCP1) and noncompact quantum electrodynamics (QED) with two flavors (N=2) of massless two-component Dirac fermions. The easy-plane NCCP1 model is the field theory of the putative deconfined quantum-critical point separating a planar (XY) antiferromagnet and a dimerized (valence-bond solid) ground state, while N=2 noncompact QED is the theory for the transition between a bosonic symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial Mott insulator. In this work, we present strong numerical support for the proposed duality. We realize the N=2 noncompact QED at a critical point of an interacting fermion model on the bilayer honeycomb lattice and study it using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Using stochastic series expansion QMC simulations, we study a planar version of the S=1/2 J-Q spin Hamiltonian (a quantum XY model with additional multispin couplings) and show that it hosts a continuous transition between the XY magnet and the valence-bond solid. The duality between the two systems, following from a mapping of their phase diagrams extending from their respective critical points, is supported by the good agreement between the critical exponents according to the proposed duality relationships. In the J-Q model, we find both continuous and first-order transitions, depending on the degree of planar anisotropy, with deconfined quantum criticality surviving only up to moderate strengths of the anisotropy. This explains previous claims of no deconfined quantum criticality in planar two-component spin models, which were in the strong-anisotropy regime, and opens doors to further investigations of the global phase diagram of systems hosting deconfined quantum-critical points.",1

54109,2,"Density perturbations for running vacuum: a successful approach to structure formation and to the $\sigma_8$-tension Recent studies suggest that dynamical dark energy (DDE) provides a better fit to the rising affluence of modern cosmological observations than the concordance model ($\Lambda$CDM) with a rigid cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. Such is the case with the running vacuum models (RVMs) and to some extent also with a simple XCDM parametrization. Apart from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, the most crucial datasets potentially carrying the DDE signature are: i) baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), and ii) direct large scale structure (LSS) formation data (i.e. the observations on $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts). As it turns out, analyses mainly focusing on CMB and with insufficient BAO+LSS input, or those just making use of gravitational weak-lensing data for the description of structure formation, generally fail to capture the DDE signature, whereas the few existing studies using a rich set of CMB+BAO+LSS data (see in particular Sol\`a, G\'omez-Valent & de Cruz P\'erez 2015,2017; and Zhao et al. 2017) do converge to the remarkable conclusion that DDE might well be encoded in the current cosmological observations. Being the issue so pressing, here we explain both analytically and numerically the origin of the possible hints of DDE in the context of RVMs, which arise at a significance level of $3-4\sigma$. By performing a detailed study on the matter and vacuum perturbations within the RVMs, and comparing with the XCDM, we show why the running vacuum fully relaxes the existing $\sigma_8$-tension and accounts for the LSS formation data much better than the concordance model.",1
54230,2,"On the characterisation of SiPMs from pulse-height spectra Methods are developed, which use the pulse-height spectra of SiPMs measured in the dark and illuminated by pulsed light, to determine the pulse shape, the dark-count rate, the gain, the average number of photons initiating a Geiger discharge, the probabilities for prompt cross-talk and after-pulses, as well as the electronics noise and the gain fluctuations between and in pixels.

54299,2,"Host Galaxy Effects in the Susy Model for Supernovae Ia For more than forty years virtually all work on the theory of type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) has assumed that these explosions were due to the transfer of mass to a degenerate star from a partner in a binary system. In these binary models, when the mass of one partner closely approaches the Chandrasekhar maximum for a stable degenerate system, fusion can be initiated and the star explodes. However, there are now a number of indications that fusion could instead be triggered by a phase transition in a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf star. Although these indications provide no clue as to what specific phase transition initiates the explosion, it is possible that remarkable and well established host galaxy effects as considered in the present work could point to a specific source of the energy deposition. These host galaxy correlations are, at first glance, surprising since the typical distance scale of white dwarf stars is the earth radius while the typical distance between stars is at the light year scale. Performing a least $\chi^2$ fit to the delay time distribution to fix parameters, we give predictions from the susy phase transition model for the host galaxy effects. In addition we discuss a susy insight into the Phillips relation which is basic to the cosmological importance of the type Ia supernovae.",1

For such Hamiltonians, three possible inner products have been considered in the literature, the V norm, the PT norm, and the C norm. Here, V is the operator that implements VHV-1=H†, the PT norm is the overlap of a state with its PT conjugate, and C is a discrete linear operator that always exists for any Hamiltonian that can be diagonalized. Here, we show that it is the V norm that is the most fundamental as it is always chosen by the theory itself. In addition, we show that the V norm is always equal to the PT norm if one defines the PT conjugate of a state to contain its intrinsic PT phase. We discuss the conditions under which the V norm coincides with the C operator norm and show that, in general, one should not use the linear C operator, but for the purposes that it is used one can instead use the antilinear PT operator itself.",1
54511,2,"Non-linear stability of the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter family of charged black holes We prove the global non-linear stability, without symmetry assumptions, of slowly rotating charged black holes in de Sitter spacetimes in the context of the initial value problem for the Einstein-Maxwell equations: If one perturbs the initial data of a slowly rotating Kerr-Newman-de Sitter (KNdS) black hole, then in a neighborhood of the exterior region of the black hole, the metric and the electromagnetic field decay exponentially fast to their values for a possibly different member of the KNdS family. This is a continuation of recent work of the author with Vasy on the stability of the Kerr-de Sitter family for the Einstein vacuum equations. Our non-linear iteration scheme automatically finds the final black hole parameters as well as the gauge in which the global solution exists; we work in a generalized wave coordinate/Lorenz gauge, with gauge source functions lying in a suitable finite-dimensional space. We include a self-contained proof of the linear mode stability of Reissner-Nordstr\""om-de Sitter black holes, building on work by Kodama-Ishibashi. In the course of our non-linear stability argument, we also obtain the first proof of the linear (mode) stability of slowly rotating KNdS black holes using robust perturbative techniques.",1

The models involve coupling emergent gauge fields to a fractionalized SDW order, but retain the canonical electron operator in the underlying Hamiltonian.

54574,2,"Influence of the cusp field on the plasma parameters of the Linac4 H− ion source When the H$^−$ ion source of CERN’s Linac4 is operated in volume mode, a maximum of the extracted current is obtained at varying RF power. The power required for this maximum and its absolute value is strongly influenced by the cusp magnets installed at the source for electron confinement: without magnets, 15−20 mA are typically obtained at 20 kW whereas with magnets a factor of two more power is needed and 25−30 mA are achieved. In order to access the reasons behind the peaked performance with varying RF power and for determining the influence of the cusp field on the discharge, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) measurements of the atomic Balmer series and of the molecular Fulcher transition have been carried out. In all investigated cases, the gas temperature of the discharge has been virtually equal to the ambient temperature as the short discharge pulse length of 500 $\mu$s is not long enough for considerable heavy particle heating. When no cusp magnets are installed, the plasma parameters evaluated with the collisional radiative models Yacora H and Yacora H$_2$ show a minimum in the electron temperature of 3.25 eV and a maximum in the electron density of $4 \times 10^{19} m^{−3}$ and also in the vibrational excitation of the hydrogen molecule at 20 kW. Assessing the relevant production and destruction processes demonstrates that the H$^−$ yield is maximal at this point thereby explaining the optimum ion source performance. When the cusp magnets are applied, the same general trends are observed but the required RF power is a factor of two higher. The OES results indicate an optimum performance around 30 kW whereas the highest H$^−$ current is actually achieved around 40 kW. Furthermore, a higher H$^−$ yield is indicated without cusp magnets but a better ion source performance is observed with magnets. These differences can most likely be attributed to changing gradients in the plasma parameters which are not accessible by OES. Nevertheless, the obtained plasma parameters can be used as benchmark for RF coupling codes simulating the Linac4 ion source.",1

The spinor wavefunction is written as a bounded sum in a complete set of square integrable basis, which is chosen such that the matrix representation of the Dirac wave operator is tridiagonal and symmetric. This makes the matrix wave equation a symmetric three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the wavefunction. We solve the recursion relation exactly in terms of orthogonal polynomials and obtain the state functions and corresponding relativistic energy spectrum and phase shift.",1
54762,2,"Low Emittance Growth in a LEBT with Un-Neutralized Section In a Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT), the emittance growth due to the beam's own space charge is typically suppressed by way of neutralization from either electrons or ions, which originate from ionization of the background gas. In cases where the beam is chopped, the neutralization pattern changes throughout the beginning of the pulse, causing the Twiss parameters to differ significantly from their steady state values, which, in turn, may result in beam losses downstream. For a modest beam perveance, there is an alternative solution, in which the beam is kept un-neutralized in the portion of the LEBT that contains the chopper. The emittance can be nearly preserved if the transition to the un-neutralized section occurs where the beam exhibits low transverse tails. This report discusses the experimental realization of such a scheme at Fermilab's PXIE, where low beam emittance dilution was demonstrated",1
54809,2,"Nonlinear dynamics from the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker spacetime The dissipative dynamics of an expanding massless gas with constant cross section in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe is studied. The mathematical problem of solving the full nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation is recast into an infinite set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the moments of the one-particle distribution function. Momentum-space resolution is determined by the number of nonhydrodynamic modes included in the moment hierarchy, i.e., by the truncation order. We show that in the FLRW spacetime the nonhydrodynamic modes decouple completely from the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. This results in the system flowing as an ideal fluid while at the same time producing entropy. The solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation exhibit transient tails of the distribution function with nontrivial momentum dependence. The evolution of this tail is not correctly captured by the relaxation time approximation nor by the linearized Boltzmann equation. However, the latter probes additional high-momentum details unresolved by the relaxation time approximation. While the expansion of the FLRW spacetime is slow enough for the system to move towards (and not away from) local thermal equilibrium, it is not sufficiently slow for the system to actually ever reach complete local equilibrium. Equilibration is fastest in the relaxation time approximation, followed, in turn, by kinetic evolution with a linearized and a fully nonlinear Boltzmann collision term.",1

54874,2,"Separation of Maxwell equations in Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetimes In this paper we explicitly demonstrate separability of the Maxwell equations in a wide class of higher-dimensional metrics which include the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS solution as a special case. Namely, we prove such separability for the most general metric admitting the principal tensor (a non-degenerate closed conformal Killing-Yano 2-form). To this purpose we use a special ansatz for the electromagnetic potential, which we represent as a product of a (rank 2) polarization tensor with the gradient of a potential function, generalizing the ansatz recently proposed by Lunin. We show that for a special choice of the polarization tensor written in terms of the principal tensor, both the Lorenz gauge condition and the Maxwell equations reduce to a composition of mutually commuting operators acting on the potential function. A solution to both these equations can be written in terms of an eigenfunction of these commuting operators. When incorporating a multiplicative separability ansatz, it turns out that the eigenvalue equations reduce to a set of separated ordinary differential equations with the eigenvalues playing a role of separability constants. The remaining ambiguity in the separated equations is related to an identification of D-2 polarizations of the electromagnetic field. We thus obtained a sufficiently rich set of solutions for the Maxwell equations in these spacetimes.",1

55224,2,"Excitation of a nonlinear plasma ion wake by intense energy sources with applications to the crunch-in regime We show the excitation of a nonlinear ion-wake mode by plasma electron modes in the bubble regime driven by intense energy sources, using analytical theory and simulations. The ion wake is shown to be a driven nonlinear ion-acoustic wave in the form of a long-lived cylindrical ion soliton which limits the repetition rate of a plasma-based particle accelerator in the bubble regime. We present the application of this evacuated and radially outwards propagating ion-wake channel with an electron skin-depth scale radius for the “crunch-in” regime of hollow-channel plasma. It is shown that the time-asymmetric focusing force phases in the bubble couple to ion motion significantly differently than in the linear electron mode. The electron compression in the back of the bubble sucks in the ions whereas the space charge within the bubble cavity expels them, driving a cylindrical ion-soliton structure at the bubble radius. Once formed, the soliton is sustained and driven radially outwards by the thermal pressure of the wake energy in electrons. Particle-in-cell simulations are used to study the ion-wake soliton structure, its driven propagation and its use for positron acceleration in the crunch-in regime.",1
55229,2,"Cosmological perturbations in the $\Lambda$CDM-like limit of a polytropic dark matter model It has recently been proposed that both dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) can be treated as a single component when they are considered in the context of a polytropic DM fluid with thermodynamical content. Depending on only one free parameter, that is, the polytropic exponent, − 0.103 < Γ ≤ 0, this unified DM model reproduces the distance measurements performed with the aid of the supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) standard candles to high accuracy. It avoids the age problem and the coincidence problem, meaning that it allows interpreting not only when, but also why the Universe so recently transited from deceleration to acceleration. However, a critical problem still remains that the polytropic DM model is also required to solve, that is, it needs to demonstrate its compatibility with current observational data on structure formation. We begin to untie this knot here by discussing the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the ΛCDM-like (i.e., Γ = 0) limit of the polytropic DM model. The corresponding results are quite encouraging because this model reproduces every major effect known from conventional (i.e., pressureless cold dark matter – CDM) structure formation theory, such as the constancy of metric perturbations in the vicinity of recombination and the (late-time) Meszaros effect on their rest-mass density counterparts. The non-zero (polytropic) pressure, on the other hand, drives the evolution of small-scale velocity perturbations along the lines of the root-mean-square velocity law of conventional statistical physics. As a consequence, peculiar velocities in this model slightly increase instead of being redshifted away by cosmic expansion. This result might comprise a convenient probe of the polytropic DM model with Γ = 0. Even more importantly, however, upon consideration of scale-invariant metric perturbations, the spectrum of their rest-mass density counterparts exhibits an effective power-law dependence on the (physical) wavenumber, kph, of the form kph3+nseff, with the associated scalar spectral index, nseff, being equal to nseff = 0.970. This theoretical value reproduces the corresponding observational Planck result, that is, nsobs = 0.968 ± 0.006.Key words: cosmological parameters / dark energy / dark matter / cosmology: theory",1

Here a (collection of) gauge field(s) balances anisotropic spatial curvature on the right-hand side of the shear propagation equation. The result is a class of solutions dynamically equivalent to standard FLRW cosmologies, with an effective curvature constant that depends both on spatial curvature and the energy density of the gauge field(s). In the case of a single gauge field (n  =  1) we show that the only spacetimes that admit such solutions are the LRS Bianchi type III, Bianchi type VI0 and Kantowski–Sachs metric, which are dynamically equivalent to open (), flat () and closed () FLRW models, respectively.

55327,2,"Cosmological Tests with the FSRQ Gamma-ray Luminosity Function The extensive catalogue of gamma-ray selected flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) produced by Fermi during a four-year survey has generated considerable interest in determining their gamma-ray luminosity function (GLF) and its evolution with cosmic time. In this paper, we introduce the novel idea of using this extensive database to test the differential volume expansion rate predicted by two specific models, the concordance Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) and R_h = ct cosmologies. For this purpose, we use two well-studied formulations of the GLF, one based on pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and the other on a luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE). Using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test on one-parameter cumulative distributions (in luminosity, redshift, photon index and source count), we confirm the results of earlier works showing that these data somewhat favour LDDE over PLE; we show that this is the case for both ΛCDM and R_h = ct. Regardless of which GLF one chooses, however, we also show that model selection tools very strongly favour R_h = ct over ΛCDM. We suggest that such population studies, though featuring a strong evolution in redshift, may none the less be used as a valuable independent check of other model comparisons based solely on geometric considerations.",1

It is found if we once integrate the gravitational field equation by parts. This allows us to extend these results directly to the Einstein-Cartan theory.

55353,2,"Model Selection with Strong-lensing Systems In this paper, we use an unprecedentedly large sample (158) of confirmed strong lens systems for model selection, comparing five well studied Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies: LCDM, wCDM (the standard model with a variable dark-energy equation of state), the R_h=ct universe, the (empty) Milne cosmology, and the classical Einstein-de Sitter (matter dominated) universe. We first use these sources to optimize the parameters in the standard model and show that they are consistent with Planck, though the quality of the best fit is not satisfactory. We demonstrate that this is likely due to under-reported errors, or to errors yet to be included in this kind of analysis. We suggest that the missing dispersion may be due to scatter about a pure single isothermal sphere (SIS) model that is often assumed for the mass distribution in these lenses. We then use the Bayes information criterion, with the inclusion of a suggested SIS dispersion, to calculate the relative likelihoods and ranking of these models, showing that Milne and Einstein-de Sitter are completely ruled out, while R_h=ct is preferred over LCDM/wCDM with a relative probability of ~73% versus ~24%.

In the coming years, neutron beam intensities never reached up to now will be available, thus opening new scientific and technological frontiers. Among existing facilities, n_TOF at CERN provides a high intensity pulsed neutron beam in a wide energy range (thermal to GeV) and with an extremely competitive energy resolution that also allows spectroscopy studies. In order to ensure high quality measurements, the neutron beams must be fully characterized as a function of the neutron energy, in particular by measuring the neutron flux and the beam transverse profile with high accuracy. In 2014 a new experimental area (EAR2), with a much higher neutron flux, has been completed and commissioned at n_TOF. In order to characterize the neutron beam in the newly built experimental area at n_TOF, two suitable diagnostics devices have been built by the INFN-LNS group. Both are based on silicon detectors coupled with $^{6}$Li converter foils, in particular Single Pad for the flux measurement and Position Sensitive (strips and others) for the beam profile. The devices have been completely characterized with radioactive sources and with the n_TOF neutron beam, fulfilling all the specifications and hence becoming immediately operational.

55630,2,"Accuracy of the geometric-mean method for determining spatial resolutions of tracking detectors in the presence of multiple Coulomb scattering The geometric-mean method is often used to estimate the spatial resolution of a position-sensitive detector probed by tracks. It calculates the resolution solely from measured track data without using a detailed tracking simulation and without considering multiple Coulomb scattering effects. Two separate linear track fits are performed on the same data, one excluding and the other including the hit from the probed detector. The geometric mean of the widths of the corresponding exclusive and inclusive residual distributions for the probed detector is then taken as a measure of the intrinsic spatial resolution of the probed detector: σ=√σ(ex)·σ(in). The validity of this method is examined for a range of resolutions with a stand-alone Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation that specifically takes multiple Coulomb scattering in the tracking detector materials into account. Using simulated as well as actual tracking data from a representative beam test scenario, we find that the geometric-mean method gives systematically inaccurate spatial resolution results. Good resolutions are estimated as poor and vice versa. The more the resolutions of reference detectors and probed detector differ, the larger the systematic bias. An attempt to correct this inaccuracy by statistically subtracting multiple-scattering effects from geometric-mean results leads to resolutions that are typically too optimistic by 10–50%. This supports an earlier critique of this method based on simulation studies that did not take multiple scattering into account.",1

Using 7.6 years of Fermi-LAT observation data, we detected an extended γ-ray source (“source A”) with centroid on the west of the SNR, with a significance of 21σ in 0.1–300 GeV and an error circle of 5.′4 in angular radius. The γ-ray spectrum cannot be reproduced by a pure leptonic emission or a pure emission from the magnetar, and thus a hadronic emission component is needed. The CO-line observations reveal a molecular cloud (MC) at V LSR ∼ 90 km s−1, which demonstrates morphological correspondence with the western boundary of the SNR brightened in multiwavelength. The 12CO (J = 2 − 1)/12CO (J = 1 − 0) ratio in the left (blue) wing 85–88 km s−1 is prominently elevated to ∼1.1 along the northwestern boundary, providing kinematic evidence of the SNR-MC interaction. This SNR-MC association yields a kinematic distance 9 kpc to Kes 73. The MC is shown to be capable of accounting for the hadronic γ-ray emission component. The γ-ray spectrum can be interpreted with a pure hadronic emission or a magnetar+hadronic hybrid emission. In the case of pure hadronic emission, the spectral index of the protons is 2.4, very similar to that of the radio-emitting electrons, essentially consistent with the diffusive shock acceleration theory.

Despite this achievement, measurements in other less precise systems remain relevant as conflicting results could uncover unknown systematic effects or even new physics. One such system is the superallowed mixed transition, which can help refine the same theoretical corrections used for pure Fermi transitions and hence improve the accuracy of Vud . However, as a corrected Ft -value determination from these systems requires the more challenging determination of the Fermi Gamow–Teller mixing ratio, only five transitions, spreading from 19 Ne to 37 K, are currently fully characterized. There are several ongoing efforts to determine the mixing ratios for medium-mass nuclei. Measuring transitions in lighter nuclei, such as 17 F, 15 O, 13 N and 11 C, poses new challenges as their longer half-lives, ranging from 1 to 22 min, conflict with the time constraints present at the large radioactive ion beam facilities where these nuclei are typically produced.

55907,2,"Do Black Holes Exist in a Finite Universe Having the Topology of a Flat 3-Torus? Based on perturbation theory, we present the exact first-order solution to the Einstein equations for the exterior static gravitational field of an isolated non-rotating star in a spatially finite universe having the topology of a flat 3-torus. Since the method of images leads to a divergent Poincare' series, one needs a regularization which we achieve by using the Appell respectively the Epstein zeta function. The solution depends on a new positive constant which is completely fixed by the mass of the star and the spatial volume of the universe. The physical interpretation is that a stable or metastable equilibrium requires a topological dark energy which fills the whole universe with positive energy density and negative pressure. The properties of the gravitational field are discussed in detail. In particular, its anisotropy is made explicit by deriving an exact multipole expansion which shows that in this case Birkhoff's theorem does not hold. While the monopole describes the Newtonian potential, there is no dipole but always a non-vanishing quadrupole which leads to a repulsive force experienced by a planet at rest. Finally, we put forward the conjecture that black holes exist in a toroidal universe and that their gravitational field is in the weak-field limit well approximated by the first-order field.",1

We posit a thermal Compton hard X-ray spectrum for coronal emission; at high accretion rates, it is almost entirely produced in the mini-disks, but at lower accretion rates it is the primary radiation mechanism in the mini-disks and accretion streams as well.

To this purpose we use halo catalogs from N-body simulations of dynamical DE models and DM scenarios which are as successful as the standard Cold Dark Matter model with Cosmological Constant (ΛCDM) at interpreting available cosmological observations. We limit our analysis to halo catalogs at redshift z=1 and 2.3 which are common to all simulations. For each catalog we model the HI distribution by using a simple prescription to associate the HI gas mass to N-body halos. We find that the DE models leave a distinct signature on the HI spectra across a wide range of scales, which correlates with differences in the halo mass function and the onset of the non-linear regime of clustering. In the case of the non-standard DM model significant differences of the HI spectra with respect to the ΛCDM model only arise from the suppressed abundance of low mass halos. These cosmological model dependent features also appear in the 21cm spectra. In particular, we find that future SKA measurements can distinguish the imprints of DE and DM models at high statistical significance.",1
56153,2,"Dynamics of a quantum phase transition in the Bose-Hubbard model: Kibble-Zurek mechanism and beyond In this paper, we study the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model by using time-dependent Gutzwiller methods. In particular, we vary the parameters in the Hamiltonian as a function of time, and investigate the temporal behavior of the system from the Mott insulator to the superfluid (SF) crossing a second-order phase transition. We first solve a time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the experimental setup recently done by Braun et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 112, 3641 (2015)] and show that the numerical and experimental results are in fairly good agreement. However, these results disagree with the Kibble-Zurek scaling. From our numerical study, we reveal a possible source of the discrepancy. Next, we calculate the critical exponents of the correlation length and vortex density in addition to the SF order parameter for a Kibble-Zurek protocol. We show that beside the “freeze” time t̂, there exists another important time, teq, at which an oscillating behavior of the SF amplitude starts. From calculations of the exponents of the correlation length and vortex density with respect to a quench time τQ, we obtain a physical picture of a coarsening process. Finally, we study how the system evolves after the quench. We give a global picture of dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model.",1
56199,2,"Quasi-integrability of deformations of the KdV equation We investigate the quasi-integrability properties of various deformations of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, depending on two parameters $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$, which include among them the regularized long-wave (RLW) and modified regularized long-wave (mRLW) equations. We show, using analytical and numerical methods, that the charges, constructed from a deformation of the zero curvature equation for the KdV equation, are asymptotically conserved for various values of the deformation parameters. By that we mean that, despite the fact that the charges do vary in time during the scattering of solitons, they return after the scattering to the same values they had before it. That property was tested numerically for the scattering of two and three solitons, and analytically for the scattering of two solitons in the mRLW theory ($\varepsilon_2=\varepsilon_1=1$). We also show that the Hirota method leads to analytical one-soliton solutions of our deformed equation for $\varepsilon_1 = 1$, and any value of $\varepsilon_2$. We also mention some properties of soliton-radiation interactions seen in some of our simulations.",1
56203,2,"Simulation Studies of Transverse Beam Instabilities and Measures Beyond 1 MW Beam Power in the 3-GeV RCS of J-PARC The transverse impedance of the extraction kicker magnets is a significant beam instability source in the 3-GeV RCS (Rapid Cycling Synchrotron) of J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex). The systematic simulation studies for beam instability by including the space charge effect has been done by using the ORBIT code. The simulation results are well reproduced in the corresponding measurements. The designed 1 MW beam power has recently been accomplished by keeping sextuple magnets off in order to stabilize the beam by utilizing the large lattice chromaticity throughout the entire acceleration period. The RCS simultaneously delivers extracted beam to the MLF (Material and Life Science Experimental Facility) and the MR (Main Ring). In order to ensure 1 MW beam power at the MLF even when RCS beam sharing to the MR is twice increased as well as when a second target station is constructed at the MLF, a beam power of 1.5 MW has to be realized in the RCS. However, the simulation shows that beyond 1 MW the beam is unstable even if no chromaticity is corrected. A reduction of the kicker impedance by at least a half is required in order to achieve 1.5 MW beam power in the RCS.",1
56238,2,"Many-terminal Majorana island: From topological to multichannel Kondo model We study Kondo screening obtained by coupling Majorana bound states, located on a topological superconducting island, to interacting electronic reservoirs. At the charge degeneracy points of the island, we formulate an exact mapping onto the spin-1/2 multichannel Kondo effect. The coupling to Majorana fermions transforms the tunneling terms into effective fermionic bilinear contributions with a Luttinger parameter K in the leads that is effectively doubled. For strong interactions K=1/2, the intermediate fixed point of the standard multichannel Kondo model is exactly recovered. It evolves with K and connects to strong coupling in the noninteracting case K=1, with maximum conductance between the leads and robustness against channel asymmetries similarly to the topological Kondo effect. For a number of leads above four, there exists a window of Luttinger parameters in which a quantum phase transition can occur between the strong coupling topological Kondo state and the partially conducting multichannel Kondo state.",1
56386,2,"Half vortex and fractional electrical charge in two dimensions Despite fermion doubling, a two-dimensional quasi-relativistic spin-1/2 system can still lead to true fractionalization of electrical charge, when a massive ordered phase supports a “half-vortex”. Such topological defect is possible when the order parameter in form of Dirac mass is described by two U(1) angles, and each of them winds by an angle π around a point. We demonstrate that such a mass configuration in an eight-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian exhibits only a single bound zero mode, and therefore binds the charge of e/2. In graphene, for example, such an ordered phase is provided by the easy-plane spin-triplet Kekule valence bond solid. We argue that an application of an in-plane magnetic field can cause an excitonic instability toward such ordered phase, even for weak repulsion, when the on-site, nearest-neighbor, and second neighbor components of it are of comparable strengths.",1
56417,2,"A 2500 deg$^2$ CMB Lensing Map from Combined South Pole Telescope and Planck Data We present a cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing map produced from a linear combination of South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck temperature data. The 150 GHz temperature data from the 2500 deg(2) SPT-SZ survey is combined with the Planck 143 GHz data in harmonic space to obtain a temperature map that has a broader ℓ coverage and less noise than either individual map. Using a quadratic estimator technique on this combined temperature map, we produce a map of the gravitational lensing potential projected along the line of sight. We measure the auto-spectrum of the lensing potential ${C}_{L}^{\phi \phi }$, and compare it to the theoretical prediction for a ΛCDM cosmology consistent with the Planck 2015 data set, finding a best-fit amplitude of ${0.95}_{-0.06}^{+0.06}(\mathrm{stat}.{)}_{-0.01}^{+0.01}(\mathrm{sys}.)$. The null hypothesis of no lensing is rejected at a significance of 24σ. One important use of such a lensing potential map is in cross-correlations with other dark matter tracers. We demonstrate this cross-correlation in practice by calculating the cross-spectrum, ${C}_{L}^{\phi G}$, between the SPT+Planck lensing map and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) galaxies. We fit ${C}_{L}^{\phi G}$ to a power law of the form ${p}_{L}=a{(L/{L}_{0})}^{-b}$ with a, L (0), and b fixed, and find ${\eta }^{\phi G}={C}_{L}^{\phi G}/{p}_{L}={0.94}_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$, which is marginally lower, but in good agreement with ${\eta }^{\phi G}={1.00}_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$, the best-fit amplitude for the cross-correlation of Planck-2015 CMB lensing and WISE galaxies over ∼67% of the sky. The lensing potential map presented here will be used for cross-correlation studies with the Dark Energy Survey, whose footprint nearly completely covers the SPT 2500 deg(2) field.",1

In addition, the dipolar electromagnetic radiation and energy losses from the rotating magnetized compact star in conformal gravity have been studied. With the aim to find observational constraints on the $L$ parameter of conformal gravity, the theoretical results for the electromagnetic radiation from the rotating magnetized relativistic star in conformal gravity have been combined with the precise observational data on the radio pulsars periods slow down and it is estimated that the upper limit i.e. the maximum value of the parameter of conformal gravity is less than $L \lesssim 9.5 \times 10^5\textrm{cm}$ ($L/M \lesssim 5$).",1

The SN equation predicts that the dynamics of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator’s center-of-mass wave function differ from the predictions of standard quantum mechanics [H. Yang, H. Miao, D.-S. Lee, B. Helou, and Y. Chen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 170401 (2013)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.110.170401]. This difference is largest for low-frequency oscillators, and for materials, such as tungsten or osmium, with small quantum fluctuations of the constituent atoms around their lattice equilibrium sites. Light probes the motion of these oscillators and is eventually measured in order to extract valuable information on the pendulum’s dynamics. Due to the nonlinearity contained in the SN equation, we analyze the fluctuations of measurement results differently than standard quantum mechanics. We revisit how to model a thermal bath, and the wave-function collapse postulate, resulting in two prescriptions for analyzing the quantum measurement of the light. We demonstrate that both predict features, in the outgoing light’s phase fluctuations’ spectrum, which are separate from classical thermal fluctuations and quantum shot noise, and which can be clearly resolved with state of the art technology.",1

The EuCARD-2 collaboration is liaising with similar programs for high field magnets in the USA and Japan. EuCARD-2 focuses, through the work-package 10 “Future magnets,” on the development of a 10 kA-class superconducting, high current density cable suitable for accelerator magnets, for a 5 T stand-alone dipole of 40 mm bore and about 1 m length. After standalone testing, the magnet will possibly be inserted in a large bore background dipole, to be tested at a peak field up to 18 T. This paper starts by reporting on a few of the highlight simulations that demonstrate the progress made in predicting: dynamic current distribution and influence on field quality, complex quench propagation between tapes, and minimum quench energy in the multitape cable. The multiphysics output importantly helps predicting quench signals and guides the development of the novel early detection systems. Knowing current position within individual tapes of each cable we present stress distribution throughout the coils. We report on the development of the mechanical component and assembly processes selected for Feather-M2 the 5 T EuCARD2 magnet.

56775,2,"Japanese Cosmic Dawn/Epoch of Reionization Science with the Square Kilometre Array Cosmic reionization is known to be a major phase transition of the gas in the Universe. Since astronomical objects formed in the early Universe, such as the first stars, galaxies and black holes, are expected to have caused cosmic reionization, the formation history and properties of such objects are closely related to the reionization process. In spite of the importance of exploring reionization, our understandings regarding reionization is not sufficient yet. Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a next-generation large telescope that will be operated in the next decade. Although several programs of next-generation telescopes are currently scheduled, the SKA will be the unique telescope with a potential to directly observe neutral hydrogen up to z~30, and provide us with valuable information on the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).

The large-area picosecond photodetector (LAPPD) collaboration is developing new techniques for making large-area photodetectors based on new MCP fabrication and functionalization methods. A small single tube processing system (SmSTPS) was constructed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) for developing scalable, cost-effective, glass-body, 6 cm x 6 cm, picosecond photodetectors based on MCPs functionalized by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Recently, a number of fully processed and hermitically sealed prototypes made of MCPs with 20 micron pores have been fabricated. This is a significant milestone for the LAPPD project. These prototypes were characterized with a pulsed laser test facility. Without optimization, the prototypes have shown excellent results: The time resolution is ~57 ps for single photoelectron mode and ~15 ps for multi-photoelectron mode; the best position resolution is < 0.8 mm for large pulses.

56824,2,"C -band disk-loaded-type accelerating structure for a high acceleration gradient and high-repetition-rate operation A high-acceleration-gradient linear accelerator (LINAC) for an x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) offers the advantages of a short accelerator length and low construction costs. In addition, the high pulse repetition rate of the LINAC, which can drive multiple x-ray beam lines, provides additional user opportunities for experiments involving XFEL. A C-band disk-loaded-type accelerating structure was developed to achieve a high acceleration gradient of >50  MV/m and an rf-pulse repetition rate of 120 pps, which is twice as high as that of the XFEL facility, SACLA (60 pps). The structure has a quasiconstant gradient and a traveling wave type with an accelerating mode of TM01−2π/3. To reduce the surface electric fields, we employed a cross section with an ellipsoidal curvature around an iris aperture. The accelerating structure was manufactured for SACLA. High-power rf conditioning was conducted to investigate its performance. Owing to the conditioning, the acceleration gradient reached a value of more than 50.1  MV/m. The structure was operated without any serious issues at a repetition rate of 120 pps. The accelerating structures were installed in the dedicated accelerator for EUV-FEL at SACLA beam line-1. Finally, we obtained accelerated electron beams with the structures operated at an acceleration gradient of 41.4  MV/m.",1

Although it is unrelated to the gravitational wave trigger, this SN was discovered as a happy by-product of the extensive observational campaign dedicated to the follow-up of Advanced LIGO event GW 170104. The spectroscopic properties and inferred peak bolometric luminosity of iPTF17cw are most similar to the gamma-ray-burst (GRB)-associated SN, SN 1998bw, while the shape of the r-band light curve is most similar to that of the relativistic SN, SN 2009bb. Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the iPTF17cw field reveal a radio counterpart ≈10 times less luminous than SN 1998bw, and with a peak radio luminosity comparable to that of SN 2006aj/GRB 060218 and SN 2010bh/GRB 100316D. Our radio observations of iPTF17cw imply a relativistically expanding outflow. However, further late-time observations with the VLA in its most extended configuration are needed to confirm fading of the iPTF17cw radio counterpart at all frequencies. X-ray observations carried out with Chandra reveal the presence of an X-ray counterpart with a luminosity similar to that of SN 2010bh/GRB 100316D. Searching the Fermi catalog for possible γ-rays reveals that GRB 161228B is spatially and temporally compatible with iPTF17cw. The similarity to SN 1998bw and SN 2009bb, the radio and X-ray detections, and the potential association with GRB 161228B all point to iPTF17cw being a new candidate member of the rare sample of optically discovered engine-driven BL-Ic SNe associated with relativistic ejecta.",1

In this article we extend the methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics SUSYQM to SQM. With the purpose of applications in quantum systems, the factorization method of the quantum mechanical formalism is then set within supersymmetric SQM.

We illustrate the results by computing the states and spectra of the problem of a charged particle in a homogeneous magnetic field as well as the corresponding Wigner function.",1
57111,2,"Cosmological Structure Formation: From Dawn till Dusk – From Reionization to Galaxy Clusters Cosmology has entered an era where a plethora data is available on structure formation to constrain astrophysics and underlying cosmology. This thesis strives to both investigate new observables and modeling of the Epoch of Reionization, as well as to constrain dark energy phenomenology with massive galaxy clusters, traveling from the dawn of structure formation, when the first galaxies appear, to its dusk, when a representative part of the mass in the Universe is settled in massive structures. This hunt for accurate constraints on cosmology is complemented with the demonstration of novel Bayesian statistical tools and kinematical constraints on dark energy. Starting at the dawn of structure formation, we study emission line fluctuations, employing semi-numerical simulations of cosmological volumes of their line emission, in order to cross-correlate fluctuations in brightness. This cross-correlation signal encodes information about the state of the inter-galactic medium, testing neutral versus ionized medium. It thus constrains reionization, crucially depending on the first ionizing sources, as well as the growth of structure and therefore cosmology. The detectability of cross-correlation signals is demonstrated, opening an avenue for a wealth of future observables. At dusk we employ the abundance of galaxy clusters to constrain both a standard dark energy scenario and dark energy of negligible sound speed. The latter implies significant perturbations and therefore clustering of the dark energy fluid, which we strive to measure. The stage for using non-linear cosmological model information in cluster growth analyses is set, by re-calibrating the halo mass function. Both models are constrained with cluster growth data and jointly with other cosmological probes, to find a shift between them, as well as differing constraints for Fisher matrix forecasts. Therefore, the growth of structure and cosmological parameters are shown to be sensitive to the presence of dark energy perturbations. Lastly, a novel Bayesian approach is presented, this enables us to enhance the accuracy of our measurements by identifying biased subsets of data and hidden correlation in a model independent way.",1
57112,2,"Testing the Kerr metric with the iron line and the KRZ parametrization The spacetime geometry around astrophysical black holes is supposed to be well approximated by the Kerr metric, but deviations from the Kerr solution are predicted in a number of scenarios involving new physics. Broad iron Kα lines are commonly observed in the X-ray spectrum of black holes and originate by X-ray fluorescence of the inner accretion disk. The profile of the iron line is sensitively affected by the spacetime geometry in the strong gravity region and can be used to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. In this paper, we extend previous work in the literature. In particular: i) as test-metric, we employ the parametrization recently proposed by Konoplya, Rezzolla, and Zhidenko, which has a number of subtle advantages with respect to the existing approaches, ii) we perform simulations with specific X-ray missions, and we consider NuSTAR as a prototype of current observational facilities and eXTP as an example of the next generation of X-ray observatories. We find a significant difference between the constraining power of NuSTAR and eXTP. With NuSTAR, it is difficult or impossible to constrain deviations from the Kerr metric. With eXTP, in most cases we can obtain quite stringent constraints (modulo we have the correct astrophysical model).",1

57384,2,"Renyi entropy of highly entangled spin chains Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum theory and a main resource in quantum information science. Ground states of quantum many-body systems with local interactions typically obey an ""area law"" meaning the entanglement entropy proportional to the boundary length. It is exceptional when the system is gapless, and the area law had been believed to be violated by at most a logarithm for over two decades. Recent discovery of Shor-Movassagh and Fredkin spin chain models is striking, since these models provide significant violation of the entanglement beyond the belief, growing as a square root of the volume in spite of local interactions. Although importance of intensive study of the models is undoubted to reveal novel features of quantum entanglement, it is still far from their complete understanding. In this article, we first analytically compute the Renyi entropy of the Shor-Movassagh and Fredkin models by careful treatment of asymptotic analysis. The Renyi entropy is an important quantity, since the whole spectrum of an entangled subsystem is reconstructed once the Renyi entropy is known as a function of its parameter. We find non-analytic behavior of the Renyi entropy with respect to the parameter, which is a novel phase transition never seen in any other spin model studied so far. The Renyi entropy grows proportionally to the volume in one phase, whereas it scales as a logarithm of the volume in another phase. The transition point itself forms the third phase of the square-root scaling.",1

The origin of the repulsion has been considered to be due to the Pauli principle, similar to the repulsion originally revealed in α-α scattering, in many studies including recent lattice QCD calculations. On the other hand, very recently it was shown that an internuclear potential including α-α interactions has a Luneburg-lens-like attraction at short distances rather than repulsion. I show that the nuclear force with an attractive potential at short distances that reproduces the experimental S01 phase shifts well has a Luneburg-lens-like structural Pauli attractive core at short distances and acts as apparent repulsion. The apparent repulsion is caused by the deeply embedded unobservable Pauli forbidden state similar to nucleus-nucleus potentials.",1
57624,2,"Critical Behaviour of Spanning Forests on Random Planar Graphs As a follow-up of previous work of the authors, we analyse the statistical mechanics model of random spanning forests on random planar graphs. Special emphasis is given to the analysis of the critical behaviour. Exploiting an exact relation with a model of $\text{O}(-2)$ -loops and dimers, previously solved by Kostov and Staudacher, we identify critical and multicritical loci, and find them consistent with recent results of Bousquet-Mélou and Courtiel. This is also consistent with the KPZ relation, and the Berker–Kadanoff phase in the anti-ferromagnetic regime of the Potts Model on periodic lattices, predicted by Saleur. To our knowledge, this is the first known example of KPZ appearing explicitly to work within a Berker–Kadanoff phase. We set up equations for the generating function, at the value t  =  −1 of the fugacity, which is of combinatorial interest, and we investigate the resulting numerical series, a favourite problem of Tony Guttmann’s.",1

57977,2,"DNS load balancing in the CERN cloud Load Balancing is one of the technologies enabling deployment of large-scale applications on cloud resources. A DNS Load Balancer Daemon (LBD) has been developed at CERN as a cost-effective way to balance applications accepting DNS timing dynamics and not requiring persistence. It currently serves over 450 load-balanced aliases with two small VMs acting as master and slave. The aliases are mapped to DNS subdomains. These subdomains are managed with DDNS according to a load metric, which is collected from the alias member nodes with SNMP. During the last years, several improvements were brought to the software, for instance: support for IPv6, parallelization of the status requests, implementing the client in Python to allow for multiple aliases with differentiated states on the same machine or support for application state. The configuration of the Load Balancer is currently managed by a Puppet type. It discovers the alias member nodes and gets the alias definitions from the Ermis REST service. The Aiermis self-service GUI for the management of the LB aliases has been produced and is based on the Ermis service above that implements a form of Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS). The Ermis REST API has authorisation based in Foreman hostgroups. The CERN DNS LBD is Open Software with Apache 2 license.",1

58217,2,"Atmospheric multiple scattering of a vertically directed laser beam Vertical laser beams are often used at ground-based cosmic ray observatories employing the fluorescence technique for characterizing the height-dependent properties of the atmosphere, as well as for calibration and telescope alignment studies. The light flux received at a detector from a laser is typically assumed to be only singly scattered out of the beam, with no possibility for the multiple scattering of photons initially scattered in other directions back into the detector’s field of view. We present the results of a new simulation for the scattering of light from a vertically-directed laser beam, and derive a parametrization for the multiple scattered signal expected at a detector from such a source as a function of the prevailing atmospheric conditions. The parametrization is then used to estimate the increase in the reconstructed height-dependent aerosol loading when recovered using a laser-based technique.",1
58297,2,"Colored Alexander polynomials and KP hierarchy We discuss the relation between knot polynomials and the KP hierarchy. Mainly, we study the scaling 1-hook property of the coloured Alexander polynomial: $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{K}_R(q)=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{K}_{[1]}(q^{\vert R\vert})$ for all 1-hook Young diagrams $R$. Via the Kontsevich construction, it is reformulated as a system of linear equations. It appears that the solutions of this system induce the KP equations in the Hirota form. The Alexander polynomial is a specialization of the HOMFLY polynomial, and it is a kind of a dual to the double scaling limit, which gives the special polynomial, in the sense that, while the special polynomials provide solutions to the KP hierarchy, the Alexander polynomials provide the equations of this hierarchy. This gives a new connection with integrable properties of knot polynomials and puts an interesting question about the way the KP hierarchy is encoded in the full HOMFLY polynomial.",1

58364,2,"Analysing H(z) data using two-point diagnostics Measurements of the Hubble constant H(z) are increasingly being used to test the expansion rate predicted by various cosmological models. But the recent application of two-point diagnostics, such as Om() and Omh^2(z_i, z_j), has produced considerable tension between ΛCDM's predictions and several observations, with other models faring even worse. Part of this problem is attributable to the continued mixing of truly model-independent measurements using the cosmic-chronometer approach, and model-dependent data extracted from baryon acoustic oscillations. In this paper, we advance the use of two-point diagnostics beyond their current status, and introduce new variations, which we call Δh(z_i, z_j), that are more useful for model comparisons. But we restrict our analysis exclusively to cosmic-chronometer data, which are truly model independent. Even for these measurements, however, we confirm the conclusions drawn by earlier workers that the data have strongly non-Gaussian uncertainties, requiring the use of both ‘median’ and ‘mean’ statistical approaches. Our results reveal that previous analyses using two-point diagnostics greatly underestimated the errors, thereby misinterpreting the level of tension between theoretical predictions and H(z) data. Instead, we demonstrate that as of today, only Einstein–de Sitter is ruled out by the two-point diagnostics at a level of significance exceeding ∼3σ. The R_h = ct universe is slightly favoured over the remaining models, including Lambda cold dark matter and Chevalier–Polarski–Linder, though all of them (other than Einstein–de Sitter) are consistent to within 1σ with the measured mean of the Δh(z_i, z_j) diagnostics.",1
58367,2,"Curing the Self-Force Runaway Problem in Finite-Difference Integration The electromagnetic self-force equation of motion is known to be afflicted by the so-called runaway problem. A similar problem arises in the semiclassical Einstein's field equation and plagues the self-consistent semiclassical evolution of spacetime. Motivated to overcome the latter challenge, we first address the former (which is conceptually simpler), and present a pragmatic finite-difference method designed to numerically integrate the self-force equation of motion while curing the runaway problem. We restrict our attention here to a charged point-like mass in a one-dimensional motion, under a prescribed time-dependent external force $F_{ext}(t)$. We demonstrate the implementation of our method using two different examples of external force: a Gaussian and a Sin^4 function. In each of these examples we compare our numerical results with those obtained by two other methods (a Dirac-type solution and a reduction-of-order solution). Both external-force examples demonstrate a complete suppression of the undesired runaway mode, along with an accurate account of the radiation-reaction effect at the physically relevant time scale, thereby illustrating the effectiveness of our method in curing the self-force runaway problem.",1
58399,2,"Effects of two-loop contributions in the pseudofermion functional renormalization group method for quantum spin systems We implement an extension of the pseudofermion functional renormalization group method for quantum spin systems that takes into account two-loop diagrammatic contributions. An efficient numerical treatment of the additional terms is achieved within a nested graph construction which recombines different one-loop interaction channels. In order to be fully self-consistent with respect to self-energy corrections, we also include certain three-loop terms of Katanin type. We first apply this formalism to the antiferromagnetic J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice and benchmark our results against the previous one-loop plus Katanin approach. Even though the renormalization group (RG) equations undergo significant modifications when including the two-loop terms, the magnetic phase diagram, comprising Néel ordered and collinear ordered phases separated by a magnetically disordered regime, remains remarkably unchanged. Only the boundary position between the disordered and the collinear phases is found to be moderately affected by two-loop terms. On the other hand, critical RG scales, which we associate with critical temperatures Tc, are reduced by a factor of ∼2 indicating that the two-loop diagrams play a significant role in enforcing the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Improved estimates for critical temperatures are also obtained for the Heisenberg ferromagnet on the three-dimensional simple cubic lattice where errors in Tc are reduced by ∼34%. These findings have important implications for the quantum phase diagrams calculated within the previous one-loop plus Katanin approach which turn out to be already well converged.",1

We begin with the derivation of the Luttinger theorem for a Fermi liquid, using momentum balance during a process of flux insertion in a lattice electronic model with toroidal boundary conditions. We then review the TQFT of the ℤ2 spin liquid, and demonstrate its compatibility with the toroidal momentum balance argument. This discussion leads naturally to a simple construction of “topological” Fermi liquid states: the fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and the algebraic charge liquid (ACL). We present arguments for a description of the pseudogap metal of the cuprates using ℤ2−FL* or ℤ2-ACL states with Ising-nematic order. These pseudogap metal states are also described as Higgs phases of a SU(2) gauge theory. The Higgs field represents local antiferromagnetism, but the Higgs-condensed phase does not have long-range antiferromagnetic order: the magnitude of the Higgs field determines the pseudogap, the reconstruction of the Fermi surface, and the Ising-nematic order. Finally, we discuss the route to the large Fermi surface Fermi liquid via the critical point where the Higgs condensate and Ising nematic order vanish, and the application of Higgs criticality to the strange metal.",1

58939,2,"Polymer Quantization in the Bogoliubov’s Regime for a Homogeneous One-Dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate In the present report we analyze the modifications caused by the polymer quantization upon the ground state of a homogeneous one–dimensional Bose–Einstein condensate. We obtain the ground state energy of the corresponding N–body system and consequently, the corresponding speed of sound, allowing us to explore the sensitivity of the system to corrections caused by the polymer length scale. Such corrections can be enhanced for dense systems together with small values of the corresponding one–dimensional scattering length. However, these corrections remain constrained due to finite size effects of the system. The contributions of the polymer length scale to the properties of the ground state energy of the system allow us to explore, as a first approximation and when the Bogoliubov’s formalism is valid, the sensitivity of this many–body system to traces caused by the discreteness of space suggested by the polymer quantization.",1
58979,2,"Influence of the stiffness of the equation of state and in-medium effects on the cooling of compact stars Measurements of the low masses for the pulsar PSR J0737-3039B, for the companion of PSR J1756-2251 and for the companion of PSR J0453+1559, on the one hand, and of the high masses for the pulsars PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348-0432, on the other, demonstrate the existence of compact stars with masses in a broad range from 1.2 to $ 2M_{\odot}$ . The most massive ones of these objects might be hybrid stars. To fulfill the constraint $ M_{\max} > 2M_{\odot}$ with a reserve, we exploit the stiff DD2 hadronic equation of state (EoS) without and with excluded volume (DD2vex) correction, which produce maximum neutron star masses of $ M_{\max} = 2.43 M_{\odot}$ and $ 2.70 M_{\odot}$ , respectively. We show that the stiffness of the EoS does not preclude an explanation of the whole set of cooling data within “nuclear medium cooling” scenario for compact stars by a variation of the star masses. We select appropriate proton gap profiles from those exploited in the literature and allow for a variation of the effective pion gap controlling the efficiency of the medium modified Urca process. However, we suppress the possibility of pion condensation. In general, the stiffer the EoS the steeper a decrease with density of the effective pion gap is required. Results are compared with previously obtained ones for the HDD EoS for which $ M_{\max} = 2.06 M_{\odot}$ . The cooling of the compact star in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is explained mainly by an efficient medium modified Urca process. To explain a $ \gtrsim 2.5$ % decline of the cooling curve for Cas A, as motivated by an analysis of the ACIS-S instrument data, together with other cooling data exploiting the DD2 EoS a large proton gap at densities $ n \lesssim 2n_{0}$ is required vanishing for $ n\gtrsim 2.5 n_{0}$ , where $ n_{0}$ is the saturation nuclear density. A smaller decline, as it follows from an analysis of the HRC-S instrument data, is explained with many choices of parameters. With the DD2vex EoS and using an effective pion gap steeper decreasing with the density and/or a proton gap shifted to smaller densities we are also able to reproduce both a strong decline compatible with ACIS-S data and HRC-S instrument data. The mass of Cas A is estimated as 1.6- $ 1.9 M_{\odot}$ , above the value $ 1.5M_{\odot}$ , which we have evaluated with the softer HDD equation of state. Different mass choices for the hottest object XMMU J173203.3-344518 are discussed. We make general remarks also on hybrid star cooling and on its dependence on the stiffness of the hadronic EoS.",1

59022,2,"Maximum a posteriori CMB lensing reconstruction Gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a valuable cosmological signal that correlates to tracers of large-scale structure and acts as a important source of confusion for primordial B-mode polarization. State-of-the-art lensing reconstruction analyses use quadratic estimators, which are easily applicable to data. However, these estimators are known to be suboptimal, in particular for polarization, and large improvements are expected to be possible for high signal-to-noise polarization experiments. We develop a method and numerical code, lensit, that is able to find efficiently the most probable lensing map, introducing no significant approximations to the lensed CMB likelihood, and applicable to beamed and masked data with inhomogeneous noise. It works by iteratively reconstructing the primordial unlensed CMB using a deflection estimate and its inverse, and removing residual lensing from these maps with quadratic estimator techniques. Roughly linear computational cost is maintained due to fast convergence of iterative searches, combined with the local nature of lensing. The method achieves the maximal improvement in signal to noise expected from analytical considerations on the unmasked parts of the sky. Delensing with this optimal map leads to forecast tensor-to-scalar ratio parameter errors improved by a factor ≃2 compared to the quadratic estimator in a CMB stage IV configuration.",1
59086,2,"Neutron flux measurement at the Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope The characteristics of fast neutrons produced by cosmic-ray muons at the Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope (BUST) are investigated.

The processing of the data collected in 2002–2015 yielded ${N_{{{12}_B}}} = 337 \pm 2.5$ events consistent with those of the reaction$^{12}$ C(n, p)$^{12}$ B. For the BUST internal planes, the background of fast neutrons with E > 28.6 MeV is experimentally estimated as Φ ∝ 10$^{−11}$cm$^{–2}$ s$^{–1}$.

59092,2,"Acceleration in Modified Gravity (MOG) and the Mass-Discrepancy Baryonic Relation The equation of motion in the generally covariant modified gravity (MOG) theory leads for weak gravitational fields and the non-relativistic limit to a modification of the Newtonian gravitational acceleration law, expressed in terms of two parameters $\alpha$ and $\mu$. The parameter $\alpha$ determines the strength of the gravitational field and $\mu$ is the effective mass of the vector field $\phi_\mu$, coupled with gravitational strength to baryonic matter. The MOG acceleration law for weak field gravitation and non-relativistic particles has been demonstrated to fit a wide range of galaxies, galaxy clusters and the Bullet Cluster and Train Wreck Cluster mergers. We demonstrate that the MOG acceleration law for a point mass source is in agreement with the McGaugh et al., correlation between the radial acceleration traced by galaxy rotation curves and the distribution of baryonic matter for the SPARC sample of 153 rotationally supported spiral and irregular galaxies.",1
59107,2,"On Strong Gravitational Lensing in Rotating Galactic Space-times We study strong gravitational lensing in rotating space-times which can be thought of as realistic galactic models in General Relativity. To this end, using the Newman-Janis algorithm, we first obtain a rotating version of a static galactic metric advanced by Bharadwaj and Kar. This is matched with a generic external Kerr solution without a slowly-rotating approximation. Next, we construct a rotating version of Perlick's Bertrand space-times and establish this as a new rotating solution of Einstein's equations where each spatial radius admits a stable circular orbit. A rotating generalization of a strong lensing formalism due to Perlick is then applied to the rotating Bharadwaj-Kar metric and the differences with lensing in the purely Kerr background (for a Kerr black hole at the galactic center) is pointed out. Then, arguing that a rotating Bertrand space-time might be a realistic galactic model away from the galactic center, strong lensing is studied in this situation where the central singularity is naked. Possible observational signatures are elaborated upon, which might be useful in distinguishing black holes from naked singularities.",1

59201,2,"A hypothetical effect of the Maxwell-Proca electromagnetic stresses on galaxy rotation curves The Maxwell-Proca electrodynamics corresponding to a finite photon mass causes a substantial change of the Maxwell stress tensor and, under certain circumstances, may cause the electromagnetic stresses to act effectively as ""negative pressure."" The paper describes a model where this negative pressure imitates gravitational pull and may produce forces comparable to gravity and even become dominant. The effect is associated with the random magnetic fields in the galactic disk with a scale exceeding the photon Compton wavelength. The presence of a weaker regular field does not affect the forces under consideration. The stresses act predominantly on the interstellar gas and cause an additional force pulling the gas towards the center and towards the galactic plane. The stars do not experience any significant direct force but get involved in this process via a ""recycling loop"" where rapidly evolving massive stars are formed from the gas undergoing galactic rotation and then lose their masses back to the gas within a time shorter than roughly 1/6 of the rotation period. This makes their dynamics inseparable from that of the rotating gas. The lighter, slowly evolving stars, as soon as they are formed, lose connection to the gas and are confined within the galaxy only gravitationally. Numerical examples based on the parameters of our galaxy reveal both opportunities and challenges of this model and motivate further analysis. The critical issue is the plausibility of formation of the irregular magnetic field that would be force free. Another challenge is developing a predictive model of the evolution of the gaseous and stellar population of the galaxy under the aforementioned scenario. It may be interesting to also explore possible broader cosmological implications of the negative-pressure model.",1
59212,2,"Galaxy Formation Efficiency and the Multiverse Explanation of the Cosmological Constant with EAGLE Simulations Models of the very early universe, including inflationary models, are argued to produce varying universe domains with different values of fundamental constants and cosmic parameters. Using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation code from the eagle collaboration, we investigate the effect of the cosmological constant on the formation of galaxies and stars. We simulate universes with values of the cosmological constant ranging from Lambda = 0 to Lambda_0 = 300, where Lambda_0 is the value of the cosmological constant in our Universe. Because the global star formation rate in our Universe peaks at t = 3.5 Gyr, before the onset of accelerating expansion, increases in Lambda of even an order of magnitude have only a small effect on the star formation history and efficiency of the universe. We use our simulations to predict the observed value of the cosmological constant, given a measure of the multiverse. Whether the cosmological constant is successfully predicted depends crucially on the measure. The impact of the cosmological constant on the formation of structure in the universe does not seem to be a sharp enough function of Lambda to explain its observed value alone.",1

59259,2,"Pulsar Glitches in a Strangeon Star Model Pulsar-like compact stars provide us a unique laboratory to explore properties of dense matter at supra-nuclear densities. One of the models for pulsar-like stars is that they are totally composed of “strangeons”, and in this paper, we studied the pulsar glitches in a strangeon star model. Strangeon stars would be solidified during cooling, and the solid stars would be natural to have glitches as the result of starquakes. Based on the starquake model established before, we proposed that when the starquake occurs, the inner motion of the star which changes the moment of inertia and has impact on the glitch sizes, is divided into plastic flow and elastic motion. The plastic flow which is induced in the fractured part of the outer layer, would move tangentially to redistribute the matter of the star and would be hard to recover. The elastic motion, on the other hand, changes its shape and would recover significantly. Under this scenario, we could understand the behaviors of glitches without significant energy releasing, including the Crab and the Vela pulsars, in an uniform model. We derive the recovery coefficient as a function of glitch size, as well as the time interval between two successive glitches as the function of the released stress. Our results show consistency with observational data under reasonable ranges of parameters. The implications on the oblateness of the Crab and the Vela pulsars are discussed.",1
59339,2,"The renormalization method based on the Taylor expansion and applications for asymptotic analysis Based on the Taylor expansion, we propose a renormalization method for asymptotic analysis. The standard renormalization group (RG) method for asymptotic analysis can be derived out from this new method, and hence the mathematical essence of the RG method is also recovered. The biggest advantage of the proposed method is that the secular terms in perturbation series are automatically eliminated, but in usual perturbation theory, we need more efforts and tricks to eliminate these terms. At the same time, the mathematical foundation of the method is simple and the logic of the method is very clear, therefore, it is very easy in practice. As application, we obtain the uniform valid asymptotic solutions to some problems including vector field, boundary layer and boundary value problems of nonlinear wave equations. Moreover, we discuss the normal form theory and reduction equations of dynamical systems. Furthermore, by combining the topological deformation and the RG method, a modified method namely the homotopy renormalization method (for simplicity, HTR) wasproposed to overcome the weaknesses of the standard RG method. In this HTR method, since there is a freedom to choose the first order approximate solution in perturbation expansion, we can improve the global solution. In particular, for those equations including no a small parameter, the HTR method can also be applied. Some concrete applications including multi-solutions problems, the forced Duffing equation and the Blasius equation are given.",1
59341,2,"Scientific Realism and Primordial Cosmology We discuss scientific realism from the perspective of modern cosmology, especially primordial cosmology: i.e. the cosmological investigation of the very early universe. We first (Section 2) state our allegiance to scientific realism, and discuss what insights about it cosmology might yield, as against ""just"" supplying scientific claims that philosophers can then evaluate. In particular, we discuss: the idea of laws of cosmology, and limitations on ascertaining the global structure of spacetime. Then we review some of what is now known about the early universe (Section 3): meaning, roughly, from a thousandth of a second after the Big Bang onwards(!). The rest of the paper takes up two issues about primordial cosmology, i.e. the very early universe, where ""very early"" means, roughly, much earlier (logarithmically) than one second after the Big Bang: say, less than $10^{-11}$ seconds. Both issues illustrate that familiar philosophical threat to scientific realism, the under-determination of theory by data---on a cosmic scale. The first issue (Section 4) concerns the difficulty of observationally probing the very early universe. More specifically, the difficulty is to ascertain details of the putative inflationary epoch. The second issue (Section 5) concerns difficulties about confirming a cosmological theory that postulates a multiverse, i.e. a set of domains (universes) each of whose inhabitants (if any) cannot directly observe, or otherwise causally interact with, other domains. This again concerns inflation, since many inflationary models postulate a multiverse. For all these issues, it will be clear that much remains unsettled, as regards both physics and philosophy.

The electrons are injected into the ion bubble from the sides of it and then accelerated by the wakefield. Contrary to the conventional wave breaking model, the injection of monoenergetic electrons are mainly caused by the electromagnetic process. A simple model was proposed to address the instability, and the growth rate was verified numerically and theoretically.",1
59401,2,"New estimation method of neutron skyshine for a high-energy particle accelerator A skyshine is the dominant component of the prompt radiation at off-site. Several experimental studies have been done to estimate the neutron skyshine at a few accelerator facilities. In this work, the neutron transports from a source place to off-site location were simulated using the Monte Carlo codes, FLUKA and PHITS. The transport paths were classified as skyshine, direct (transport), groundshine and multiple-shine to understand the contribution of each path and to develop a general evaluation method. The effect of each path was estimated in the view of the dose at far locations. The neutron dose was calculated using the neutron energy spectra obtained from each detector placed up to a maximum of 1 km from the accelerator. The highest altitude of the sky region in this simulation was set as 2 km from the floor of the accelerator facility. The initial model of this study was the 10 GeV electron accelerator, PAL-XFEL. Different compositions and densities of air, soil and ordinary concrete were applied in this calculation, and their dependences were reviewed. The estimation method used in this study was compared with the well-known methods suggested by Rindi, Stevenson and Stepleton, and also with the simple code, SHINE3. The results obtained using this method agreed well with those using Rindi’s formula.",1
59489,2,"Symmetry enriched U(1) quantum spin liquids We classify and characterize three-dimensional U(1) quantum spin liquids [deconfined U(1) gauge theories] with global symmetries. These spin liquids have an emergent gapless photon and emergent electric/magnetic excitations (which we assume are gapped). We first discuss in great detail the case with time-reversal and SO(3) spin rotational symmetries. We find there are 15 distinct such quantum spin liquids based on the properties of bulk excitations. We show how to interpret them as gauged symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs). Some of these states possess fractional response to an external SO(3) gauge field, due to which we dub them “fractional topological paramagnets.” We identify 11 other anomalous states that can be grouped into three anomaly classes. The classification is further refined by weakly coupling these quantum spin liquids to bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with the same symmetry. This refinement does not modify the bulk excitation structure but modifies universal surface properties. Taking this refinement into account, we find there are 168 distinct such U(1) quantum spin liquids. After this warm-up, we provide a general framework to classify symmetry enriched U(1) quantum spin liquids for a large class of symmetries. As a more complex example, we discuss U(1) quantum spin liquids with time-reversal and Z2 symmetries in detail. Based on the properties of the bulk excitations, we find there are 38 distinct such spin liquids that are anomaly-free. There are also 37 anomalous U(1) quantum spin liquids with this symmetry. Finally, we briefly discuss the classification of U(1) quantum spin liquids enriched by some other symmetries.",1

59530,2,"Central MONDian spike in spherically symmetric systems Under a MONDian view, astrophysical systems are expected to follow Newtonian dynamics whenever the local acceleration is above the critical a_0 = 1.2 × 10^−10 m s^−2, and enter a modified regime for accelerations below this critical value. Indeed, the dark matter phenomenology on galactic and subgalactic scales appears always, and only, at low accelerations. It is standard to find the a < a_0 regime towards the low density outskirts of astronomical systems, where under a Newtonian interpretation, dark matter becomes conspicuous. Thus, it is standard to find, and to think, of the dense central regions of observed systems as purely Newtonian. However, under spherical symmetry in the MONDian as in the Newtonian case, the local acceleration will tend to zero as one approaches the very centre of a mass distribution. It is clear that for spherically symmetric systems, an inner a < a_0 region will necessarily appear interior to a critical radius, which will depend on the details of the density profile in question. Here, we calculate analytically such a critical radius for a constant-density core, and numerically for a cored isothermal profile. Under a Newtonian interpretation, such a central MONDian region will be interpreted as extra mass, analogous to the controversial black holes sometimes inferred to lie at the centres of globular clusters, despite an absence of nuclear activity detected to date. We calculate this effect and give predictions for the ‘central black hole’ mass to be expected under Newtonian interpretations of low density Galactic globular clusters.",1
59568,2,"Symmetries of Trautman retarded radial coordinates We consider spacetime described by an observer that uses a Trautman retarded radial coordinate system. Given a metric tensor, we find all the local symmetries of the coordinates. They set a 10D family that can be parametrized by Poincaré algebra. This result is similar to the symmetries of an observer using the Gaussian normal spacetime radial coordinates and experiencing algebra deformation induced by the spacetime Riemann tensor. A new, surprising property of the retarded coordinates is a generic lack of smoothness in the symmetries. We show that, in general, the symmetries are not twice differentiable. In other words, a family of smooth symmetries is smaller than in the Gaussian normal spacetime coordinate case. We demonstrate examples of that non-smoothness and find the necessary conditions for the differentiability to the second order. We also discuss the consequences and relevance of that result for the geometric relational observables program. One can interpret our result by the fact that Trautman coordinates provide gauge conditions stronger than the Gaussian spacetime radial gauge.",1

We construct explicitly the first-order deformation of the so-called `orthotoric metric' on this manifold. We also show that the deformation of the corresponding conformal Killing-Yano form does not exist.,1
59595,2,"A Model-Building Approach to the Origin of Flavor In this thesis we link the recent anomalies reported in B meson and h → µτ decays to
the smallness of neutrino masses and aspects of the flavor puzzle, including the hierarchy
of the Yukawa couplings and the disparate fermion mixings. By formulating various
new models we attempt to shed light on the potential common origin of the distinct
measurements in the flavor sector. To this end, discrete symmetries are utilized in this
work as the governing principle behind all fermion interactions. The first two models
based on the S3 and the A4 symmetry, respectively, aim to unify the diverse fermion
masses and mixings. Special features separate the frameworks from the flavor models
in the literature that often lack testable predictions. While the first model provides
interesting flavor-violating signatures in top quark decays, the second one ties the flavor
to the grand unification scale in a novel way. In the three following models we focus on
the anomalies that hint at lepton flavor and universality violation. We propose that the
large flavor violation observed in h → µτ decays is dictated by the scalar mixing of an
enlarged S4-symmetric Higgs sector. By constructing two leptoquark models we show
for the first time that leptoquark couplings shaped by a Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism
can accommodate the B meson anomalies and simultaneously generate naturally-small
neutrino masses. Emphasizing the importance of testability, we demonstrate how these
models can be probed by future diphoton resonances, using the recent 750 GeV excess
as an example scenario.",1

59601,2,"Suppression of Half-Integer Resonance in Fermilab Booster The particle losses at injection in the FNAL Booster are
one of the major factors limiting the machine performance.
The losses are caused by motion nonlinearity due to direct

transverse instabilities. The report aims to address the former
- the suppression of incoherent space charge effects by
reducing deviations from the perfect periodicity of linear
optics functions. It should be achieved by high accuracy
optics measurements with subsequent optics correction and
by removing known sources of optics perturbations. The

59649,2,"Stability of mass transfer from massive giants: double black hole binary formation and ultraluminous X-ray sources Mass transfer in binaries with massive donors and compact companions, when the donors rapidly evolve after their main sequence, determines the formation rates of merging double stellar-mass black hole (BH) binaries formed outside clusters. This mass transfer was previously postulated to be unstable and was expected to lead to a common envelope event. The common envelope event then ends with either the merger of the two stars or formation of a binary that eventually may become a merging double BH. We revisit the stability of this mass transfer and find an unanticipated third outcome: for a large range of binary orbital separations, this mass transfer is stable. This newly found stability allows us to reconcile the empirical rate obtained by LIGO, 9-240 Gpc^−3 yr^−1, with the theoretical rate for double BH binary mergers predicted by population synthesis studies by excluding a channel that predicts a merger rate above 1000 Gpc^−3 yr^−1. Furthermore, the stability of the mass transfer leads to the formation of ultraluminous X-ray sources. The theoretically predicted formation rates of bright ultraluminous X-ray sources powered by a stellar-mass BH are high enough to explain the number of observed bright ultraluminous X-ray sources.",1

59740,2,"Post-Newtonian parameter γ in generalized non-local gravity We investigate the post-Newtonian parameter γ and derive its formalism in generalized non-local (GNL) gravity, which is the modified theory of general relativity (GR) obtained by adding a term m$^{2}^{n}^{−2}$ R☐$^{−n}$ R to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Concretely, based on parametrizing the generalized non-local action in which gravity is described by a series of dynamical scalar fields ϕ$^{i}$ in addition to the metric tensor g$_{μν}$, the post-Newtonian limit is computed, and the effective gravitational constant as well as the post-Newtonian parameters are directly obtained from the generalized non-local gravity. Moreover, by discussing the values of the parametrized post-Newtonian parameters γ, we can compare our expressions and results with those in Hohmann and Järv et al. (2016), as well as current observational constraints on the values of γ in Will (2006). Hence, we draw restrictions on the nonminimal coupling terms F̅ around their background values.",1
59741,2,"The $^{7}$Be(n,p)$^{7}$Li reaction and the Cosmological Lithium Problem: measurement of the cross section in a wide energy range at n_TOF (CERN) We report on the measurement of the $^{7}$Be($n, p$)$^{7}$Li cross section from thermal to approximately 325 keV neutron energy, performed in the high-flux experimental area (EAR2) of the n_TOF facility at CERN. This reaction plays a key role in the lithium yield of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) for standard cosmology. The only two previous time-of-flight measurements performed on this reaction did not cover the energy window of interest for BBN, and showed a large discrepancy between each other. The measurement was performed with a Si-telescope, and a high-purity sample produced by implantation of a $^{7}$Be ion beam at the ISOLDE facility at CERN. While a significantly higher cross section is found at low-energy, relative to current evaluations, in the region of BBN interest the present results are consistent with the values inferred from the time-reversal $^{7}$Li($p, n$)$^{7}$Be reaction, thus yielding only a relatively minor improvement on the so-called Cosmological Lithium Problem (CLiP). The relevance of these results on the near-threshold neutron production in the p+$^{7}$Li reaction is also discussed.",1
59764,2,"Neutron-proton pairing and double-$\beta$ decay in the interacting boson model Background: The interacting boson model has been used extensively to calculate the matrix elements governing neutrinoless double-β decay. Studies within other models—the shell model, the quasiparticle random-phase approximation, and nuclear energy-density functional theory—indicate that a good description of neutron-proton pairing is essential for accurate calculations of those matrix elements, even though the isotopes used in experiment have significantly more neutrons than protons. The usual interacting boson model is based only on like-particle pairs, however, and the extent to which it captures neutron-proton pairing is not clear. Purpose: To determine whether neutron-proton pairing should be explicitly included as neutron-proton bosons in interacting-boson-model calculations of neutrinoless double-β decay matrix elements. In this paper we restrict ourselves to nuclei in the lower half of the pf shell, where exact shell model calculations are possible. Method: An isospin-invariant version of the nucleon-pair shell model is applied to carry out shell-model calculations in a large space and in a collective subspace, and to define effective operators in the latter. A democratic mapping is then used to define corresponding boson operators for the interacting boson model, with and without an isoscalar neutron-proton pair boson. Results: Interacting-boson-model calculations with and without the isoscalar boson are carried out for nuclei near the beginning of the pf shell, with a realistic shell-model Hamiltonian and neutrinoless double-β-decay operator as the starting point. Energy spectra and double-β matrix elements are compared to those obtained in the underlying shell model. Conclusions: The isoscalar boson is not important for energy spectra but improves the results for the double-β matrix elements. To be useful at the level of precision we need, the mapping procedure must be further developed to better determine the dependence of the boson Hamiltonian and decay operator on particle number and isospin, and extended to heavier nuclei. The benefits provided by the isoscalar boson in the nuclei examined here, however, suggest that through an appropriate combination of mappings and fitting, it would make interacting-boson-model matrix elements more accurate in the heavier nuclei used in experiments.",1
59790,2,"Characterization of THGEM coupled to submillimetric induction gaps in Ne/CH$_4$ and Ar/CH$_4$ mixtures The coupling of a THGEM to an induction region having a thickness below 1 mm allows the application of intense induction electric fields, resulting in a more efficient extraction of the avalanche electrons into the anode electrode and the extension of the charge avalanche amplification into the induction region. In the present work, we investigate the performance of such configuration, operating in Ne-5% CH(4) and Ar-20% CH(4) mixtures, in terms of gain characteristics and energy resolution for 5.9 keV X-rays. Gains above 10(5) can be achieved in both mixtures without jeopardizing the energy resolution for induction gaps of 0.8 and 0.5 mm, while applying lower biasing voltages to the THGEM. We have demonstrated that it is possible to implement gas electron multiplier configurations having an effective reduction of its thickness and that high gains can be achieved in Ar-based mixtures having CH(4) concentrations as high as 20%. Ar based mixtures present higher ionization yields and lower electron diffusion coefficients, when compared to Ne-based ones.",1

The matching conditions are acquired by considering a spherically symmetric non-static (n + 2)-dimensional metric in the inner region and Schwarzschild (n + 2)-dimensional metric in the outer region of the star. To solve the field equations for above settings in f(R, T) gravity, we choose the stress–energy tensor trace and the Ricci scalar as constants.

Extrinsic curvatures of the surface swept by the shell are calculated in both coordinate systems. Applications to the Israel junction conditions are discussed.,1
59991,2,"Reconstruction of the HII Galaxy Hubble Diagram using Gaussian Processes The Hubble diagram constructed using HII galaxies (HIIGx) and Giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHR) as standard candles already extends beyond the current reach of Type Ia SNe. A sample of 156 HIIGx and GEHR sources has been used previously to compare the predictions of ΛCDM and Rh = ct, the results of which suggested that the HIIGx and GEHR sources strongly favour the latter over the former. But this analysis was based on the application of parametric fits to the data and the use of information criteria, which disfavour the less parsimonious models. In this paper, we advance the use of HII sources as standard candles by utilizing Gaussian processes (GP) to reconstruct the distance modulus representing these data without the need to pre-assume any particular model, none of which may in the end actually be the correct cosmology. In addition, this approach tightly constrains the 1σ confidence region of the reconstructed function, thus providing a better tool with which to differentiate between competing cosmologies. With this approach, we show that the Planck concordance model is in tension with the HII data at more than 2.5σ, while Rh = ct agrees with the GP reconstruction very well, particularly at redshifts  10−3.",1

60052,2,"Neutron Stars in the Laboratory Neutron stars are astrophysical laboratories of many extremes of physics. Their rich phenomenology provides insights into the state and composition of matter at densities which cannot be reached in terrestrial experiments. Since the core of a mature neutron star is expected to be dominated by superfluid and superconducting components, observations also probe the dynamics of large-scale quantum condensates. The testing and understanding of the relevant theory tend to focus on the interface between the astrophysics phenomenology and nuclear physics. The connections with low-temperature experiments tend to be ignored. However, there has been dramatic progress in understanding laboratory condensates (from the different phases of superfluid helium to the entire range of superconductors and cold atom condensates). In this review, we provide an overview of these developments, compare and contrast the mathematical descriptions of laboratory condensates and neutron stars and summarize the current experimental state-of-the-art. This discussion suggests novel ways that we may make progress in understanding neutron star physics using low-temperature laboratory experiments.",1
60101,2,"Anomalous Nernst and Thermal Hall Effects in Tilted Weyl Semimetals We study the anomalous Nernst and thermal Hall effects in a linearized low-energy model of a tilted Weyl semimetal, with two Weyl nodes separated in momentum space. For inversion symmetric tilt, we give analytic expressions in two opposite limits: For a small tilt, corresponding to a type-I Weyl semimetal, the Nernst conductivity is finite and independent of the Fermi level; for a large tilt, corresponding to a type-II Weyl semimetal, it acquires a contribution depending logarithmically on the Fermi energy. This result is in a sharp contrast to the nontilted case, where the Nernst response is known to be zero in the linear model. The thermal Hall conductivity similarly acquires Fermi surface contributions, which add to the Fermi level-independent, zero-tilt result, and is suppressed as one over the tilt parameter at half filling in the type-II phase. In the case of inversion-breaking tilt, with the tilting vector of equal modulus in the two Weyl cones, all Fermi surface contributions to both anomalous responses cancel out, resulting in zero Nernst conductivity. We discuss two possible experimental setups, representing open and closed thermoelectric circuits.",1

Both the two methods indicate the breakdown events happened at the end of the linac and more likely in the first or the second load cell.",1

On February 11, 2017, the radiation detectors recorded gamma-ray emission lasting for 75 sec. The gamma-ray spectrum extended up to 20 MeV and was reproduced by a cutoff power-law model with a photon index of $1.36^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$, being consistent with a Bremsstrahlung radiation from a thundercloud (as known as a gamma-ray glow and a thunderstorm ground enhancement). Then the gamma-ray glow was abruptly terminated with a nearby lightning discharge. The low-frequency radio monitors, installed $\sim$50 km away from the gamma-ray observation site recorded leader development of an intra/inter-cloud discharge spreading over $\sim$60 km area with a $\sim$300 ms duration. The timing of the gamma-ray termination coincided with the moment when the leader development of the intra/inter-cloud discharge passed 0.7 km horizontally away from the radiation monitors. The intra/inter-cloud discharge started $\sim$15 km away from the gamma-ray observation site. Therefore, the glow was terminated by the leader development, while it did not trigger the lightning discharge in the present case.",1

Alternative approaches have to pass a number of observational tests including one with distant type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. As it was shown [1] a conformal cosmological (CC) approach can explain cosmological SNe Ia data without introducing Λ-term, however, introducing an exotic rigid equation of state is needed.

60371,2,"Topological classification of crystalline insulators through band structure combinatorics We present a method for efficiently enumerating all allowed, topologically distinct, electronic band structures within a given crystal structure in all physically relevant dimensions. The algorithm applies to crystals without time-reversal, particle-hole, chiral, or any other anticommuting or anti-unitary symmetries. The results presented match the mathematical structure underlying the topological classification of these crystals in terms of K-theory and therefore elucidate this abstract mathematical framework from a simple combinatorial perspective. Using a straightforward counting procedure, we classify all allowed topological phases of spinless particles in crystals in class A. Employing this classification, we study transitions between topological phases within class A that are driven by band inversions at high-symmetry points in the first Brillouin zone. This enables us to list all possible types of phase transitions within a given crystal structure and to identify whether or not they give rise to intermediate Weyl semimetallic phases.",1

In this design, a 50-kA conductor-on-round-core cable-in-conduit conductor utilizing ReBCO technology is envisioned, operating at 40 K. Various properties such as resistivity, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity are very different at this temperature, which affects the quench behavior. It is found that the envisioned conductor is very stable with a minimum quench energy of about 2 kJ. However, the quench propagation velocity is typically about 20 mm/s, so that creating a wide-spread normal zone throughout the coil is very challenging. Moreover, an extraction voltage exceeding 20 kV would be required to ensure a hot-spot temperature below 100 K once a thermal runaway occurs. A novel concept dubbed “rapid quench transformation” is proposed whereby the superconducting conductor is co-wound with a normal conductor to achieve a high degree of inductive coupling. This geometry allows for a significant electric noise reduction, thus enabling low-threshold quench detection. The secondary circuit is connected in series with a stack of diodes, not allowing current transfer during regular operation, but very fast current transfer once a quench is detected. With this approach, the hot-spot temperature can be kept within 20 K of the cold mass temperature at all times, the hot-spot temperature is well below 100 K, and just under 80% of the stored energy can be extracted during a quench.",1

By using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations, we find that the lowest excitations have a dynamical exponent z that varies from 2 to 3.2 as we vary a coupling in the Hamiltonian. We find an additional gapless mode with a continuously varying exponent 2≤z<2.7, which establishes the presence of multiple dynamics. In order to explain these striking properties, we construct a continuum wave function for the ground state, which correctly describes the correlations and entanglement properties. We also give a continuum parent Hamiltonian, but show that additional ingredients are needed to capture the excitations of the chain. By using an exact mapping to the nonequilibrium dynamics of a classical spin chain, we find that the large dynamical exponent is due to subdiffusive spin motion. Finally, we discuss the connections to other spin chains and to a family of quantum critical models in two dimensions.",1
60524,2,"Why Boltzmann Brains Are Bad Some modern cosmological models predict the appearance of Boltzmann Brains: observers who randomly fluctuate out of a thermal bath rather than naturally evolving from a low-entropy Big Bang. A theory in which most observers are of the Boltzmann Brain type is generally thought to be unacceptable, although opinions differ. I argue that such theories are indeed unacceptable: the real problem is with fluctuations into observers who are locally identical to ordinary observers, and their existence cannot be swept under the rug by a choice of probability distributions over observers. The issue is not that the existence of such observers is ruled out by data, but that the theories that predict them are cognitively unstable: they cannot simultaneously be true and justifiably believed.",1
60544,2,"Darboux–Bäcklund transformations, dressing & impurities in multi-component NLS We consider the discrete and continuous vector non-linear Schrödinger (NLS) model. We focus on the case where space-like local discontinuities are present, and we are primarily interested in the time evolution on the defect point. This in turn yields the time part of a typical Darboux–Bäcklund transformation. Within this spirit we then explicitly work out the generic Bäcklund transformation and the dressing associated to both discrete and continuous spectrum, i.e. the Darboux transformation is expressed in the matrix and integral representation respectively.",1
60570,2,"Beam profile monitor for intense, negative, hydrogen-ion beams in the J-PARC linac Tracking the beam halo and its growth are essential to mitigate the beam dynamics problem in high-current accelerators. In the J-PARC linac, a beam halo has been reported to appear at the place of a mismatched magnet and/or an inaccurately set cavity. The beam loss becomes more significant as the beam’s output power increases. We developed a sensitive wire scanner monitor (WSM) to measure the transverse root-mean-squared (RMS) size of a negative hydrogen-ion beam for the transverse matching between quadrupole magnets. Although the dynamic range of 10$^{+2}$ is sufficient to evaluate the RMS beam size, we set a dynamic range goal of 10$^{+4}$ because we intend to observe the beam halo at the same time. We achieved a dynamic range over 10$^{+4}$ by selecting a proper combination of wire material and diameter by considering the interactions between the beam and the wires. This enabled a measurement of the beam halo evolution in the linac. We discuss the mechanism that enabled the wider dynamic range compared with proton-beam WSMs. In addition, we propose a new chopper-phase-tuning method, which is realized because of the wide dynamic range of the WSM. This method may provide an accurate tuning scheme for not only the present operation but also the high-peak beam-current operation of the linac.",1
60583,2,"An entropy for groups of intermediate growth One of the few accepted dynamical foundations of nonadditive (“nonextensive”) statistical mechanics is that the choice of the appropriate entropy functional describing a system with many degrees of freedom should reflect the rate of growth of its configuration or phase space volume. We present an example of a group, as a metric space, that may be used as the phase space of a system whose ergodic behavior is statistically described by the recently proposed -entropy. This entropy is a one-parameter variation of the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon functional and is quite different, in form, from the power-law entropies that have been recently studied. We use the first Grigorchuk group for our purposes. We comment on the connections of the above construction with the conjectured evolution of the underlying system in phase space.",1
60661,2,"Numerical studies of density transition injection in laser wakefield acceleration The quality of laser wakefield accelerated electrons beams is strongly determined by the physical mechanism exploited to inject electrons in the wakefield. One of the techniques used to improve the beam quality is the density transition injection, where the electron trapping occurs as the laser pulse passes a sharp density transition created in the plasma. Although this technique has been widely demonstrated experimentally, the literature lacks theoretical and numerical studies on the effects of all the transition parameters. We thus report and discuss the results of a series of particle in cell (PIC) simulations where the density transition height and downramp length are systematically varied, to show how the electron beam parameters and the injection mechanism are affected by the density transition parameters.",1
60711,2,"Fractional angular momentum at topological insulator interfaces Recently two fundamental topological properties of a magnetic vortex at the interface of a superconductor (SC) and a strong topological insulator (TI) have been established: the vortex carries both a Majorana zero-mode relevant for topological quantum computation and, for a time-reversal invariant TI, a charge of $e/4$. This fractional charge is caused by the axion term in the electromagnetic Lagrangian of the TI. Here we determine the angular momentum $J$ of the vortices, which in turn determines their mutual statistics. Solving the axion-London electrodynamic equations including screening in both SC and TI, we find that the elementary quantum of angular momentum of the vortex is $-n^2\hbar/8$, where $n$ is the flux quantum of the vortex line. Exchanging two elementary fluxes thus changes the phase of the wavefunction by $-\pi/4$.",1
60743,2,"Properties of strongly magnetized ultradense matter and its effects on magnetar pulsations We investigate the effect of strong magnetic fields on the adiabatic radial oscillations of hadronic stars. We describe magnetized hadronic matter within the framework of the relativistic nonlinear Walecka model and integrate the equations of relativistic radial oscillations to determine the fundamental pulsation mode. We consider that the magnetic field increases, in a density dependent way, from the surface, where it has a typical magnetar value of 1015G, to the interior of the star, where it can be as large as 3×1018G. We show that magnetic fields of the order of 1018G at the stellar core produce a significant change in the frequency of neutron star pulsations with respect to unmagnetized objects. If radial pulsations are excited in magnetar flares, they can leave an imprint in the flare lightcurves and open a new window for the study of highly magnetized ultradense matter.",1

Distinguished from the familiar Ramsey interference fringes with the concentric rings under two identical-handedness fields, however, the finding vortices are associated to the interference between the pair production amplitudes of these two opposite-handedness fields. Moreover, the sensitive dependence of vortex patterns on the relative carrier envelope phase, the time delay, and the handedness between two fields imply also a new way to detect the applied laser field characteristics.",1

The injection condition, injection threshold as well as the injection length can be given theoretically by our model and are compared with results from computer simulations.

61004,2,"Future Prospects of RF Hadron Beam Profile Monitors for Intense Neutrino Beam A novel beam monitor based on a gas-filled RF resonator is proposed to measure the precise profile of secondary particles downstream of a target in the LBNF beam line at high intensity. The RF monitor is so simple that it promises to be radiation robust in extremely high-radiation environment. When a charged beam passes through a gas-filled microwave RF cavity, it produces electron-ion pairs in the RF cavity. The induced plasma changes the gas permittivity in proportion to the beam intensity. The permittivity shift can be measured by the modulated RF frequency and quality factor. The beam profile can thus be reconstructed from the signals from individual RF cavity pixels built into the beam profile monitor. A demonstration test is underway, and the current results has shown technical feasibility. The next phase consists of two stages, (1) to build and test a new multi-cell 2.45 GHz RF cavity that can be used for the NuMI beamline, and (2) to build and test a new multi-cell 9.3 GHz RF cavity that can be put in service in a future beamline at the LBNF for spatial resolution. These two resonant frequencies are chosen since they are the standard frequencies for magnetron RF source.",1
61038,2,"Observational Signature of Near-extremal Kerr-MOG Black Hole at the Event Horizon Telescope We study the shadows cast by near-extremal Kerr-MOG black holes for different values of the parameter in modified gravity (MOG). In particular, we consider an isotropic emitter orbiting near such black holes and analytically compute the positions, fluxes and redshift factors of their images. The size of the shadow decreases when the modified parameter is increased. For each shadow, the images of the emitter appear on a special part of the shadow which has a rich structure. The primary image and secondary images are similar to those produced for the near-extremal (high spin) Kerr black hole, but the near-extremal Kerr-MOG black hole can have a spin ($\hat{J}/M^2_{\alpha}$) which is finitely lower than 1. When the modified parameter is varied, the typical positions of the corresponding images do not change, nor does the typical redshift factor associated with the primary image. However, another typical redshift factor associated with the secondary image increases when the modified parameter is increased. We also find that the fluxes increase in that case. These images appear periodically with period greater than that of Kerr. This provides an alternative signature away from the Kerr case which may be tested by the Event Horizon Telescope.",1

61123,2,"Multiple-photon disambiguation on stripline-anode Micro-Channel Plates Large-Area Picosecond Photo-Detectors (LAPPDs) show great potential for expanding the performance envelope of Micro-Channel Plates (MCPs) to areas of up to 20 x 20 cm and larger. Such scaling introduces new challenges, including how to meet the electronics readout burden of ever larger area MCPs. One solution is to replace the traditional grid anode used for readout with a microwave stripline anode, thus allowing the channel count to scale with MCP width rather than area. However, stripline anodes introduce new issues not commonly dealt with in grid-anodes, especially as their length increases. One of these issues is the near simultaneous arrival of multiple photons on the detector, creating possible confusion about how to reconstruct their arrival times and positions. We propose a maximum a posteriori solution to the problem and verify its performance in simulated scintillator and water-Cherenkov detectors.",1

We discuss scales of the theory in the stellar energy region where the$^{12}$C( $\alpha$ , $ \gamma$ )$^{16}$O process occurs, and then obtain an expression of the elastic scattering amplitudes in terms of effective-range parameters. Using experimental data of the phase shifts for l = 0, 1, 2 channels at low energies, for which the resonance regions are avoided, we fix values of the parameters and find that the phase shifts at the low energies are well reproduced by using three effective-range parameters for each channel. Furthermore, we discuss problems and uncertainties of the present approach when the amplitudes are extrapolated to the stellar energy region.",1
61277,2,"Was there an early reionization component in our universe? A deep understanding of the epoch of reionization is still missing in our knowledge of the universe. While future probes will allow us to test the precise evolution of the free electron fraction from redshifts between z 6 and 0z 2, at present one could ask what kind of reionization processes are allowed by present cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization measurements. An early contribution to reionization could imply a departure from the standard picture where star formation determines the reionization onset. By considering a broad class of possible reionization parameterizations, we find that current data do not require an early reionization component in our universe and that only one marginal class of models, based on a particular realization of reionization, may point to that. In addition, the frequentist Akaike information criterion (AIC) provides strong evidence against alternative reionization histories, favoring the most simple reionization scenario, which describes reionization by means of only one (constant) reionization optical depth τ.",1
61394,2,"Automated Finite State Workflow for Distributed Data Production In statistically hungry science domains, data deluges can be both a blessing and a curse. They allow the narrowing of statistical errors from known measurements, and open the door to new scientific opportunities as research programs mature. They are also a testament to the efficiency of experimental operations. However, growing data samples may need to be processed with little or no opportunity for huge increases in computing capacity. A standard strategy has thus been to share resources across multiple experiments at a given facility. Another has been to use middleware that “glues” resources across the world so they are able to locally run the experimental software stack (either natively or virtually). We describe a framework STAR has successfully used to reconstruct a ~400 TB dataset consisting of over 100,000 jobs submitted to a remote site in Korea from STAR's Tier 0 facility at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The framework automates the full workflow, taking raw data files from tape and writing Physics-ready output back to tape without operator or remote site intervention.

The high efficiency is attributed to finite state checking with retries to encourage resilience in the system over capricious and fallible infrastructure.",1

We show that the UV effects are irrelevant in the evolution of the oscillating part, while they play a crucial role in reproducing the smooth component. Our 'extractor' operator can be applied to simulations and real data in order to extract the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) without any fitting function and nuisance parameter. We conclude that the nonlinear evolution of BAO can be accurately reproduced at all scales down to 0z= by our fast analytical method, without any need of extra parameters fitted from simulations.",1
61535,2,"Measurement and analysis of the impact of transverse incoherent wakefields in a light source storage ring The influence of incoherent wakefields arising from a high current beam circulating in a ring composed of many flat chambers on the beam is analyzed numerically and experimentally for the SOLEIL storage ring. Three distinct ranges of the excited field are studied: the long multiturn regime in multibunch fillings, the medium regime involving neighboring bunches, and the short intrabunch regime. Two theoretical models, which both take into account the field diffusion across chamber walls of finite thickness, are employed to compare the measurement with theoretical expectations. Specific experimental methods, based respectively upon orbit analysis, bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback and a single particle betatron resonance, are introduced to measure the incoherent focusing effect in the three regimes.

The configuration space is 11 dimensional but simplifies significantly after factoring out the overall spin and isospin degrees of freedom. We exactly solve the free quantum problem and then include an interaction potential between the Skyrmions numerically. The resulting energy spectrum is compared to the corresponding nuclei—the helium-5/lithium-5 isodoublet. We find approximate parity doubling not seen in the experimental data.

One of the particles is critical (with fine-tuned parameters) and moves in the outward direction. The second particle (usual, not fine-tuned) comes from infinity. We examine the efficiency η of the collisional Penrose process. There are two relevant cases here: a particle falling into a black hole after collision (i) is heavy or (ii) has a finite mass. We show that the maximum of η in case (ii) is less than or equal to that in case (i). It is argued that for superheavy particles, the bound applies to nonequatorial motion as well. As an example, we analyze collision in the Kerr-Newman background. When the bound is the same for processes (i) and (ii), η=3 for this metric.

62046,2,"Funneling electron beams from Gallium Arsenide photocathodes Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is the most widely used source of polarized
electrons around the world. Electrons are extracted from a
GaAs surface, terminated by a cesium-oxygen layer. The electrons
are accelerated to form a beam by a DC electric field. This beam
can ionize residual gas in the chamber, and the DC field accelerates
the resulting ions into the cathode surface, damaging the CesiumOxygen
layer. This process, called Ion Back Bombardment, is the
dominant mechanism for limiting photocathode lifetime. As a result,
high average current operation yields charge lifetimes too low
to be used in a collider design.
One idea to extend the charge lifetime is to combine the beams from
multiple cathodes using a rotating magnetic field
if operation
of one cathode does not a↵ect the operation of another cathode
in the same chamber, then the source’s lifetime can be extended
by simply adding more cathodes. This dissertation presents the
design, construction and commissioning of a unique electron gun
capable of operating twenty cathodes. Results of combining two electron beams with a rotating magnetic field are also presented.
For average currents at 175 nA and 350 nA, the charge lifetimes

showing that the charge lifetime for two beam combination is the
sum of the individual ion back bombardment charge lifetimes. The
addition of charge lifetime implies that beam combination can be
used to increase charge lifetime by an order of magnitude.",1

The kinematic requirements that should be satisfied in order to isolate 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes are derived. We demonstrate that the sequence of two short-range NN interactions represents the main mechanism. Within this mechanism we predict a quadratic dependence of the inclusive cross section ratios of nuclei to $^3$He in the 3N-SRC region to the same ratio measured in 2N-SRC domain. The first analysis of the available data satisfying the necessary 3N-SRC kinematical conditions is presented. This analysis provides tantalizing signatures of scaling associated with the onset of 3N-SRCs. The same data are also consistent with the prediction of the quadratic relation between the ratios measured in the 3N and 2N-SRC regions for nuclei ranging $4 \le A \le 197$. This agreement made it possible to extract $a_3(A)$, the probability of 3N-SRCs relative to the $^3$He nucleus. For $a_3(A)$ we obtain noticeably larger magnitudes than for the analogous parameter, $a_2(A)$ for 2N-SRCs.",1

We model the density-density correlation function, takinginto account both quantum fluctuations and the shot-to-shot variation of atomnumber normally present in ultracold-atom experiments. We find that quantumfluctuations alone produce some, but not all, of the features of thecorrelation function, whereas atom-number fluctuation alone can produce all theobserved features, and agreement is best when both are included.

Regular spherical solutions of this class satisfying the weak energy condition have obligatory de Sitter center. Rotation transforms de Sitter center into the equatorial de Sitter vacuum disk. Regular solutions have the Kerr or Kerr-Newman asymptotics for a distant observer, at most two horizons and two ergospheres, and two different kinds of interiors. For regular rotating solutions originated from spherical solutions satisfying the dominant energy condition, there can exist the interior -surface of de Sitter vacuum which contains the de Sitter disk as a bridge. In the case when a related spherical solution violates the dominant energy condition, vacuum interior of a rotating object reduces to the de Sitter disk only.",1
62387,2,"Vortex-like solutions and internal structures of covariant ideal magnetohydrodynamics We discuss a manifestly covariant formulation of ideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, which has been recently used in astrophysical and heavy-ion contexts, and compare it to other similar frameworks.

Such solutions are further used to demonstrate that inhomogeneous Maxwell equations, implicitly included in the covariant framework, may generate very large electric charge densities. This suggests that solutions of the covariant formulation may violate in some cases the assumptions of standard ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Furthermore, we show that the flow four-vector and conserved currents obtained in the covariant approach are usually not related to each other, which hinders kinetic-theory interpretation of the obtained results.",1

We construct realistic simulated stacked weak lensing and X-ray surface brightness cluster profiles from these cosmological simulations, and then use these data projected along various lines of sight to test the spherical symmetry of our stacking procedure. We also test the applicability of the NFW profile to model weak lensing profiles of clusters in f(R) gravity. Finally, we test the validity of the analytical model developed in W15 against the simulated profiles. Overall, we find our methodology is robust and broadly agrees with these simulated data. We also apply our full Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis from W15 to our simulated X-ray and lensing profiles, providing consistent constraints on the modified gravity parameters as obtained from the real cluster data, e.g. for our ΛCDM simulation we obtain |f_R0| < 8.3 × 10^−5 (95 per cent CL), which is in good agreement with the W15 measurement of |f_R0| < 6 × 10^−5.

62522,2,"Cage-Net Fracton Models We introduce a novel class of gapped three-dimensional models, dubbed ""cage-net fracton models,"" which host immobile fracton excitations in addition to non-Abelian particles with restricted mobility. Starting from layers of two-dimensional string-net models, whose spectrum includes non-Abelian anyons, we condense extended one-dimensional ""flux-strings"" built out of point-like excitations. Flux-string condensation generalizes the concept of anyon condensation familiar from conventional topological order and allows us to establish properties of the fracton ordered (equivalently, flux-string condensed) phase, such as its ground state wave function and spectrum of excitations. Through the examples of doubled Ising and SU(2)$_k$ cage-net models, we explicitly demonstrate the existence of non-Abelian particles restricted to move only along one- or two-dimensions in the fracton phase, along with that of strictly immobile Abelian fractons. We further show that the ground state wave function of such phases can be understood as a fluctuating network of extended objects - cages - and strings, which we dub a cage-net condensate. Besides having implications for topological quantum computation in three dimensions, our work may also point the way towards more general insights into quantum phases of matter with fracton order.",1
62556,2,"Divergence equations and uniqueness theorem of static black holes Equations of divergence type in static spacetimes play a significant role in the proof of uniqueness theorems of black holes. We generalize the divergence equation originally discovered by Robinson in four dimensional vacuum spacetimes into several directions. We find that the deviation from spherical symmetry is encoded in a symmetric trace-free tensor $H_{ij}$ on a static timeslice. This tensor is the crux of the construction of the desired divergence equation, which allows us to conclude the uniqueness of the Schwarzschild black hole without using Smarr's integration mass formula. In Einstein-Maxwell(-dilaton) theory, we apply the maximal principle for a number of divergence equations to prove the uniqueness theorem of static black holes. In higher $(n\ge 5)$ dimensional vacuum spacetimes, a central obstruction for applicability of the current proof is the integration of the $(n-2)$-dimensional scalar curvature over the horizon cross-section, which has been evaluated to be a topological constant by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for $n=4$. Nevertheless, it turns out that the $(n-1)$-dimensional symmetric and traceless tensor $H_{ij}$ is still instrumental for the modification of the uniqueness proof based upon the positive mass theorem, as well as for the derivation of the Penrose-type inequality.",1

It is confirmed that the neutron anomalous magnetic moment increases by increasing the density, while it decreases as the magnetic field grows. The energy and equation of state for the system have also been investigated.",1

62679,2,"Analytics and Numerics of Spontaneous Emission of Light at the Optical Event Horizon Interest in the study of the scattering of light at a moving refractive index front (RIF) in a dispersive dielectric has recently surged due to the hope of understanding the conditions under which Hawking Radiation may be observed in such systems. Indeed, the kinematics of waves at the RIF are analogous to that on curved space-time geometries. At the horizon, waves of positive and negative norm scatter into each other, which results in the mixing of the creation and annihilation operators of the field and thus in spontaneous emission from the vacuum. In optics, pairwise emission at the horizon occurs in correlated photons of positive and negative frequency. We here present an analytical method that relies on the study of plane wave solutions to a dispersion relation that realistically reproduces the material properties of fused silica or optical fibres, for example, in a time-varying curved one-dimensional background. The method directly and efficiently yields a spectrum, unlike traditional numerical techniques, and can be generalised to considerations of rapidly, smoothly varying background, unlike other analytical methods. We demonstrate that our method enables for readily computing the two essential observables of spontaneous emission at a moving RIF: phase-space and real-space spectra. We compute spectra of light spontaneously emitted at the RIF in the frame co-moving with the RIF as well as in the laboratory frame. We calculate and compute the cross-correlations between mode-solutions in the moving frame and across the spectrum of emission in the laboratory frame. The analytical calculation herein can be used as is to predict observables for an optical experiment. The numerical results of this study are the first complete set of phase- and real-space observables calculated for realistic experimental conditions.",1

The momentum of scattered photon distributes outside of the reaction plane determined by the incident photon and the scattered electron, and hence the energy of the scattered photon also distributes. This novel result indicates that one can identify a gamma-ray vortex by measuring coincidentally the scattered angles of the electron and photon.",1

Inside the critical regime gapless fermionic and bosonic excitations are strongly coupled, leading to a \emph{universal} suppression of the inter-band OC according to $\sigma^{\rm IB}_0 [1-N_b/(2N_f)]$ for $N_f \gg 1$ as $T \to 0$ to the leading order in $\epsilon$-expansion, where $N_f (N_b)$ is the fermionic(bosonic) flavor number, $\sigma^{\rm IB}_0$ is the OC of a non-interacting Dirac fluid, and $\epsilon=3-d$. Furthermore, the weight of the Drude peak inside the critical regime also gets suppressed following a universal scaling function, while maintaining its delta function profile. Correction to the OC at such a non-Gaussian critical point due to the long-range Coulomb interaction and generalization of these scenarios to a strongly interacting three-dimensional Dirac or Weyl liquid are also presented.",1

Based on the fundamental principles of the quantum theory we give the proof that there is no time interval in which the survival probability (decay law) could be a decreasing function of time of the purely exponential form but even at the “exponential” regime the decay curve is oscillatory modulated with a smaller or a large amplitude of oscillations depending on parameters of the model considered.",1

For this we develop the method of the mirror diagrams based on the dual schemes of the Darboux-Crum transformations to generate rational deformations of the isotonic oscillator systems from the quantum harmonic oscillator. We show that unlike the rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator systems case, one can obtain infinite families of completely isospectral rational extensions of the isotonic oscillator in addition to non-isospectral gapped deformations. For each completely isospectral or gapped deformation of the isotonic oscillator system given by a mirror diagram, we identify the sets of spectrum-generating ladder operators which coherently reflect its peculiarities such as the number of the valence bands, the total number of the energy levels in them, and the spacing between energy levels of the ground state and the lowest state in the infinite equidistant part of the spectrum.",1

Their entangled groundstates are known exactly but not their excitation spectra. We first express the groundstates in the continuum which allows for the calculation of spin and entanglement properties in a unified fashion. Doing so, we uncover an emergent conformal-type symmetry, thus consolidating the connection to a widely studied family of Lifshitz quantum critical points in 2d. We then obtain the low lying excited states via large-scale DMRG simulations and find that the dynamical exponent is $z=3.2$ in both cases. Other excited states show a different z, indicating that these models have multiple dynamics. Moreover, we modify the spin-1/2 model by adding a ferromagnetic Heisenberg term, which changes the entire spectrum. We track the resulting non-trivial evolution of the dynamical exponents using DMRG. Finally, we exploit an exact map from the quantum Hamiltonian to the non-equilibrium dynamics of a classical spin chain to shed light on the quantum dynamics.",1

Such type of paths has been found to describe the problem of variable mass in the presence of Riemannian geometry. This may give rise to detect the effect of dark matter which reveals the mystery of motion of celestial objects that are not responding neither to Newtonian nor Einsteinian gravity. An important link between non-geodesic equations and the dipolar particle or fluids has been introduced to apply the concept of geometization of physics. This concept has been already extended to represent the hydrodynamic equations in a geometric way. Such an approach, demands to seek for an appropriate theory of gravity able to describe different regions, eligible for detecting dark matter. Using different versions of bi-metric theory of gravity, to examine their associate non-geodesic paths.

62882,2,"Does space-time torsion determine the minimum mass of gravitating particles? We derive upper and lower limits for the mass–radius ratio of spin-fluid spheres in Einstein–Cartan theory, with matter satisfying a linear barotropic equation of state, and in the presence of a cosmological constant. Adopting a spherically symmetric interior geometry, we obtain the generalized continuity and Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations for a Weyssenhoff spin fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium, expressed in terms of the effective mass, density and pressure, all of which contain additional contributions from the spin. The generalized Buchdahl inequality, which remains valid at any point in the interior, is obtained, and general theoretical limits for the maximum and minimum mass–radius ratios are derived. As an application of our results we obtain gravitational red shift bounds for compact spin-fluid objects, which may (in principle) be used for observational tests of Einstein–Cartan theory in an astrophysical context. We also briefly consider applications of the torsion-induced minimum mass to the spin-generalized strong gravity model for baryons/mesons, and show that the existence of quantum spin imposes a lower bound for spinning particles, which almost exactly reproduces the electron mass.",1

However, extracting the same result from the Lorent-Abraham-Dirac (LAD) equation of motion is problematic. This is well known for uniform proper acceleration for which case the radiation force vanishes and hence the very origin of the radiated energy is not clear, leading to an energy balance paradox. The purpose of this letter is first to evince that this problem occurs in the general case and not only for uniform acceleration. Second we show that the widely accepted treatment based on the bound field technique cannot fix the energy balance discrepancy. Indeed the related Schott term is not a legitimate four-momentum for being indefinite and not conserved.",1

The production cross section of HΛ6(1exc.+) is evaluated by a coupled (H5-Λ)+(He5-Σ−) model with a spreading potential, in comparison with the data of the missing mass spectrum at the J-PARC E10 experiment. The result indicates that the Σ− mixing probabilities in HΛ6(1exc.+) are PΣ−<∼0.2% both for sΣ state and for pΣ state in order to reproduce no significant peak in the Λ production data, so that the cross section of HΛ6 is less than on the order of 0.4 nb/sr. The sensitivity of the ΣΛ coupling and Λ potentials to the near-Λ-threshold spectrum is discussed. The shape and magnitude of the spectrum provide valuable information on the ΣΛ coupling in the production mechanism and also the nuclear structure of HΛ6(1exc.+).",1

Like the Kerr spacetime, the draining bathtub geometry possesses an (effective) horizon, an ergosphere and null circular orbits. We propose here that a ‘pulse’ disturbance may be used to map out the light-cone of the effective geometry. First, we apply the eikonal approximation to elucidate the link between wavefronts, null geodesic congruences and the Raychaudhuri equation. Next, we solve the wave equation numerically in the time domain using the method of lines. Starting with Gaussian initial data, we demonstrate that a pulse will propagate along a null congruence and thus trace out the light-cone of the effective geometry. Our new results reveal features, such as wavefront intersections, frame-dragging, winding and interference effects, that are closely associated with the presence of null circular orbits and the ergosphere.",1

Rotation transforms a de Sitter center into a de Sitter vacuum disk which is the generic common constituent of all regular rotating objects. In nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to gravity all metrics belong to the Kerr-Schild class and have the Kerr-Newman asymptotic for a distant observer.

We outline the basic generic features of regular rotating black holes and solitons which are regular compact objects without event horizons, replacing naked singularities.",1
63070,2,"Quantum vacuum fluctuations in presence of dissipative bodies: Dynamical approach for nonequilibrium and squeezed states The present work contributes to the study of nonequilibrium aspects of the Casimir forces with the introduction of squeezed states in the calculations. Throughout this article two main results can be found, being both strongly correlated. Primarily, the more formal result involves the development of a first-principles canonical quantization formalism to study the quantum vacuum in the presence of different dissipative material bodies in completely general scenarios. For this purpose, we consider a one-dimensional quantum scalar field interacting with the volume elements’ degrees of freedom of the material bodies, which are modeled as a set of composite systems consisting of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with an environment (provided as an infinite set of quantum harmonic oscillators acting as a thermal bath). Solving the full dynamics of the composite system through its Heisenberg equations, we study each contribution to the field operator by employing general properties of the Green function. We deduce the long-time limit of the contributions to the field operator. In agreement with previous works, we show that the expectation values of the components of the energy-momentum tensor present two contributions, one associated to the thermal baths and the other one associated to the field’s initial conditions. This allows the direct study of steady situations involving different initial states for the field (keeping arbitrary thermal states for the baths). This leads to the other main result, consisting of computing the Casimir force when the field is initially in thermal or continuum-single-mode squeezed states (the latter being characterized by a given bandwidth and frequency). Time averaging is required for the squeezed case, showing that both results can be given in a unified way, while for the thermal state, all the well-known equilibrium results can be successfully reproduced. Finally, we compared the initial conditions’ contribution and the total force for each case, showing that the latter can be tuned in a wide range of values through varying the size of the bandwidth.",1

The vanishing of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor for the comoving congruence of observers, suggests that no gravitational radiation is produced during the evolution of the system. Instead, the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor as measured by tilted observers is nonvanishing (as well as the shear, the four–acceleration, the vorticity and the dissipation), giving rise to a flux of gravitational radiation that can be characterized through the super–Poynting vector. This result strengthens further the relevance of the role of observers in the description of a physical system.

These models deviate from standard general relativity (GR) more strongly in low-density regions and thus voids are a promising venue to test them. We use halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescriptions to populate haloes with galaxies, and tune the HOD parameters such that the galaxy two-point correlation functions are the same in both f(R) and GR models. We identify both three-dimensional (3D) voids and two-dimensional (2D) underdensities in the plane of the sky to find the same void abundance and void galaxy number density profiles across all models, which suggests that they do not contain much information beyond galaxy clustering. However, the underlying void dark matter density profiles are significantly different, with f(R) voids being more underdense than GR ones, which leads to f(R) voids having a larger tangential shear signal than their GR analogues. We investigate the potential of each void finder to test f(R) models with near-future lensing surveys such as euclid and lsst. The 2D voids have the largest power to probe f(R) gravity, with an lsst analysis of tunnel (which is a new type of 2D underdensity introduced here) lensing distinguishing at 80 and 11σ (statistical error) f(R) models with parameters, |fR0| = 10^−5 and 10^−6, from GR.",1

A previous analysis based on redshift-space distortions (RSD) data concluded that the model was ruled out. In this work we revisit the issue and find that, when recast in a localized model, the DW model is not ruled out and actually gives a better fit to RSD data than ΛCDM. In fact, the DW model presents a suppressed growth of matter perturbations with respect to ΛCDM and a slightly lower value of σ(8), as favored by observations. We also produce analytical approximations of the two modified gravity functions, i.e. the anisotropic stress η and the relative change of Newton's constant Y, and of fσ(8)(z) as a function of redshift. Finally, we also show how much the fit depends on initial conditions when these are generalized with respect to a standard matter-dominated era.",1

63970,2,On Gauge Invariance and Covariant Derivatives in Metric Spaces In this note we will discuss the consistencies of the assumptions used to construct covariant derivatives in a metric space. We will use the Maxwell's equations in a curved spacetime to discuss this issue. We will show that the gauge invariance of the Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic potentials in a general metric spacetime give a new expression of the Ricci tensor. We will discuss possible disagreement of this new expression of the Ricci tensor with the conventional expression in a particular spacetime. The spacetime need not to satisfy the Einstein's equations. A disagreement indicates that the Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic potentials in a general metric spacetime are not invariant under the most general gauge transformations. The electromagnetic field tensor and consequently the Maxwell's equations for the fields remain gauge invariant. This is a contradiction. We will briefly discuss the significance of the results to differential geometry of curved spaces. This article may become important to gravitational physics. This article may also be significant to differential geometry of general affine spaces.,1
64032,2,"Investigating the X-ray counterparts to unidentified sources in the 1000-orbit INTEGRAL/IBIS catalogue The latest INTEGRAL/IBIS all-sky survey lists 219 hard X-ray sources whose nature is still unknown. We report on our ongoing campaign aimed at identifying these high-energy emitters by exploiting the focusing capabilities of the X-ray Telescope (XRT, 0.2–10 keV) onboard Swift, which allow an enhancement of the source localization to arcsec level, thus facilitating the identification of the likely counterpart. By cross-correlating the list of the unidentified IBIS sources included in the latest IBIS catalogue with Swift/XRT archival data, we found a set of 14 objects, not yet reported in the literature, for which XRT data were available. We found no detection in only one case, a single X-ray association in nine sources and 2/3 associations in the remaining objects. We then made use of multiwaveband archives to search for counterparts at other wavelengths of these XRT detections and exploited X-ray spectral information in an attempt to determine their nature and association with the IBIS object. As a result of our analysis, we identified a single counterpart for 13 sources, although in some cases its nature/class could not be assessed on the basis of the information collected. More specifically, we found that SWIFT J0924.2−3141 and SWIFT J1839.1−5717 are absorbed AGN, while SWIFT J0800.7−4309 and 1SWXRT J230642.8+550817 are cataclysmic variable binary systems.

The SVD was applied on a response matrix from magneto-motive forces to the magnetic fields in the muon storage region and two-dimensional (2D) placements of magneto-motive forces were designed by tuning the magnetic field eigenmode strengths obtained by the magnetic field. The tuning was performed iteratively. Magnetic field ripples in the azimuthal direction were minimized for the design.,1

The impact of this energy loss on particle motion, called radiation reaction, becomes significant in intense-laser matter interactions, where it can reduce collision energies, hinder particle acceleration schemes, and is seemingly unavoidable. Here we show that this common belief breaks down in short laser pulses, and that energy losses and radiation reaction can be controlled and effectively switched off by appropriate tuning of the pulse length. This “quenching” of emission is impossible in classical physics, but becomes possible in QED due to the discrete nature of quantum emissions.",1
64168,2,"Improving Predictions with Reliable Extrapolation Schemes and Better Understanding of Factorization We investigate two distinct sources of uncertainty in low-energy nuclear physics calculations and develop ways to account for them. Harmonic oscillator basis expansions are widely used in ab-initio nuclear structure calculations. Finite computational resources usually require that the basis be truncated before observables are fully converged, necessitating reliable extrapolation schemes. We show that a finite oscillator basis effectively imposes a hard-wall boundary condition. We accurately determine the position of the hard-wall as a function of oscillator space parameters, derive extrapolation formulas for the energy and other observables, and discuss the extension of this approach to higher angular momentum. Nucleon knockout reactions have been widely used to study and understand nuclear properties. Such an analysis implicitly assumes that the effects of the probe can be separated from the physics of the target nucleus. This factorization between nuclear structure and reaction components depends on the renormalization scale and scheme, and has not been well understood. But it is potentially critical for interpreting experiments and for extracting process-independent nuclear properties. We use similarity renormalization group (SRG) transformations to systematically study the scale dependence of factorization for the simplest knockout process of deuteron electrodisintegration. We find that the extent of scale dependence depends strongly on kinematics, but in a systematic way. Based on examination of the relevant overlap matrix elements, we are able to qualitatively explain and even predict the nature of scale dependence based on the kinematics under consideration.",1
64209,2,"Narrow-band GeV photons generated from an x-ray free-electron laser oscillator We propose a scheme to generate narrow-band GeV photons, γ-rays, via Compton scattering of hard x-ray photons in an x-ray free-electron laser oscillator. Generated γ-rays show a narrow-band spectrum with a sharp peak, ∼0.1% (FWHM), due to large momentum transfer from electrons to photons. The γ-ray beam has a spectral density of ∼102  ph/(MeV s) with a typical set of parameters based on a 7-GeV electron beam operated at 3-MHz repetition, Such γ-rays will be a unique probe for studying hadron physics. Features of the γ-ray source, flux, spectrum, polarization, tunability and energy resolution are discussed.",1
64252,2,"Energy levels of one-dimensional systems satisfying the minimal length uncertainty relation The standard approach to calculating the energy levels for quantum systems satisfying the minimal length uncertainty relation is to solve an eigenvalue problem involving a fourth- or higher-order differential equation in quasiposition space. It is shown that the problem can be reformulated so that the energy levels of these systems can be obtained by solving only a second-order quasiposition eigenvalue equation. Through this formulation the energy levels are calculated for the following potentials: particle in a box, harmonic oscillator, Pöschl–Teller well, Gaussian well, and double-Gaussian well. For the particle in a box, the second-order quasiposition eigenvalue equation is a second-order differential equation with constant coefficients. For the harmonic oscillator, Pöschl–Teller well, Gaussian well, and double-Gaussian well, a method that involves using Wronskians has been used to solve the second-order quasiposition eigenvalue equation. It is observed for all of these quantum systems that the introduction of a nonzero minimal length uncertainty induces a positive shift in the energy levels. It is shown that the calculation of energy levels in systems satisfying the minimal length uncertainty relation is not limited to a small number of problems like particle in a box and the harmonic oscillator but can be extended to a wider class of problems involving potentials such as the Pöschl–Teller and Gaussian wells.",1

64335,2,"Test of non-Newtonian gravitational forces at micrometer range with two-dimensional force mapping We report an isoelectronic test of non-Newtonian forces at micrometer range by sensing the lateral force between a gold sphere and a density modulation source mass using a soft cantilever. Two-dimensional (2D) force mapping, in combination with in situ topographic imaging, is applied to verify the isoelectronic property of the surface. The force signal is found to be electrostatic force dominated, which is correlated with the density modulation structure for thinner gold coating and reduced by thicker gold coating and thermal annealing. Maximum likelihood estimation is used to extract the constraint on the hypothetical force based on the 2D data, and the experiment sets a constraint on the Yukawa type forces without subtraction of the model dependent force background. This result would be a meaningful complementary to previous tests with different methods.",1

The calculated luminosities are compared with observed ones in terms of timeaveraged mass accretion rate. It is shown that neutrino emission by strong pion condensation can explain quiescent X-ray luminosity of SAX J1808.4-3658 and we do not need direct Urca processes concerning nucleons and/or hyperons.,1
64404,2,"Amplification of gravitational motion via Quantum weak measurement We investigate a new experimental possibility of measuring the Newtonian gravitational constant $G$ by using the weak measurement. Amplification via weak measurement is one of the interesting phenomena of quantum mechanics. In this letter, we consider it in a system consisting of many cold atoms which are gravitationally interacting with an external macroscopic source and show that it is possible to obtain ${\mathcal{O}}(10^{3})$ amplification of their relative motion compared with the classical motion when the number of atoms are ${\mathcal{O}}(10^{15})$ and the observing time is $\sim 0.5$s. This result suggests that it might be possible to use this system as a new experimental set up for determining $G$. Besides, our study indicates that the gravitational force can behave as a repulsive force because of the weak measurement.",1

For the charge is constrained on the spherical surface with monopole at the origin, the commutation relations between all components of geometric momentum and the orbital angular momentum satisfy the $so(3,1)$ algebra. With construction of the geometrically infinitesimal displacement operator based on the geometric momentum, the $so(3,1)$ algebra implies the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift.

64501,2,"A 2.4% Determination of the Local Value of the Hubble Constant We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant from 3.3% to 2.4%. The bulk of this improvement comes from new near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), more than doubling the sample of reliable SNe Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a total of 19, these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation based on ∼300 SNe Ia at z < 0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical and NIR, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC 4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST/FGS, HST/WFC3 spatial scanning and/or Hipparcos, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant from each is 72.25 ± 2.51, 72.04 ± 2.67, 76.18 ± 2.37, and 74.50 ± 3.27 km s(−)(1) Mpc(−)(1), respectively. Our best estimate of H (0) = 73.24 ± 1.74 km s(−)(1) Mpc(−)(1) combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC, yielding a 2.4% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is 3.4σ higher than 66.93 ± 0.62 km s(−)(1) Mpc(−)(1) predicted by ΛCDM with 3 neutrino flavors having a mass of 0.06 eV and the new Planck data, but the discrepancy reduces to 2.1σ relative to the prediction of 69.3 ± 0.7 km s(−)(1) Mpc(−)(1) based on the comparably precise combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift measurements and our local determination of H (0) at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early universe in the range of ΔN (eff) ≈ 0.4–1. We anticipate further significant improvements in H (0) from upcoming parallax measurements of long-period MW Cepheids.",1

Inhomogeneities in the ionised fraction, but also in the baryon density, in the velocity fields and in the gravitational potentials are expected to generate correlated CMB perturbations. We present a complete relativistic treatment of all these effects, up to second order in perturbation theory, that we solve using the numerical Boltzmann code {\SONG}. The physical origin and relevance of all second order terms are carefully discussed. In addition to collisional and gravitational contributions, we identify the diffuse analogue of the blurring and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects. Our approach naturally includes the correlations between the imprint from patchy reionisation and the diffuse SZ effects thereby allowing us to derive reliable estimates of the induced temperature and polarisation CMB angular power spectra. In particular, we show that the B-modes generated at intermediate length-scales (ℓ simeq 100) have the same amplitude as the B-modes coming from primordial gravitational waves with a tensor-to-scalar ratio r=10(−)(4).",1

64670,2,"Chiral tricritical point: a new universality class in Dirac systems Tricriticality, as a sister of criticality, is a fundamental and absorbing issue in condensed matter physics. It has been verified that the bosonic Wilson-Fisher universality class can be changed by gapless fermionic modes at criticality. However, the counterpart phenomena at tricriticality have rarely been explored. In this paper, we study a model in which a tricritical Ising model is coupled to massless Dirac fermions. We find that the massless Dirac fermions result in the emergence of a new tricritical point, which we refer to as the chiral tricritical point (CTP), at the phase boundary between the Dirac semimetal and the charge-density-wave insulator. From functional renormalization group analysis of the effective action, we obtain the critical behaviors of the CTP, which are qualitatively distinct from both the tricritical Ising universality and the chiral Ising universality. We further extend the calculations of the chiral tricritical behaviors of Ising spins to the case of Heisenberg spins. The experimental relevance of the CTP in two-dimensional Dirac semimetals is also discussed.",1
64724,2,"Electron–positron pair production from vacuum in the field of high-intensity laser radiation The works dealing with the theory of e$^{+}$ e$^{–}$ pair production from vacuum under the action of highintensity laser radiation are reviewed. The following problems are discussed: pair production in a constant electric field E and time-variable homogeneous field E(t), the dependence of the number of produced pairs ${N_{{e^ + }{e^ - }}}$ on the shape of a laser pulse (dynamic Schwinger effect), and a realistic three-dimensional model of a focused laser pulse, which is based on exact solution of Maxwell’s equations and contains parameters such as focal spot radius R, diffraction length L, focusing parameter Δ, pulse duration τ, and pulse shape. This model is used to calculate ${N_{{e^ + }{e^ - }}}$ for both a single laser pulse (n = 1) and several (n ≥ 2) coherent pulses with a fixed total energy that simultaneously “collide” in a laser focus. It is shown that, at n ≫ 1, the number of pairs increases by several orders of magnitude as compared to the case of a single pulse. The screening of a laser field by the vapors that are generated in vacuum, its “depletion,” and the limiting fields to be achieved in laser experiments are considered. The relation between pair production, the problem of a quantum frequency-variable oscillator, and the theory of groups SU(1, 1) and SU(2) is discussed. The relativistic version of the imaginary time method is used in calculations. In terms of this version, a relativistic theory of tunneling is developed and the Keldysh theory is generalized to the case of ionization of relativistic bound systems, namely, atoms and ions. The ionization rate of a hydrogen-like ion with a charge 1 ≤ Z ≤ 92 is calculated as a function of laser radiation intensity (F and ellipticity ρ.",1
64729,2,"A Waveguide Overloaded Cavity Kicker for the MAX IV Bunch-by-Bunch Feedback System The higher-order modes (HOMs) in the main and the 3:rd harmonic cavities are driving longitudinal coupled-bunch mode instabilities (CBMIs) in the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring. This far, negative feedback has been applied in the longitudinal plane by a stripline kicker at lower ring currents. However, the maximum longitudinal feedback voltage provided by the stripline is rather weak, and a waveguide overload cavity was therefore designed in order to suppress CBMIs at higher ring currents as well. Due to the long bunch length in the MAX IV storage rings, a relatively low center frequency of 625 MHz is selected. The new cavity kicker has been manufactured, and will be installed in the 3 GeV ring during the summer shut-down of 2017. In this paper, the RF and mechanical design of the cavity is presented. Simulation results are also compared with measurements of the manufactured cavity.",1

Using the fix point method and taking linear homogeneous perturbations, we find that the scale factor of Einstein static universe for closed deformed isotropic and homogeneous FLRW universe depends on the coupling parameter $\lambda$ between the energy-momentum tensor and the gradient of Ricci scalar. Thus, in the present model and in presence of vacuum energy, our universe can stay at the Einstein static state past-eternally, which means that the big bang singularity may be resolved successfully in the context of Einstein static universe in Rastall theory.",1

64918,2,"Monte Carlo population synthesis on massive star binaries: Astrophysical implications for gravitational wave sources There are important but unresolved processes in the standard formation scenarios of double compact star binaries (DCBs; BH-BH, BH-NS, NS-NS systems), such as the mass transfer and common envelope (CE). We analyze the effects of different assumptions on key physical processes of the massive star binary evolution toward DCBs, which have not been tested in previous studies. We find that different prescriptions for the mass transfer and the binding energy parameter in the CE phase have moderate influence on the merger rates and properties of BH-BH systems, but significantly affect those of DCBs containing a NS. The small initial separation enhances the merger rate of BH-BH systems. The small initial separation enhances the BH-BH merger rate. We confirm that a low metallicity (Population II) is a key for the GW150914-like BH-BH binaries, and we find the predicted rate can be compatible to the inferred rate if an optimized model is adopted. The GW151226-like systems are naturally expected at the solar metallicity (Population I) within the standard CE evolution. If these two systems are to be explained this way through the CE evolution as results of Pop II and Pop I systems, respectively, then the transition in the mode of the evolution must occur at $Z \sim 0.002 - 0.005$ $(0.13-0.25Z_{\odot})$ to compare to the observed relative frequency of these two types of events. On the other hand, the indirectly indicated NS-NS merger rate from observed NS-NS systems (Kim et al. 2015) can be reproduced by the BPS simulations only by the conditions inconsistent with those to explain the BH-BH merger rate through the isolated binary evolution scenario. Therefore, we predict that the NS-NS merger rate is indeed higher than so far inferred by the indirect method, or otherwise the BH-BH GW systems should be formed through a different evolutionarily pathway than NS-NS systems.",1
64929,2,"A full general relativistic neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of a collapsing very massive star and the formation of a black hole We study the final fate of a very massive star by performing full general relativistic (GR), three-dimensional (3D) simulation with three-flavor multi-energy neutrino transport. Utilizing a 70 solar mass zero metallicity progenitor, we self-consistently follow the radiation-hydrodynamics from the onset of gravitational core-collapse until the second collapse of the proto-neutron star (PNS), leading to black hole (BH) formation. Our results show that the BH formation occurs at a post-bounce time of ~300 ms for the 70 Msun star. This is significantly earlier than those in the literature where lower mass progenitors were employed. At a few ~10 ms before BH formation, we find that the stalled bounce shock is revived by intense neutrino heating from the very hot PNS, which is aided by violent convection behind the shock. In the context of 3D-GR core-collapse modeling with multi-energy neutrino transport, our numerical results present the first evidence to validate a fallback BH formation scenario of the 70 Msun star.",1
64986,2,"Temperature effects on nuclear pseudospin symmetry in the Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov formalism We present finite-temperature Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov (FTDHB) calculations for the tin isotope chain to study the dependence of pseudospin on the nuclear temperature. In the FTDHB calculation, the density dependence of the self-consistent relativistic mean fields, the pairing, and the vapor phase that takes into account the unbound nucleon states are considered self-consistently. The mean-field potentials obtained in the FTDHB calculations are fit by Woods-Saxon (WS) potentials to examine how the WS parameters are related to the energy splitting of the pseudospin pairs as the temperature increases. We find that the nuclear potential surface diffuseness is the main driver for the pseudospin splittings and that it increases as the temperature grows. We conclude that pseudospin symmetry is better realized when the nuclear temperature increases. The results confirm the findings of previous works using relativistic mean field theory at T=0, namely that the correlation between the pseudospin splitting and the parameters of the Woods-Saxon potentials implies that pseudospin symmetry is a dynamical symmetry in nuclei. We show that the dynamical nature of the pseudospin symmetry remains when the temperature is considered in a realistic calculation of the tin isotopes, such as that of the Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov formalism.",1
65035,2,"On Effective Holographic Mott Insulators We present a class of holographic models that behave effectively as prototypes of Mott insulators — materials where electron-electron interactions dominate transport phenomena. The main ingredient in the gravity dual is that the gauge-field dynamics contains self-interactions by way of a particular type of non-linear electrodynamics. The electrical response in these models exhibits typical features of Mott-like states: i) the low-temperature DC conductivity is unboundedly low, ii) metal-insulator transitions appear by varying various parameters, iii) for large enough self-interaction strength, the conductivity can even decrease with increasing doping (density of carriers) — which appears as a sharp manifestation of ‘traffic-jam’-like behaviour, iv) the insulating state becomes very unstable towards superconductivity at large enough doping. We exhibit some of the properties of the resulting insulator-superconductor transition, which is sensitive to the momentum dissipation rate in a specific way. These models imply a clear and generic correlation between Mott behaviour and significant effects in the nonlinear electrical response. We compute the nonlinear current-voltage curve in our model and find that indeed at large voltage the conductivity is largely reduced.",1

The amplitudes of the leading oscillating terms in the dimer correlation functions are determined with high accuracy as functions of the exchange anisotropy parameter and the external magnetic field through the combined use of bosonization and density-matrix renormalization-group methods. In particular, for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with SU(2) symmetry, logarithmic corrections to the dimer correlations due to the marginally irrelevant operator are studied, and the asymptotic form of the dimer correlation function is obtained. The asymptotic form of the spin-Peierls excitation gap including logarithmic corrections is also derived.",1

Slip stacking is an accumulation technique used at Fermilab to nearly double proton intensity by maintaining two beams of different momenta in the same storage ring. The two particle beams are longitudinally focused in the Recycler by two 53 MHz 100 kV rf cavities with a small frequency difference between them. We propose an additional 106 MHz 20 kV rf cavity with a frequency at the double the average of the upper and lower main rf frequencies. We show the harmonic rf cavity cancels out the resonances generated between the two main rf cavities and we derive the relationship between the harmonic rf voltage and the main rf voltage. We find the area factors that can be used to calculate the available phase space area for any set of beam parameters without individual simulation. We establish Booster beam quality requirements to achieve 99% slip stacking efficiency. We measure the longitudinal distribution of the Booster beam and use it to generate a realistic beam model for slip stacking simulation. We demonstrate that the harmonic rf cavity can not only reduce particle loss during slip stacking, but also reduce the final longitudinal emittance.",1
65180,2,"De Donder–Weyl Hamiltonian formalism of MacDowell–Mansouri gravity We analyse the behaviour of the MacDowell–Mansouri action with internal symmetry group ${\rm SO}(4, 1)$ under the De Donder–Weyl Hamiltonian formulation.

The decomposition of the internal algebra $\mathfrak{so}(4, 1)\simeq\mathfrak{so}(3, 1)\oplus\mathbb{R}^{3, 1}$ allows the symmetry breaking ${\rm SO}(4, 1)\to{\rm SO}(3, 1)$ , which reduces the original action to the Palatini action without the topological term.

65313,2,"Are we close to putting the anomalous perihelion precessions from Verlinde’s emergent gravity to the test? In the framework of the emergent gravity scenario by Verlinde, it was recently observed by Liu and Prokopec that, among other things, an anomalous pericenter precession would affect the orbital motion of a test particle orbiting an isolated central body. Here, it is shown that, if it were real, its expected magnitude for the inner planets of the Solar System would be at the same level of the present-day accuracy in constraining any possible deviations from their standard perihelion precessions as inferred from long data records spanning about the last century. The most favorable situation for testing the Verlinde-type precession seems to occur for Mars. Indeed, according to recent versions of the EPM and INPOP planetary ephemerides, non-standard perihelion precessions, of whatsoever physical origin, which are larger than some $\approx $ 0.02–0.11 milliarcseconds per century are not admissible, while the putative precession predicted by Liu and Prokopec amounts to 0.09 milliarcseconds per century. Other potentially interesting astronomical and astrophysical scenarios like, e.g., the Earth’s LAGEOS II artificial satellite, the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B and the S-stars orbiting the Supermassive Black Hole in Sgr A$^*$ are, instead, not viable because of the excessive smallness of the predicted precessions for them.",1

65466,2,"APPLICATION OF METHODS FROM NUMERICAL RELATIVITY TO LATE-UNIVERSE COSMOLOGY One of the biggest challenges to our current understanding of fundamental physics is the unknown matter-energy content of the universe. Thought to be dominated by dark energy and dark matter, a variety of models have arisen attempting to describe these components, with possible explanations ranging from modifications to the the- ory of general relativity to hypothetical fields driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. As new theories are developed to describe the underlying physics of dark energy and dark matter, increasing levels of precision and accuracy are required from both theoretical predictions and observational data in order to differentiate between various models.
Numerical simulations enable predictions with sub-percent-level accuracy to be extracted from these theories and compared to observations. However, developing sufficiently realistic numerical models requires the consideration of a wide range of physical effects, including gravitational interactions and stress-energy sources. This thesis presents new tools for modeling gravitational effects using the full theory of general relativity, with the goal of enabling the determination of a correct model of fundamental dark sector physics.
In this work, a novel formulation of general relativity is developed and applied in a cosmological setting. A code developed to numerically evolve this formulation is presented in detail. A demonstration of the code’s ability to accurately model cosmological dynamics is included as a proof of concept, illustrating the potential of this approach to predict observable consequences of gravitational interactions with unprecedented accuracy.",1
65589,2,"Modelling Void Abundance in Modified Gravity We use a spherical model and an extended excursion set formalism with drifting diffusive barriers to predict the abundance of cosmic voids in the context of general relativity as well as f(R) and symmetron models of modified gravity. We detect spherical voids from a suite of N-body simulations of these gravity theories and compare the measured void abundance to theory predictions. We find that our model correctly describes the abundance of both dark matter and galaxy voids, providing a better fit than previous proposals in the literature based on static barriers. We use the simulation abundance results to fit for the abundance model free parameters as a function of modified gravity parameters, and show that counts of dark matter voids can provide interesting constraints on modified gravity. For galaxy voids, more closely related to optical observations, we find that constraining modified gravity from void abundance alone may be significantly more challenging. In the context of current and upcoming galaxy surveys, the combination of void and halo statistics including their abundances, profiles and correlations should be effective in distinguishing modified gravity models that display different screening mechanisms.",1
65646,2,"Design of high gradient, high repetition rate damped C -band rf structures The gamma beam system of the European Extreme Light Infrastructure–Nuclear Physics project foresees the use of a multibunch train colliding with a high intensity recirculated laser pulse. The linac energy booster is composed of 12 traveling wave C-band structures, 1.8 m long with a field phase advance per cell of 2π/3 and a repetition rate of 100 Hz.

They are quasiconstant gradient structures with symmetric input couplers and a very effective damping of the HOMs in each cell based on silicon carbide (SiC) rf absorbers coupled to each cell through waveguides. An optimization of the electromagnetic and mechanical design has been done to simplify the fabrication and to reduce the cost of the structures.

We show that the statistical mechanics of such systems exhibit a striking resemblance to liquid crystals, with analogous ordered-nematic and disordered-isotropic phases. The ordered phase consists of bodies orbiting in a disk in both directions, with the disk thickness depending on temperature, while the disordered phase corresponds to a nearly isotropic distribution of the orbit normals. We show that below a critical value of the total angular momentum, the system undergoes a first-order phase transition between the ordered and disordered phases. At a critical point, the phase transition becomes second order, while for higher angular momenta there is a smooth crossover. We also find metastable equilibria containing two identical disks with mutual inclinations between 90° and 180°.",1

65824,2,"Topological invariants of Floquet systems: General formulation, special properties, and Floquet topological defects Periodically driven (Floquet) systems have been under active theoretical and experimental investigations. This paper aims at a systematic study in the following aspects of Floquet systems: (i) a systematic formulation of topological invariants of Floquet systems based on the cooperation of topology and symmetries. Topological invariants are constructed for the ten symmetry classes in all spatial dimensions, for both homogeneous Floquet systems (Floquet topological insulators and superconductors) and Floquet topological defects. Meanwhile, useful representative Dirac Hamiltonians for all the symmetry classes are obtained and studied. (ii) A general theory of Floquet topological defects, based on the proposed topological invariants. (iii) Models and proposals of Floquet topological defects in low dimensions. Among other defect modes, we investigate Floquet Majorana zero modes and Majorana Pi modes in vortices of topologically trivial superconductors under a periodic drive. In addition, we clarified several notable issues about Floquet topological invariants. Among other issues, we prove the equivalence between the effective-Hamiltonian-based band topological invariants and the frequency-domain band topological invariants.",1

65881,2,"An I/O controller for real time distributed tasks in particle accelerators SPES is a second generation ISOL radioactive ion beam facility in construction at the INFN National Laboratories of Legnaro (LNL). Its distributed control system embeds custom control in almost all instruments or cluster of homogeneous devices. Nevertheless, standardization is an important issue that concerns modularity and long term maintainability for a facility that has a life span of at least twenty years. In this context, the research project presented in this paper focuses on the design of a custom Input Output Controller (IOC) which acts as a local intelligent node in the distributed control network and is generic enough to perform several different tasks spanning from security and surveillance operations, beam diagnostic, data acquisition and data logging, real-time processing and trigger generation. The IOC exploits the Computer On Module (COM) Express standard that is available in different form factors and processors, fulfilling the computational power requirement of varied applications. The Intel x86_64 architecture makes software development straightforward, easing the portability. The result is a custom motherboard with several application specific features and generic PC functionalities. The design is modular to a certain extent, thanks to an hardware abstraction layer and allows the development of soft and hard real-time applications by means of a real-time Operating System and the on-board FPGA closely coupled to the CPU. Three PCIe slots, a FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) connector and several general-purpose digital/analog inputs/outputs enable functionality extensions. An optical fiber link connected to the FPGA is an high speed interface for high throughput data acquisitions or time-sensitive applications. The power distribution complies the AT standard and the whole board can be powered via Power Over Ethernet (POE+) IEEE 802.3at standard.

Observations with the Large Area Telescope detector on-board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope captured the γ-ray flux at energies 0.1 ≤ E_γ ≤ 300 GeV increasing fivefold during this period, with two distinct peaks in emission. The γ-ray emission is analysed in detail, in order to study the emission characteristics and put constraints on the location of the emission region. We explore variability in the spectral shape of 3C 454.3, search for evidence of a spectral cutoff, quantify the significance of very high energy emission and investigate whether or not an energy-dependence of the emitting electron cooling exists. γ-ray intrinsic doubling time-scales as small as τ_int = 0.68 ± 0.01 h at a significance of >5σ are found, providing evidence of a compact emission region. Significant E_γ, emitted ≥ 35 GeV and E_γ, emitted ≥ 50 GeV emission are also observed. The location of the emission region can be constrained to r ≥ 1.3 × $R_{{\rm BLR}}^{{\rm out}}$, a location outside the broad-line region.

Subsequently, adopting the best fitting values of the model parameters, we apply the original statefinder, statefinder hierarchy, the growth rate of matter perturbations and $Om(z)$ diagnostics to distinguish the TDDE scenarios and the $\Lambda$CDM scenario from each other. We discover that all the TDDE models and $\Lambda$CDM model can be distinguished better at the present epoch by using the statefinder hierarchy than using the original statefinder, the growth rate of matter perturbations and $Om(z)$ diagnostics, especially, in the planes of $\{S_3^{(1)},S_4^{(1)}\}$, $\{S_3^{(2)},S_4^{(2)}\}$, $\{S_5^{(1)},S_5^{(2)}\}$ and $\{S_4^{(2)},S_5^{(2)}\}$.",1
66129,2,"Through the big bang: Continuing Einstein's equations beyond a cosmological singularity All measurements are comparisons. The only physically accessible degrees of freedom (DOFs) are dimensionless ratios. The objective description of the universe as a whole thus predicts only how these ratios change collectively as one of them is changed. Here we develop a description for classical Bianchi IX cosmology implementing these relational principles. The objective evolution decouples from the volume and its expansion degree of freedom. We use the relational description to investigate both vacuum dominated and quiescent Bianchi IX cosmologies. In the vacuum dominated case the relational dynamical system predicts an infinite amount of change of the relational DOFs, in accordance with the well known chaotic behaviour of Bianchi IX. In the quiescent case the relational dynamical system evolves uniquely though the point where the decoupled scale DOFs predict the big bang/crunch. This is a non-trivial prediction of the relational description; the big bang/crunch is not the end of physics – it is instead a regular point of the relational evolution. Describing our solutions as spacetimes that satisfy Einstein's equations, we find that the relational dynamical system predicts two singular solutions of GR that are connected at the hypersurface of the singularity such that relational DOFs are continuous and the orientation of the spatial frame is inverted.",1

Utilizing this notion, we give pairs of normal crossing varieties and show that the pairs of smoothed Calabi-Yau manifolds satisfy the Hodge number relations of mirror symmetry.

We solve numerically the field equations then we obtain the behavior of some cosmological parameters such as the scale factor, the deceleration parameter and the energy density of the perfect fluid which is the matter field of our model.

66245,2,"Two No-Go Theorems on Superconductivity We study lattice superconductors such as attractive Hubbard models. As is well known, Bloch's theorem asserts absence of persistent current in ground states and equilibrium states for general fermion systems. While the statement of the theorem is true, we can show that the theorem cannot exclude possibility of a surface persistent current. Such a current can be stabilized by boundary magnetic fields which do not penetrate into the bulk region of a superconductor, provided emergence of massive photons, i.e., Meissner effect. Therefore, we can expect that a surface persistent current is realized for a ground/equilibrium state in the sense of stability against local perturbations. We also apply Elitzur's theorem to superconductors at finite temperatures. As a result, we prove absence of symmetry breaking of the global $U(1)$ phase of electrons for almost all gauge fields. These observations suggest that the nature of superconductivity is the emergence of massive photons rather than the symmetry breaking of the $U(1)$ phase of electrons.",1

This article reviews the instrumentation developments in particle and nuclear physics that have brought new understanding in those fields, their impact upon broader societal issues, and their interdependence with commercial advances. Subatomic physics shares with other basic sciences the need to innovate, invent, and develop tools, techniques, and technologies to carry out its mission to explore the nature of matter, energy, space, and time.

In most cases, however, the development of new devices and technologies by particle physics for its own research has added value to other fields of research or to applications beneficial to society by integrating them in the existing technologies. Thus, detector research and development has not only advanced the current state of technology for particle physics, but has often advanced research in other fields of science and has underpinned progress in numerous applications in medicine and national security. At the same time particle physics has profited immensely from developments in industry a nd applied them to great benefit for the use of particle physics detectors.

However, when q is a root of unity ( q=eiπ/p with integer p≥2 ), the Bethe equations acquire continuous solutions, and the transfer matrix develops Jordan cells. Hence, there appear eigenvectors of two new types: eigenvectors corresponding to continuous solutions (exact complete p -strings), and generalized eigenvectors.

In this medium energy range, ions are not fully relativistic, which means values of their relativistic beta are slightly below 1, leading to an energy dependence of revolution time of the collider ring. On the other hand, electrons with energy 3 GeV and above are already ultra-relativistic such that their speeds are effectively equal to the speed of light. The difference in speeds of colliding electrons and ions in JLEIC, when translated into a path-length difference necessary to maintain the same timing between electron and ion bunches, is quite large. In this paper, we explore schemes for synchronizing the electron and ion bunches at a collision point as the ion energy is varied.",1

These are examples of non-Fermi liquid states in d spatial dimensions. Our formalism allows us to treat the corresponding zero-temperature low-energy effective theory in a controlled approximation close to the upper critical dimension d=dc(m). The fixed points are identified from the RG flow equations, as functions of d and m. We find that the flow toward the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is preempted by Cooper pair formation for both the physical cases of (d=3,m=2) and (d=2,m=1). In fact, there is a strong enhancement of superconductivity by the order parameter fluctuations at the quantum critical point.",1

We compute the shear viscosity of the Ising-nematic critical point of metals in spatial dimension d=2 by an expansion below d=5/2. The anisotropy associated with directions parallel and normal to the Fermi surface leads to a violation of the scaling expectations: η scales in the same manner as a chiral conductivity, and the ratio η/s diverges at low temperature (T) as T−2/z, where z is the dynamic critical exponent for fermionic excitations dispersing normal to the Fermi surface.",1

Our analysis shows that while the widely used quantum approach is overall the best model, it does not completely describe all the data in this regime. Thus, these experimental findings may prompt seeking more generally valid methods to describe quantum radiation reaction.

In the classical limit the charge may be bound to the poles inside the minimum valley or well.

67186,2,"Two particle model for studying the effects of space-charge force on strong head-tail instabilities In this paper, we present a new two particle model for studying the strong head-tail instabilities in the presence of the space-charge force. It is a simple expansion of the well-known two particle model for strong head-tail instability and is still analytically solvable. No chromaticity effect is included. It leads to a formula for the growth rate as a function of the two dimensionless parameters: the space-charge tune shift parameter (normalized by the synchrotron tune) and the wakefield strength, ϒ. The three-dimensional contour plot of the growth rate as a function of those two dimensionless parameters reveals stopband structures. Many simulation results generally indicate that a strong head-tail instability can be damped by a weak space-charge force, but the beam becomes unstable again when the space-charge force is further increased. The new two particle model indicates a similar behavior. In weak space-charge regions, additional tune shifts by the space-charge force dissolve the mode coupling. As the space-charge force is increased, they conversely restore the mode coupling, but then a further increase of the space-charge force decouples the modes again. This mode coupling/decoupling behavior creates the stopband structures.",1
67250,2,"A original probe of dark matter in the core of M87 with the event horizon telescope We demonstrate the unprecedented capabilities of the Event Horizon Telescope
(EHT) to image the innermost dark matter profile in the vicinity of the
supermassive black hole at the center of the M87 radio galaxy. We present the
first model of the synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilations
from a spiky profile in the close vicinity of a supermassive black hole,
accounting for strong gravitational lensing effects. Our results show that the
EHT should readily resolve dark matter spikes if present. Moreover, the photon
ring surrounding the silhouette of the black hole is clearly visible in the
spike emission, which introduces observable small-scale structure into the
signal. We find that the dark matter-induced emission provides an adequate fit
to the existing EHT data, implying that in addition to the jet, a dark matter
spike may account for a sizable portion of the millimeter emission from the
innermost (sub-parsec) region of M87. Regardless, our results show that the EHT
can probe very weakly annihilating dark matter. Current EHT observations already

67257,2,Szekeres models: a covariant approach We exploit the 1  +  1  +  2 formalism to covariantly describe the inhomogeneous and anisotropic Szekeres models. It is shown that an average scale length can be defined covariantly which satisfies a 2d equation of motion driven from the effective gravitational mass (EGM) contained in the dust cloud. The contributions to the EGM are encoded to the energy density of the dust fluid and the free gravitational field E ( )ab( ). We show that the quasi-symmetric property of the Szekeres models is justified through the existence of 3 independent intrinsic Killing vector fields (IKVFs). In addition the notions of the apparent and absolute apparent horizons are briefly discussed and we give an alternative gauge-invariant form to define them in terms of the kinematical variables of the spacelike congruences. We argue that the proposed program can be used in order to express Sachs’ optical equations in a covariant form and analyze the confrontation of a spatially inhomogeneous irrotational overdense fluid model with the observational data.,1

It is probably true that experimentation with slow positrons would potentially have wide-ranging benefits comparable to those obtained with neutron and x-ray scattering, but it is certain that the full range of these benefits will never be fully available without an infrastructure comparable to that of existing neutron and x-ray facilities. The role for Jefferson Laboratory would therefore be to provide and maintain (1) a dedicated set of machines for making and manipulating high intensity, high brightness beams of polarized slow positrons; (2) a suite of unique and easily used instruments of wide utility that will make efficient use of the positrons; and (3) a group of on-site positron scientists to provide scientific leadership, instrument development, and user support.

67393,2,"Fast Radio Bursts The phenomenon of fast radio bursts (FRBs) was discovered in 2007. These are powerful (0.1-100 Jy) single radio pulses with durations of several milliseconds, large dispersion measures, and record high brightness temperatures suggesting coherent emission mechanism. As of time of writing, 32 FRBs were recorded. There is also one repeating source from which already hundreds of bursts have been detected. The FRB rate is estimated to amount up to several thousand per day over the sky, and their isotropic sky distribution likely suggests a cosmological origin. Since the discovery, different hypotheses on the possible FRB nature have been proposed, however up to now the origin of these transient events remains obscure. The most prospective models treat them as being related to a bursting emission from magnetars -- neutron stars whose activity is due to their magnetic field dissipation, -- or as being analogs of giant pulses observed from several radio pulsars . Future increase in the statistics of the observed FRBs and an improvement upon the FRB population characteristics will make possible to use them as a new tool to probe the intergalactic medium and to test fundamental physical theories.",1

67632,2,"Neutrino-heated winds from millisecond protomagnetars as sources of the weak r-process We explore heavy element nucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven winds from rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized protoneutron stars (‘millisecond protomagnetars’) for which the magnetic dipole is aligned with the rotation axis, and the field is assumed to be a static force-free configuration. We process the protomagnetar wind trajectories calculated by Vlasov, Metzger & Thompson through the r-process nuclear reaction network SkyNet using contemporary models for the evolution of the wind electron fraction during the protoneutron star cooling phase. Although we do not find a successful second or third-peak r-process for any rotation period P, we show that protomagnetars with P ∼ 1–5 ms produce heavy element abundance distributions that extend to higher nuclear mass number than from otherwise equivalent spherical winds (with the mass fractions of some elements enhanced by factors of ≳100–1000). The heaviest elements are synthesized by outflows emerging along flux tubes that graze the closed zone and pass near the equatorial plane outside the light cylinder. Due to dependence of the nucleosynthesis pattern on the magnetic field strength and rotation rate of the protoneutron star, natural variations in these quantities between core collapse events could contribute to the observed diversity of the abundances of weak r-process nuclei in metal-poor stars. Further diversity, including possibly even a successful third-peak r-process, could be achieved for misaligned rotators with non-zero magnetic inclination with respect to the rotation axis. If protomagnetars are central engines for GRBs, their relativistic jets should contain a high-mass fraction of heavy nuclei of characteristic mass number $$\skew4\bar{A}\approx 100$$, providing a possible source for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays comprised of heavy nuclei with an energy spectrum that extends beyond the nominal Grezin–Zatsepin–Kuzmin cut-off for protons or iron nuclei.",1

67769,2,"Effects of biases in domain wall network evolution. II. Quantitative analysis Domain walls form at phase transitions which break discrete symmetries. In a cosmological context, they often overclose the Universe (contrary to observational evidence), although one may prevent this by introducing biases or forcing anisotropic evolution of the walls. In a previous work [Correia et al., Phys. Rev. D 90, 023521 (2014)PRVDAQ1550-799810.1103/PhysRevD.90.023521], we numerically studied the evolution of various types of biased domain wall networks in the early Universe, confirming that anisotropic networks ultimately reach scaling while those with a biased potential or biased initial conditions decay. We also found that the analytic decay law obtained by Hindmarsh was in good agreement with simulations of biased potentials, but not of biased initial conditions, and suggested that the difference was related to the Gaussian approximation underlying the analytic law. Here, we extend our previous work in several ways. For the cases of biased potential and biased initial conditions, we study in detail the field distributions in the simulations, confirming that the validity (or not) of the Gaussian approximation is the key difference between the two cases. For anisotropic walls, we carry out a more extensive set of numerical simulations and compare them to the canonical velocity-dependent one-scale model for domain walls, finding that the model accurately predicts the linear scaling regime after isotropization. Overall, our analysis provides a quantitative description of the cosmological evolution of these networks.",1

In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the transformation, and present a new relaxed necessary and sufficient condition for the transformation to obtain the short-ranged potential in the assumption that the transformation converges in the far distance. Also, we discuss the peak location of the potential which is responsible for quasinormal mode frequencies in WKB analysis. Finally, in the extreme Kerr limit, a/M→1, where M and a denote the mass and spin parameter of a Kerr black hole, respectively, we find the peak location of the potential, rp/M≲1+1.8(1−a/M)1/2, by using the new transformation.

68060,2,"Experimental verification of a gain reduction model for the space charge effect in a wire chamber A wire chamber often suffers significant saturation of the multiplication factor when the electric field around its wires is strong. An analytical model of this effect has previously been proposed [Y. Arimoto et al., Nucl. Instrum. Meth. Phys. Res. A 799, 187 (2015)], in which the saturation was described by the multiplication factor, energy deposit density per wire length, and one constant parameter. In order to confirm the validity of this model, a multi-wire drift chamber was developed and irradiated by a MeV-range proton beam at the University of Tsukuba. The saturation effect was compared for energy deposits ranging from 70 keV/cm to 180 keV/cm and multiplication factors $$3\times 10^{3}$$ to $$3\times 10^{4}$$. The chamber was rotated with respect to the proton beam in order to vary the space charge density around the wires.

The two compatibility equations arising in this construction are found to be related to each other either by a parity transformation $\mathcal{P}$, by a time reversal $\mathcal{T}$ or a $\mathcal{PT}$-transformation possibly combined with a conjugation. We construct explicit multi-soliton solutions for these models by employing Hirota's direct method as well as Darboux-Crum transformations. The nonlocal nature of these models allows for a modification of these solution procedures as the new systems also possess new types of solutions with different parameter dependence and different qualitative behaviour.

Here we provide the first computation of the power spectrum of biased tracers in redshift space at one loop order, and we make the associated code publicly available. We compare the multipoles $\ell=0,2$ of the redshift-space halo power spectrum, together with the real-space matter and halo power spectra, with data from numerical simulations at $z=0.67$. For the samples we compare to, which have a number density of $\bar n=3.8 \cdot 10^{-2}(h \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1})^3$ and $\bar n=3.9 \cdot 10^{-4}(h \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1})^3$, we find that the calculation at one-loop order matches numerical measurements to within a few percent up to $k\simeq 0.43 \ h \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, a significant improvement with respect to former techniques. By performing the so-called IR-resummation, we find that the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation peak is accurately reproduced. Based on the results presented here, long-wavelength statistics that are routinely observed in LSS surveys can be finally computed in the EFTofLSS. This formalism thus is ready to start to be compared directly to observational data.",1

Kassiopeia features a new algorithmic paradigm for particle tracking simulations which targets experiments containing complex geometries and electromagnetic fields, with high priority put on calculation efficiency, customizability, extensibility, and ease-of-use for novice programmers. To solve Kassiopeia's target physics problem the software is capable of simulating particle trajectories governed by arbitrarily complex differential equations of motion, continuous physics processes that may in part be modeled as terms perturbing that equation of motion, stochastic processes that occur in flight such as bulk scattering and decay, and stochastic surface processes occurring at interfaces, including transmission and reflection effects. This entire set of computations takes place against the backdrop of a rich geometry package which serves a variety of roles, including initialization of electromagnetic field simulations and the support of state-dependent algorithm-swapping and behavioral changes as a particle’s state evolves. Thanks to the very general approach taken by Kassiopeia it can be used by other experiments facing similar challenges when calculating particle trajectories in electromagnetic fields.

68278,2,"FIPSER: Performance Study of a Readout Concept With Few Digitization Levels for Fast Signals We discuss the performance of a readout system, Fixed Pulse Shape Efficient Readout (FIPSER), to digitize signals from detectors with a fixed pulse shape. In this study we are mainly interested in the readout of fast photon detectors like photomultipliers or Silicon photomultipliers. But the concept can be equally applied to the digitization of other detector signals. FIPSER is based on the flash analog to digital converter (FADC) concept, but has the potential to lower costs and power consumption by using an order of magnitude fewer discrete voltage levels. Performance is bolstered by combining the discretized signal with the knowledge of the underlying pulse shape. Simulated FIPSER data was reconstructed with two independent methods. One using a maximum likelihood method and the other using a modified χ 2 test. Both methods show that utilizing 12 discrete voltage levels with a sampling rate of 4 samples per full width half maximum (FWHM) of the pulse achieves an amplitude resolution that is better than the Poisson limit for photon-counting experiments. The time resolution achieved in this configuration ranges between 0.02 and 0.16 FWHM and depends on the pulse amplitude. In a situation where the waveform is composed of two consecutive pulses the pulses can be separated if they are at least 0.05–0.30 FWHM apart with an amplitude resolution that is better than 20%.",1

A 1000Å CsI photocathode was deposited on a gold plated THGEM for photo-electron conversion. Charge-gain measurements were obtained with a Single-THGEM detector operating in these gas mixtures using a continuous UV lamp for the extraction of photo-electrons. Charge-gains in excess of 10(5) were obtained for gas mixtures containing percentages of quencher higher than 20% while photo-electron extraction efficiency achieved ~ 50% for He/CF(4) and ~ 30% for He/CH(4). Single photon electron measurements were also performed to assess the maximal gains reached in this regime. A discussion for future GPM cryogenic applications is presented.,1

68329,2,"A hybrid six-dimensional muon cooling channel using gas filled rf cavities An alternative cooling approach to prevent rf breakdown in magnetic fields is described that simultaneously reduces all six phase-space dimensions of a muon beam. In this process, cooling is accomplished by reducing the beam momentum through ionization energy loss in discrete absorbers and replenishing the momentum loss only in the longitudinal direction through gas-filled rf cavities. The advantage of gas filled cavities is that they can run at high gradients in magnetic fields without breakdown. With this approach, we show that our channel can achieve a decrease of the 6-dimensional phase-space volume by several orders of magnitude. With the aid of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the transmission of our proposed channel is comparable to that of an equivalent channel with vacuum rf cavities. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of the channel performance to the choice of gas and operating pressure.",1

The scalar curvature S of a left-invariant metric g is constant and can be expressed as a rational function in the parameters determining the metric. The critical points of S , subject to the volume constraint, are given by the zero locus of a system of polynomials in the parameters. In general, however, the determination of the zero locus is apparently out of reach. Instead, we consider the case where the isotropy group K of g in the group of motions is non-trivial.

Our results are based on Monte Carlo data gathered on system sizes up to L=79 (ca. three billion spins) for a wide range of temperatures near the critical point. We analyse the magnetisation distribution, the susceptibility and also the scaling and distribution of the size of the Fortuin–Kasteleyn cluster containing the origin.

Special attention is drawn to transition radiation (TR) generated during the traversal of thin metallic plate by the electron previously deflected from its initial direction of motion. In this case TR characteristics are calculated for realistic (circular) shape of the electron deflection trajectory. The difference of such characteristics under certain conditions from the ones obtained previously with the use of approximation of anglelike shape of the electron trajectory (instant deflection) is shown. The problem of measurement of bremsstrahlung characteristics in the prewave zone is investigated.

We measure the $\gamma$-ray spectrum averaged over strong flares much more accurately than before, and find it well modelled by Compton scattering of stellar radiation by relativistic electrons with the power law index of $\simeq$3.5 and a low-energy cutoff at the Lorentz factor of $\sim\!10^3$. We find a weaker spectrum in the soft spectral state, but only upper limits in the hard and intermediate states. We measure strong orbital modulation during the flaring state, well modelled by anisotropic Compton scattering of blackbody photons from the donor by jet relativistic electrons. We discover a weaker orbital modulation of the 15 GHz radio emission, which is well modelled by free-free absorption by the stellar wind. We then study cross-correlations between radio, $\gamma$-ray and X-ray emissions.

68575,2,"Feasibility of constraining the curvature parameter of the symmetry energy using elliptic flow data A QMD transport model that employs a modified momentum dependent interaction (MDI2) potential, supplemented by a phase-space coalescence model fitted to FOPI experimental multiplicities of free nucleons and light clusters is used to study the density dependence of the symmetry energy above the saturation point by a comparison with experimental elliptic flow ratios measured by the FOPI-LAND and ASYEOS Collaborations in$^{197}$Au +$^{197}$Au collisions at 400 MeV/nucleon impact energy. A previous calculation using the same model has proven that neutron-to-proton and neutron-to-charged-particles elliptic flow ratios probe on average different densities allowing in principle the extraction of both the slope L and curvature $K_{sym}$ parameters of the symmetry energy. To make use of this result a Gogny interaction inspired potential is modified by the addition of a density dependent, momentum independent term, while enforcing a close description of the empirical nucleon optical potential, allowing independent modifications of L and K$_{sym}$. Comparing theoretical predictions with experimental data for neutron-to-proton and neutron-to-charged-particles elliptic flow ratios the following constraint is extracted: $L = 85 \pm 22({\rm exp}) \pm 20({\rm th}) \pm 12({\rm sys})$ MeV and $K_{sym} = 96 \pm 315({\rm exp}) \pm 170({\rm th}) \pm 166({\rm sys})$ MeV. Theoretical errors include effects due to uncertainties in the isoscalar part of the equation of state, value of the isovector neutron-proton effective mass splitting, in-medium effects on the elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections, Pauli blocking algorithm variants and scenario considered for the conservation of the total energy of the system. Systematical uncertainties are generated by the inability of the transport model to reproduce experimental light-cluster-to-proton multiplicity ratios. A value for L free of systematical theoretical uncertainties can be extracted from the neutron-to-proton elliptic flow ratio alone: $ L = 84 \pm 30({\rm exp}) \pm 19({\rm th})$ MeV. It is demonstrated that elliptic flow ratios reach a maximum sensitivity on the $K_{sym}$ parameter in heavy-ion collisions of about 250 MeV/nucleon impact energy, allowing a reduction of its experimental component of uncertainty to about 150 MeV.",1

The timing resolution was determined by doing Gaussian fits to the time-of-flight of the particles between one or more UFSD and the trigger counter. For a single UFSD the resolution was measured to be 34 ps for a bias voltage of 200 V, and 27 ps for a bias voltage of 230 V. For the combination of 3 UFSD the timing resolution was 20 ps for a bias voltage of 200 V, and 16 ps for a bias voltage of 230 V.",1
68732,2,"Energy and Uncertainty in General Relativity The issue of energy and its potential localizability in general relativity has challenged physicists for more than a century. Many non-invariant measures were proposed over the years but an invariant measure was never found. We discovered the invariant localized energy measure by expanding the domain of investigation from space to spacetime. We note from relativity that the finiteness of the velocity of propagation of interactions necessarily induces indefiniteness in measurements. This is because the elements of actual physical systems being measured as well as their detectors are characterized by entire four-velocity fields, which necessarily leads to information from a measured system being processed by the detector in a spread of time. General relativity adds additional indefiniteness because of the variation in proper time between elements. The uncertainty is encapsulated in a generalized uncertainty principle, in parallel with that of Heisenberg, which incorporates the localized contribution of gravity to energy. This naturally leads to a generalized uncertainty principle for momentum as well. These generalized forms and the gravitational contribution to localized energy would be expected to be of particular importance in the regimes of ultra-strong gravitational fields. We contrast our invariant spacetime energy measure with the standard 3-space energy measure which is familiar from special relativity, appreciating why general relativity demands a measure in spacetime as opposed to 3-space. We illustrate the misconceptions by certain authors of our approach.",1
68768,2,"Planck intermediate results - L. Evidence of spatial variation of the polarized thermal dust spectral energy distribution and implications for CMB B-mode analysis The characterization of the Galactic foregrounds has been shown to be the main obstacle in thechallenging quest to detect primordial B-modes in the polarized microwave sky. We make use of the Planck-HFI 2015 data release at high frequencies to place new constraints on the properties of the polarized thermal dust emission at high Galactic latitudes. Here, we specifically study the spatial variability of the dust polarized spectral energy distribution (SED), and its potential impact on the determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. We use the correlation ratio of the CBBℓ angular power spectra between the 217 and 353 GHz channels as a tracer of these potential variations, computed on different high Galactic latitude regions, ranging from 80% to 20% of the sky. The new insight from Planck data is a departure of the correlation ratio from unity that cannot be attributed to a spurious decorrelation due to the cosmic microwave background, instrumental noise, or instrumental systematics. The effect is marginally detected on each region, but the statistical combination of all the regions gives more than 99% confidence for this variation in polarized dust properties. In addition, we show that the decorrelation increases when there is a decrease in the mean column density of the region of the sky being considered, and we propose a simple power-law empirical model for this dependence, which matches what is seen in the Planck data. We explore the effect that this measured decorrelation has on simulations of the BICEP2-Keck Array/Planck analysis and show that the 2015 constraints from these data still allow a decorrelation between the dust at 150 and 353 GHz that is compatible with our measured value. Finally, using simplified models, we show that either spatial variation of the dust SED or of the dust polarization angle are able to produce decorrelations between 217 and 353 GHz data similar to the values we observe in the data.

68836,2,"Renormalization of Sparse Disorder in the Ising Model We consider the renormalization of quenched bond disorder in the Ising model in the limit that it is sparse -- highly localized and vanishing in the thermodynamic limit. We begin in 1D with arbitrary disorder assigned to a finite number of bonds and study how the system renormalizes, finding non-trivial fixed point structure for any given bond with a separatrix at zero bond strength, equivalent to inserting a break in the chain. Either side of this critical line, renormalization group (RG) trajectories flow towards one of two attractors on which the disordered bonds settle onto ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic (AF) couplings of equal and opposite magnitude. Bonds that settle on an AF attractor are equivalent to inserting a twist in the chain at the location of the bond, implying a multi-kink ground state solution. Qualitatively different behavior emerges at the RG step when bonds start to coalesce, with the chain `untwisting' whenever two AF bonds coalesce. Our findings generalize to higher dimensions for codimension one defects that are sparse from the perspective of the orthogonal complement lattice. In 2D, the $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the model has an IR manifestation where one can construct field strengths and Wilson loops (which characterize frustration) from fundamental plaquette variables. In the non-sparse limit where the disorder parameter is drawn from an arbitrary but homogeneously assigned probability distribution function, we recover previously found fixed distributions as special cases, but find only the trivial paramagnetic distribution to be an attractor. For non-homogeneously assigned disorder that is sufficiently dilute however, we find the Edwards-Anderson model with equal probability $\pm J$ bonds to also be an IR attractor.",1
68893,2,"Mitigation of the Hose Instability in Plasma-Wakefield Accelerators Current models predict the hose instability to crucially limit the applicability of plasma-wakefield accelerators. By developing an analytical model which incorporates the evolution of the hose instability over long propagation distances, this work demonstrates that the inherent drive-beam energy loss, along with an initial beam-energy spread, detunes the betatron oscillations of beam electrons and thereby mitigates the instability. It is also shown that tapered plasma profiles can strongly reduce initial hosing seeds. Hence, we demonstrate that the propagation of a drive beam can be stabilized over long propagation distances, paving the way for the acceleration of high-quality electron beams in plasma-wakefield accelerators. We find excellent agreement between our models and particle-in-cell simulations.",1
68900,2,"Helical turbulent Prandtl number in the $A$ model of passive vector advection Using the field theoretic renormalization group technique in the two-loop approximation, turbulent Prandtl numbers are obtained in the general A model of passive vector advected by fully developed turbulent velocity field with violation of spatial parity introduced via the continuous parameter ρ ranging from ρ=0 (no violation of spatial parity) to |ρ|=1 (maximum violation of spatial parity). Values of A represent a continuously adjustable parameter which governs the interaction structure of the model. In nonhelical environments, we demonstrate that A is restricted to the interval −1.723≤A≤2.800 (rounded to 3 decimal places) in the two-loop order of the field theoretic model. However, when ρ>0.749 (rounded to 3 decimal places), the restrictions may be removed, which means that presence of helicity exerts a stabilizing effect onto the possible stationary regimes of the system. Furthermore, three physically important cases A∈{−1,0,1} are shown to lie deep within the allowed interval of A for all values of ρ. For the model of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations (A=−1) up to date unknown helical values of the turbulent Prandtl number have been shown to equal 1 regardless of parity violation. Furthermore, we have shown that interaction parameter A exerts strong influence on advection-diffusion processes in turbulent environments with broken spatial parity. By varying A continuously, we explain high stability of the kinematic MHD model (A=1) against helical effects as a result of its proximity to the A=0.912 (rounded to 3 decimal places) case where helical effects are completely suppressed. Contrary, for the physically important A=0 model, we show that it lies deep within the interval of models where helical effects cause the turbulent Prandtl number to decrease with |ρ|. We thus identify internal structure of interactions given by the parameter A, and not the vector character of the admixture itself being the dominant factor influencing diffusion-advection processes in the helical A model.",1

68928,2,"Kinetic theory of transport for inhomogeneous electron fluids The interplay between electronic interactions and disorder is neglected in the conventional Boltzmann theory of transport, yet can play an essential role in determining the resistivity of unconventional metals. When quasiparticles are long lived, one can account for these intertwined effects by solving spatially inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations. Assuming smooth disorder and neglecting umklapp scattering, we solve these inhomogeneous kinetic equations and compute the electrical resistivity across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic transition. An important consequence of electron-electron interactions is the modification of the momentum-relaxation time; this effect is ignored in the homogeneous theory. We characterize precisely when interactions enhance the momentum scattering rate, and when they decrease it. Our approach unifies existing semiclassical theories of transport, and explains how the resistivity can be proportional to the rate of momentum-conserving collisions without Baber scattering. We compare this result with existing transport mysteries, including the disorder-independent T2 resistivity of many Fermi liquids, and the linear-in-T “Planckian-limited” resistivity of many strange metals.",1
68942,2,"Role of the $\Delta$ Resonance in the Population of a Four-Nucleon State in the $^{56}$Fe $\to^{54}$Fe Reaction at Relativistic Energies The Fe54 nucleus was populated from a Fe56 beam impinging on a Be target with an energy of E/A=500  MeV. The internal decay via γ-ray emission of the 10+ metastable state was observed. As the structure of this isomeric state has to involve at least four unpaired nucleons, it cannot be populated in a simple two-neutron removal reaction from the Fe56 ground state. The isomeric state was produced in the low-momentum (-energy) tail of the parallel momentum (energy) distribution of Fe54, suggesting that it was populated via the decay of the Δ0 resonance into a proton. This process allows the population of four-nucleon states, such as the observed isomer. Therefore, it is concluded that the observation of this 10+ metastable state in Fe54 is a consequence of the quark structure of the nucleons.",1

69038,2,"Higher-order formulas of amplitude-dependent tune shift caused by a sextupole magnetic field distribution Nowadays, designs for ring-based light sources use multibend lattices for achieving a very small emittance of around 100 pmrad. In this type of storage ring, the chromaticity correcting sextupoles generally have greater strengths than those used in typical third-generation light sources. Therefore, controlling lattice nonlinearity such as amplitude-dependent tune shift (ADTS) is important for enabling stable operations and smooth beam commissioning. As the strength of the sextupoles increases, their higher-order terms contribute significantly to ADTS, rendering well-known lowest-order formulas inadequate for describing tune variations at large horizontal amplitudes. In response, we have derived explicit expressions of ADTS up to the fourth order in sextupole strength based on the canonical perturbation theory, assuming that the amplitude of a vertical betatron oscillation is smaller compared with the horizontal one. The new formulas express the horizontal and vertical betatron tune variations as functions of the action variables: Jx and Jy up to O(Jx2) and O(Jy). The derived formulas were applied to a five-bend achromat lattice designed for the SPring-8 upgrade. By comparing the calculated results with the tracking simulations, we found that (1) the formulas accurately express ADTS around a horizontal amplitude of ∼10  mm and (2) the nonlinear terms of the fourth order in sextupole strength govern the behaviors of circulating electrons at large horizontal amplitudes. In this paper, we present explicit expressions of fourth-order formulas of ADTS and provide some examples to illustrate their effectiveness.",1

We derive a catalog of 275 typical sGRBs and 48 sGRB 170817A-like weak events from the GBM data of 2217 GRBs. We visibly identify two patterns of their light curve, single episode (Pattern I, 61\% of the SGRBs) and multiple episodes (Pattern II, 39\% of the SGRBs). Their duration distribution shows a tentative bimodal feature. Their spectra can be fitted with a cutoff power-law model, except for 4 sGRBs, and the spectral indices normally distribute at $\Gamma=0.69\pm 0.40$. Their $E_p$ values show a tentative bimodal distribution with peaks at 145 keV and 500 keV. No correlation among $T_{90}$, $E_p$, and $\Gamma$ is found. GRB 170817A is a soft, weak sGRB with $ E_{p}=124\pm 106$ keV, $L_{\rm iso}=(5.67\pm4.65)\times10^{46}\rm ~erg~s^{-1}$, and $E_{\rm iso}=(3.23\pm2.65)\times10^{46}\rm ~erg$. It follows the $E_{\rm iso}-E_{\rm p}$ relation of typical short GRBs. Its lightcurve is of Pattern II. Two lightcurve patterns, together with the potential two components in the $E_{\rm p}$ and $T_{90}$ distributions, we suspect that the current sample may include two distinct types of sGRBs from different progenitors. sGRB 170817A-like events may be from NS-NS mergers and those sGRBs with a Pattern I lightcurve may be from another distinct type of compact binary.",1
69210,2,"Dark matter component decaying after recombination: Sensitivity to baryon acoustic oscillation and redshift space distortion probes It has been recently suggested [1] that a subdominant fraction of dark matter decaying after recombination may alleviate tension between high-redshift (CMB anisotropy) and low-redshift (Hubble constant, cluster counts) measurements. In this report, we continue our previous study [2] of the decaying dark matter (DDM) model adding all available recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift space distortions (RSD) measurements. We find that the BAO/RSD measurements generically prefer the standard ΛCDM and combined with other cosmological measurements impose an upper limit on the DDM fraction at the level of ∼5%, strengthening by a factor of 1.5 limits obtained in [2] mostly from CMB data. However, the numbers vary from one analysis to other based on the same Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 (DR12) galaxy sample. Overall, the model with a few percent DDM fraction provides a better fit to the combined cosmological data as compared to the ΛCDM: the cluster counting and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter are responsible for that. The improvement can be as large as 1.5σ and grows to 3.3σ when the CMB lensing power amplitude AL is introduced as a free fitting parameter.",1

69287,2,"Weak gravitation from a small extra 2D sphere In order to explain weak gravitation in our 4-dimensional universe, a 6-dimensional model with a small extra 2D sphere is proposed. The traceless energy-momentum tensor is quite naturally appeared in our 6-dimensional model. The warp factor is given by $\phi (\theta ) = \epsilon + \sin{\theta }$, where $\epsilon $ plays a role of killing the singular point $\phi (\theta )=0$, and is assumed $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$. Any massive particle is rolling down into points along this geodesic line. The light ray can be shown to stay in our 4-dimensional universe. This suggest us that our 4-dimensional world can be located at $\theta =0 $ and/or $\theta = \pi $, its background metric being $\epsilon ^2 \eta _{\mu \nu }$. As a result, we have the 4-dimensional Newton constant, which is given by $G_N \simeq G_6 \epsilon ^{10}$ and the fifth force coefficients appeared here are $\alpha _i\simeq \epsilon ^{2(i-4)}$, $i=1, 2, 3$. Here $G_6$ is the gravitational constant in 6-dimensional spacetime.

69412,2,Generation of a femtosecond electron microbunch train from a photocathode using twofold Michelson interferometer The interest in producing ultrashort electron bunches has risen sharply among scientists working on the design of high-gradient wakefield accelerators. One attractive approach generating electron bunches is to illuminate a photocathode with a train of femtosecond laser pulses. In this paper we describe the design and testing of a laser system for an rf gun based on a commercial titanium-sapphire laser technology. The technology allows the production of four femtosecond laser pulses with a continuously variable pulse delay. We also use the designed system to demonstrate the experimental generation of an electron microbunch train obtained by illuminating a cesium-telluride semiconductor photocathode. We use conventional diagnostics to characterize the electron microbunches produced and confirm that it may be possible to control the main parameter of an electron microbunch train.,1

We use voids traced by Luminous Red Galaxies in SDSS to demonstrate the methodology of testing these predictions. We find that the void central density parameter, as inferred from the lensing signal, can shift from its GR value by up to 20% in some galileon gravity models. Since this parameter can be estimated independently using the galaxy tracer profiles of voids, our method provides a consistency check of the gravity theory. Although galileon gravity is now disfavoured as a source of cosmic acceleration by other datasets, the methods we demonstrate here can be used to test for more general fifth force effects with upcoming void lensing data.",1

69726,2,"Nuclear response theory for spin-isospin excitations in a relativistic quasiparticle-phonon coupling framework A new theoretical approach to spin-isospin excitations in open-shell nuclei is presented. The developed method is based on the relativistic meson-exchange nuclear Lagrangian of Quantum Hadrodynamics and extends the response theory for superfluid nuclear systems beyond relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation in the proton-neutron channel (pn-RQRPA). The coupling between quasiparticle degrees of freedom and collective vibrations (phonons) introduces a time-dependent effective interaction, in addition to the exchange of pion and $ \rho$ -meson taken into account without retardation. The time-dependent contributions are treated in the resonant time-blocking approximation, in analogy to the previously developed relativistic quasiparticle time-blocking approximation (RQTBA) in the neutral (non-isospin-flip) channel. The new method is called proton-neutron RQTBA (pn-RQTBA) and is applied to the Gamow-Teller resonance in a chain of neutron-rich nickel isotopes$^{68-78}$Ni . A strong fragmentation of the resonance along with quenching of the strength, as compared to pn-RQRPA, is obtained. Based on the calculated strength distribution, beta-decay half-lives of the considered isotopes are computed and compared to pn-RQRPA half-lives and to experimental data. It is shown that a considerable improvement of the half-life description is obtained in pn-RQTBA because of the spreading effects, which bring the lifetimes to a very good quantitative agreement with data.",1

However, in the financial context there is no “speed limit” and the new parameter has the meaning of a characteristic diffusion speed at which relativistic effects become important and lead to a much softer asymptotic behavior, i.e., fat tails, giving rise to volatility smiles.

70008,2,"A New Data Access Mechanism for HDFS With the era of big data emerging, Hadoop has become the de facto standard of big data processing platform. However, it is still difficult to get legacy applications, such as High Energy Physics (HEP) applications, to run efficiently on Hadoop platform. There are two reasons which lead to the difficulties mentioned above: firstly, random access is not supported on Hadoop File System (HDFS), secondly, it is difficult to make legacy applications adopt to HDFS streaming data processing mode. In order to address the two issues, a new read and write mechanism of HDFS is proposed. With this mechanism, data access is done on the local file system instead of through HDFS streaming interfaces. To enable files modified by users, three attributes including permissions, owner and group are imposed on Block objects. Blocks stored on Datanodes have the same attributes as the file they are owned by. Users can modify blocks when the Map task running locally, and HDFS is responsible to update the rest replicas later after the block modification finished. To further improve the performance of Hadoop system, a complete localization task execution mechanism is implemented for I/O intensive jobs.

Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model with minimal neutrino mass ($\sum m_\nu = 0.06$ eV) we find $H_0=67.2^{+1.2}_{-1.0}$ km/s/Mpc (68% CL). This result is completely independent of Hubble constant measurements based on the distance ladder, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies (both temperature and polarization), and strong lensing constraints. There are now five data sets that: a) have no shared observational systematics; and b) each constrain the Hubble constant with a few percent level precision. We compare these five independent measurements, and find that, as a set, the differences between them are significant at the $2.1\sigma$ level ($\chi^2/dof=20.1/11$, probability to exceed=4%).

70148,2,"Tidal disruptions by rotating black holes: relativistic hydrodynamics with Newtonian codes We propose an approximate approach for studying the relativistic regime of stellar tidal disruptions by rotating massive black holes. It combines an exact relativistic description of the hydrodynamical evolution of a test fluid in a fixed curved space–time with a Newtonian treatment of the fluid's self-gravity. Explicit expressions for the equations of motion are derived for Kerr space–time using two different coordinate systems. We implement the new methodology within an existing Newtonian smoothed particle hydrodynamics code and show that including the additional physics involves very little extra computational cost. We carefully explore the validity of the novel approach by first testing its ability to recover geodesic motion, and then by comparing the outcome of tidal disruption simulations against previous relativistic studies. We further compare simulations in Boyer–Lindquist and Kerr–Schild coordinates and conclude that our approach allows accurate simulation even of tidal disruption events where the star penetrates deeply inside the tidal radius of a rotating black hole. Finally, we use the new method to study the effect of the black hole spin on the morphology and fallback rate of the debris streams resulting from tidal disruptions, finding that while the spin has little effect on the fallback rate, it does imprint heavily on the stream morphology, and can even be a determining factor in the survival or disruption of the star itself.

70227,2,"Muon excess following a gamma-ray burst event detected at the International Space Station At UT 2012-04-24 16:47:14, the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) of the Japanese Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) instrument on the International Space Station (ISS) detected a short x-ray transient lasting about 34 seconds. The MAXI/GSC transient was most likely a gamma-ray burst (GRB), because of the high galactic latitude, spectral hardness ratio and the absence of known bright x-ray source at the detected position. In addition, the MAXI/GSC transient coordinates were in the field of view of the inclined Tupi muon telescope located at ground (3 m above sea level) at in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. We report here that the Tupi telescope registered a muon excess with a signal significance 6.2 s within the MAXI/GMC transient time period. Assuming a power law function with a spectral index of -1.54 in the tail of the primary gamma ray energy spectrum, we can conclude that the fluence obtained from the muon excess detected by the Tupi telescope is consistent with the preliminarily value obtained by the MAXI team",1
70230,2,"Principal Shapes and Squeezed Limits in the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure We apply an orthogonalization procedure on the effective field theory of large scale structure (EFT of LSS) shapes, relevant for the angle-averaged bispectrum and non-Gaussian covariance of the matter power spectrum at one loop. Assuming natural-sized EFT parameters, this identifies a linear combination of EFT shapes—referred to as the principal shape—that gives the dominant contribution for the whole kinematic plane, with subdominant combinations suppressed by a few orders of magnitude. For the covariance, our orthogonal transformation is in excellent agreement with a principal component analysis applied to available data. Additionally we find that, for both observables, the coefficients of the principal shapes are well approximated by the EFT coefficients appearing in the squeezed limit, and are thus measurable from power spectrum response functions. Employing data from N-body simulations for the growth-only response, we measure the single EFT coefficient describing the angle-averaged bispectrum with 𝒪(10%) precision. These methods of shape orthogonalization and measurement of coefficients from response functions are valuable tools for developing the EFT of LSS framework, and can be applied to more general observables.",1
70252,2,"Post-Newtonian parameters γ and β of scalar-tensor gravity for a homogeneous gravitating sphere We calculate the parameters γ and β in the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism for scalar-tensor gravity (STG) with an arbitrary potential, under the assumption that the source matter is given by a nonrotating sphere of constant density, pressure, and internal energy. For our calculation we write the STG field equations in a form which is manifestly invariant under conformal transformations of the metric and redefinitions of the scalar field. This easily shows that also the obtained PPN parameters are invariant under such transformations. Our result is consistent with the expectation that STG is a fully conservative theory, i.e., only γ and β differ from their general relativity values γ=β=1, which indicates the absence of preferred frame and preferred location effects. We find that the values of the PPN parameters depend on both the radius of the gravitating mass source and the distance between the source and the observer. Most interestingly, we find that also at large distances from the source β does not approach β=1, but receives corrections due to a modified gravitational self-energy of the source. Finally, we compare our result to a number of measurements of γ and β in the Solar System. We find that in particular measurements of β improve the previously obtained bounds on the theory parameters, due to the aforementioned long-distance corrections.",1

70313,2,"Unwinding Short-Range Entanglement Symmetry-Protected Topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled (SRE) gapped phases of quantum matter protected by global symmetries, that cannot be unitarily and adiabatically deformed to a trivial phase without closing the gap or breaking symmetry. In this work, we show that, for several SPT phases, enlarging symmetries may effectively achieve the consequences of explicitly breaking symmetries. In other words, we demonstrate that non-trivial SPT phases can be unwound to trivial ones by \emph{symmetry extension} --- through a path where the Hilbert space is \emph{enlarged} and the Hamiltonian is invariant under an \emph{extended} symmetry group applying the idea of Wang-Wen-Witten [arXiv:1705.06728]. We show examples of both bosonic and fermionic SPT phases in 1+1 dimensions, including a Haldane spin chain and layers of Kitaev's Majorana fermionic chains. By adding degrees of freedom into the boundary/bulk, we can lift the zero mode degeneracy, or unwind the whole system. Furthermore, based on properties of Schur cover, we sketch a general picture of unwinding applicable to any 1+1D bosonic SPT phase protected by onsite finite symmetry. Altogether we show that SRE states can be unwound by \emph{symmetry breaking}, \emph{inversion} and \emph{symmetry extension}.",1

We find that the spin symmetry of the single-Λ spectrum maintains, which is consistent with experimental results of small spin-orbit splitting, whereas the approximate pseudospin symmetry is quite similar to that of nucleons. More interestingly, the ωΛΛ tensor coupling has opposite effects on these symmetries which makes the spin symmetry better but the pseudospin symmetry worse. This can be understood by the negative value of the ωΛΛ tensor potential, which reduces the spin-orbit potential while increasing the pseudospin-orbit potential.",1

70438,2,"A novel comparison of Møller and Compton electron-beam polarimeters We have performed a novel comparison between electron-beam polarimeters based on Møller and Compton scattering. A sequence of electron-beam polarization measurements were performed at low beam currents ( <5 μA ) during the Qweak experiment in Hall-C at Jefferson Lab. These low current measurements were bracketed by the regular high current ( 180 μA ) operation of the Compton polarimeter. All measurements were found to be consistent within experimental uncertainties of 1% or less, demonstrating that electron polarization does not depend significantly on the beam current. This result lends confidence to the common practice of applying Møller measurements made at low beam currents to physics experiments performed at higher beam currents. The agreement between two polarimetry techniques based on independent physical processes sets an important benchmark for future precision asymmetry measurements that require sub-1% precision in polarimetry.",1

70501,2,"Implications of a positive cosmological constant for general relativity Most of the literature on general relativity over the last century assumes that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is zero. However, by now independent observations have led to a consensus that the dynamics of the universe is best described by Einstein’s equations with a small but positive $\Lambda$ . Interestingly, this requires a drastic revision of conceptual frameworks commonly used in general relativity, no matter how small $\Lambda$ is.

70521,2,"Nonstandard Deformed Oscillators from $q$- and $p,q$-Deformations of Heisenberg Algebra For the two-parameter $p,q$-deformed Heisenberg algebra introduced recently and in which, instead of usual commutator of $X$ and $P$ in the l.h.s. of basic relation $[X,P] = {\rm i}\hbar$, one uses the $p,q$-commutator, we established interesting properties. Most important is the realizability of the $p,q$-deformed Heisenberg algebra by means of the appropriate deformed oscillator algebra. Another uncovered property is special extension of the usual mutual Hermitian conjugation of the creation and annihilation operators, namely the so-called $\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermitian conjugation rule, along with the related $\eta(N)$-pseudo-Hermiticity property of the position or momentum operators. In this work, we present some new solutions of the realization problem yielding new (nonstandard) deformed oscillators, and show their inequivalence to the earlier known solution and the respective deformed oscillator algebra, in particular what concerns ground state energy.",1
70565,2,"New proof of general relativity through the correct physical interpretation of the Mossbauer rotor experiment In this Essay, we give a correct interpretation of a historical experiment by Kundig on the transverse Doppler shift in a rotating system (Mossbauer rotor experiment). This experiment has been recently first reanalyzed, and then replied by an experimental research group. The results of reanalyzing the experiment have shown that a correct re-processing of Kundig's experimental data gives an interesting deviation of a relative redshift between emission and absorption resonant lines from the standard prediction based on the relativistic dilatation of time. Subsequent new experimental results by the reply of Kundig experiment have shown a deviation from the standard prediction even higher. By using the Equivalence Principle (EP), which states the equivalence between the gravitational ""force"" and the pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial frame of reference (included a rotating frame of reference), here the theoretical framework of the Mossbauer rotor experiment is reanalyzed directly in the rotating frame of reference through a general relativistic treatment. It will be shown that previous analyses missed an important effect of clock synchronization. By adding this new effect, the correct general relativistic prevision is in perfect agreement with the new experimental results. Such an effect of clock synchronization has been missed in various papers in the literature, with some subsequent claim of invalidity of the relativity theory and/or some attempts to explain the experimental results through ""exotic"" effects. The general relativistic interpretation in this Essay shows, instead, that the new experimental results of the Mossbauer rotor experiment are a new, strong and independent, proof of general relativity.",1
70724,2,"A simple test for stability of black hole by $S$-deformation We study a sufficient condition for proving the stability of a black hole when the master equation for linear perturbation takes the form of the Schrödinger equation. If the potential contains a small negative region, the S-deformation method is usually used to show the non-existence of an unstable mode. However, in some cases, it is hard to find an appropriate deformation function analytically because the only way found so far to find it is by trial-and-error. In this paper, we show that it is easy to find a regular deformation function by numerically solving the differential equation such that the deformed potential vanishes everywhere, when the spacetime is stable. Even if the spacetime is almost marginally stable, our method still works. We also discuss a simple toy model which can be solved analytically, and show that the condition for the non-existence of a bound state is the same as that for the existence of a regular solution for the differential equation in our method. From these results, we conjecture that our criteria is also a necessary condition.",1

Moreover, we run into the issue concerning the topological strength of a vortex-like structure and suggest an experimental realization, important to decide how to modify and measure the topological strength of the magnetic structure.",1
70926,2,"Lattice realization of a bosonic integer quantum Hall state–trivial insulator transition and relation to the self-dual line in the easy-plane NCCP1 model We provide an explicit lattice model of bosons with two separately conserved boson species [U(1)×U(1) global symmetry] realizing a direct transition between an integer quantum Hall effect of bosons and a trivial phase, where any intermediate phase is avoided by an additional symmetry interchanging the two species. If the latter symmetry is absent, we find intermediate superfluid phases where one or the other boson species condenses. We know the precise location of the transition since at this point our model has an exact nonlocal antiunitary particle-hole-like symmetry that resembles particle-hole symmetry in the lowest Landau level of electrons. We exactly map the direct transition to our earlier study of the self-dual line of the easy-plane NCCP1 model, in the mathematically equivalent reformulation in terms of two (new) particles with π statistics and identical energetics. While the transition in our model is first order, we hope that our mappings and recent renewed interest in such self-dual models will stimulate more searches for models with a continuous transition.",1
70955,2,"Microscopic simulation of xenon-based optical TPCs in the presence of molecular additives We introduce a simulation framework for the transport of high and low energy electrons in xenon-based optical time projection chambers (OTPCs).

The results compare positively with observations made in pure xenon and its mixtures with CO2 and CF4 in a range of pressures from 0.1 to 10 bar.

70976,2,"Pulsars as a tool to detect event horizons Spinning collapsed objects like Kerr black holes or naked singularities cause the spin axes of pulsars in their vicinity to precess significantly due to frame-dragging. Here we report that the spin-precession rate, and hence the observed pulse rate, of such a pulsar moving in a circular orbit near an event horizon rises sharply as the orbit shrinks. This provides a new way to detect such a horizon, not only from an observed high electromagnetic pulse rate, but also from a plausible detection of gravitational waves due to the increased pulsar spin. The pulsar, approaching the event horizon, should eventually be disrupted causing a new astronomical phenomenon, which we call a spin-precessional disruption event (SPDE). We argue that a significant difference between the radioactive glow of an SPDE and that of a tidal disruption event of a pulsar near a naked singularity could distinguish such a singularity from a black hole.",1

We found that the spin period of millisecond pulsar (MSP) can stop at the value of several milliseconds, if the accretion spin-up torque balances the spin-down torque by the GW radiation. Furthermore, we obtained the minimum spin period of MSP and its relation to the deformation ellipticity of NS that accounts for the NS mass quadrupole moment. The comparisons between the pulsar observations and the model results are discussed in the diagram of magnetic field versus spin period, and the consistency can be obtained.",1

71322,2,"An evolving GeV spectrum from prompt to afterglow: the case of GRB 160509A We present the high-energy emission properties of GRB 160509A, from its prompt mission to late afterglow phase. GRB 160509A contains two emission episodes: 0–40 s and 280–420 s after the burst onset (${t}_{0}$). The relatively high fluence of GRB 160509A allows us to establish an evolving spectrum above 100 MeV. During the first emission episode, the >100 MeV spectrum is soft with Γ ≥ 3.0, which can be smoothly connected to keV energies with a Band function with or without a high-energy cutoff. The >100 MeV spectrum rapidly changes to a hard spectrum with Γ ≤ 1.5 after ${t}_{0}+40$ s. The existence of very energetic photons, e.g., a 52 GeV that arrives at ${t}_{0}+77$ s and a 29 GeV that arrives at ${t}_{0}+70$ ks, is hard to reconcile by the synchrotron emission from forward-shock electrons, but is likely due to an inverse-Compton (IC) mechanism (e.g., synchrotron self-Compton emission). A soft spectrum (Γ ∼ 2) between 300 and 1000 s after the burst onset is also found at a significance of about 2 standard deviations, which suggests a different emission mechanism at work for this short period of time. GRB 160509A represents the latest example where IC emission has to be taken into account in explaining the afterglow GeV emission, which had been suggested long before the launch of the Fermi Large Area Telescope.",1
71388,2,"Linear magnetochiral effect in Weyl semimetals We suggest the possibility of a linear magnetochiral effect in time reversal breaking Weyl semimetals. The magnetochiral effect consists of the simultaneous linear dependence of the magnetotransport coefficients with a magnetic field and a momentum vector. This simultaneous dependence is allowed by the Onsager reciprocity relations, being the separation vector between the Weyl nodes that plays such a role. The presence of band-bending terms in the dispersion relation of generalized Weyl fermions is responsible for the magnetochiral effect. This linear magnetochiral effect constitutes a transport effect associated with the topological structures linked to time reversal breaking Weyl semimetals.",1
71393,2,"New Advances in the Modelling of Pulsar Magnetospheres The wealth of high-energy (E > 50 MeV) and very-high-energy (E > 100 GeV) data accumulated over the past few years have provided unprecedented opportunities to probe pulsar emission models. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has now detected over 200 gamma-ray pulsars of vastly different ages, providing an extensive dataset of spectra and light curves compared to a mere decade ago. Ground-based Cherenkov telescopes deepened our appreciation of the mysterious richness of the pulsar mechanism by a surprise detection of pulsed emission up to 1 TeV from the Crab pulsar. These discoveries position us to make real progress in pulsar theory. A number of studies have developed new and enhanced existing dissipative magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and particle-in-cell (PIC) codes to solve the global electrodynamics and pursue fundamental questions about magnetospheric particle injection, acceleration, and radiation. While MHD models capture the global aspects of pulsar magnetospheres, the microphysics need to be probed self-consistently by PIC simulations. Some dissipative MHD models consider the current sheet (CS) as an important site for high-energy curvature radiation (CR), while early PIC results point to energy dissipation taking place in the CS, where particles are accelerated by magnetic reconnection and may possibly emit $\gamma$ rays via synchrotron radiation (SR). This is in marked contrast to some older local emission models that studied CR gamma rays produced in gaps nearer to the spinning neutron star. The universality of these results should become clearer as current computational restrictions are overcome and boundary conditions are refined. Continued and combined polarimetric, spectral, and temporal measurements should aid us in scrutinising these new emission models in our persistent pursuit of a deeper understanding of the pulsar marvel.",1

71407,2,"Two coexisting families of compact stars: observational implications for millisecond pulsars It is usually thought that a single equation of state (EoS) model “correctly” represents cores of all compact stars. Here we emphasize that two families of compact stars, viz., neutron stars and strange stars, can coexist in nature, and that neutron stars can get converted to strange stars through the nucleation process of quark matter in the stellar center. From our fully general relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning compact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar conversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of these stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new mechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher spin rates. This could have an implication for the observed mass and spin distributions of millisecond pulsars. Such a stellar conversion can also rescue some massive, spin-supported millisecond pulsars from collapsing into black holes. Besides, we extend the concept of critical mass ${M}_{\mathrm{cr}}$ for the neutron star sequence to the case of fast-spinning neutron stars, and point out that neutron star EoS models cannot be ruled out by the stellar mass measurement alone. Finally, we emphasize the additional complexity for constraining EoS models, for example, by stellar radius measurements using X-ray observations, if two families of compact stars coexist.",1

We pay particular attention to the role of GR and gravity in cosmology, one of the areas in which one gravity dominates and new phenomena and effects challenge the orthodoxy. We also review other areas where there are likely conflicts pointing to the need to replace or revise GR to represent correctly observations and consistent theoretical framework.

71627,2,"Hubble Diagrams in the Jordan and Einstein Frames Different models in cosmology generally predict different Hubble diagrams. Then, the comparison between the Hubble diagrams may be used as a way for distinguishing between different cosmological scenarios. But that is not always the case because there is no guarantee that two different models always have different Hubble diagrams. It may be possible for two physically-inequivalent models to have the same Hubble diagrams. In that case, the Hubble diagram cannot be used to differentiate between two models and it is necessary to find another way to distinguish between them. Therefore, the question of whether two different scenarios are distinguishable by using the Hubble diagrams is an important question which would not have an obvious answer. The Jordan and Einstein frames of $f(R)$ theories of gravity are inequivalent, provided that the metricity condition holds in both frames. In the present paper it is argued that if the time-variation of particle masses in the Einstein frame is taken into consideration, the Hubble diagram derived practically from type Ia supernova surveys does not enable us to differentiate between these two frames. Nevertheless, we show that by waiting long enough to measure the change in Hubble diagram it is possible to differentiate between two frames. In other words, the Hubble diagram cannot be employed alone to differentiate between two frames but comparison between the rates of changes in Hubble diagrams can provide a way to do so.",1

The deflection angle of light is obtained by studying the intrinsic geometry of the spatial equatorial plane in the Reissner–Nordstrom–de Sitter spacetime.

71700,2,"Hydrodynamics of local excitations after an interaction quench in 1D cold atomic gases We discuss the hydrodynamic approach to the study of the time evolution—induced by a quench—of local excitations in one dimension. We focus on interaction quenches: the considered protocol consists of creating a stable localized excitation propagating through the system, and then operating a sudden change of the interaction between the particles. To highlight the effect of the quench, we take the initial excitation to be a soliton. The quench splits the excitation into two packets moving in opposite directions, whose characteristics for short times can be expressed in a universal way. Our treatment allows for the description of the internal dynamics of these two packets in terms of the different velocities of their components. We confirm our analytical predictions through numerical simulations performed with the Gross–Pitaevskii equation and with the Calogero model (as an example of long range interactions and solvable with a parabolic confinement). Through the Calogero model we also discuss the effect of an external trapping on the protocol. The hydrodynamic approach shows that there is a difference between the bulk velocities of the propagating packets and the velocities of their peaks: it is possible to discriminate the two quantities, as we show through the comparison between numerical simulations and analytical estimates. We show that our analytical results capture with remarkable precision the findings of the numerical simulations also for intermediate times and we provide predictions for the time at which the two packets becomes distinguishable. In the realizations of the discussed quench protocol in a cold atom experiment, these different velocities are accessible through different measurement procedures.",1

71754,2,"Study of the Beam-Cavity Interaction in the PS 10 MHz RF System The eleven main accelerating cavities of the Proton Synchrotron (PS) at CERN consist of two ferrite-loaded coaxial λ/4 resonators each. Both resonators oscillate in phase, as their gaps are electrically connected by short bars. They are in addition magnetically coupled via the bias loop used for cavity tuning. The cavities are equipped with a wide-band feedback system, limiting the beam loading, and a further reduction of the beam induced voltage is achieved by relays which short-circuit each half-resonator gap when the cavity is not in use. Asymmetries of the beam induced voltage observed in the two half-cavities indicate that the coupling between the two resonators is not as tight as expected. The total cavity impedance coupling to the beam may be affected differently by the contributions of both resonators. A dedicated measurement campaign with high-intensity proton beam and numerical simulation have been performed to investigate the beam-cavity interaction.

71786,2,"Making maps of Cosmic Microwave Background polarization for B-mode studies: the POLARBEAR example Analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) datasets typically requires some filtering of the raw time-ordered data. For instance, in the context of ground-based observations, filtering is frequently used to minimize the impact of low frequency noise, atmospheric contributions and/or scan synchronous signals on the resulting maps. In this work we have explicitly constructed a general filtering operator, which can unambiguously remove any set of unwanted modes in the data, and then amend the map-making procedure in order to incorporate and correct for it. We show that such an approach is mathematically equivalent to the solution of a problem in which the sky signal and unwanted modes are estimated simultaneously and the latter are marginalized over. We investigated the conditions under which this amended map-making procedure can render an unbiased estimate of the sky signal in realistic circumstances. We then discuss the potential implications of these observations on the choice of map-making and power spectrum estimation approaches in the context of B-mode polarization studies. Specifically, we have studied the effects of time-domain filtering on the noise correlation structure in the map domain, as well as impact it may haveon the performance of the popular pseudo-spectrum estimators. We conclude that although maps produced by the proposed estimators arguably provide the most faithful representation of the sky possible given the data, they may not straightforwardly lead to the best constraints on the power spectra of the underlying sky signal and special care may need to be taken to ensure this is the case. By contrast, simplified map-makers which do not explicitly correct for time-domain filtering, but leave it to subsequent steps in the data analysis, may perform equally well and be easier and faster to implement. We focused on polarization-sensitive measurements targeting the B-mode component of the CMB signal and apply the proposed methods to realistic simulations based on characteristics of an actual CMB polarization experiment, POLARBEAR. Our analysis and conclusions are however more generally applicable. Key words: cosmic background radiation / cosmology: observations",1

Data analysis is based on full charge pulse shape recording using digital oscilloscope.

71867,2,"Causality and existence of solutions of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics with gravity A new approach is described to help improve the foundations of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics and its coupling to general relativity. Focusing on neutral conformal fluids constructed solely in terms of hydrodynamic variables, we derive the most general viscous energy-momentum tensor yielding equations of motion of second order in the derivatives, which is shown to provide a novel type of resummation of the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations for which causality holds. We rigorously prove existence, uniqueness, and causality of solutions of this theory (in the full nonlinear regime) both in a Minkowski background and also when the fluid is dynamically coupled to Einstein's equations. Linearized disturbances around equilibrium in Minkowski spacetime are stable in this causal theory and the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied. A numerical study reveals the presence of a hydrodynamic attractor for a rapidly expanding fluid. Further properties are also studied and a brief discussion of how this approach can be generalized to non-conformal fluids is presented.",1
71882,2,"The final spin from binary black holes in quasi-circular orbits We revisit the problem of predicting the spin magnitude and direction of the black hole (BH) resulting from the merger of two BHs with arbitrary masses and spins inspiraling in quasi-circular orbits. We do this by analyzing a catalog of 619 recent numerical-relativity simulations collected from the literature and spanning a large variety of initial conditions. By combining information from the post-Newtonian approximation, the extreme mass-ratio limit, and perturbative calculations, we improve our previously proposed phenomenological formulae for the final remnant spin. In contrast with alternative suggestions in the literature, and in analogy with our previous expressions, the new formula is a simple algebraic function of the initial system parameters and is not restricted to binaries with spins aligned/anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum but can be employed for fully generic binaries. The accuracy of the new expression is significantly improved, especially for almost extremal progenitor spins and for small mass ratios, yielding an rms error σ ≈ 0.002 for aligned/anti-aligned binaries and σ ≈ 0.006 for generic binaries. Our new formula is suitable for cosmological applications and can be employed robustly in the analysis of the gravitational waveforms from advanced interferometric detectors.",1
71948,2,"Dissipationless conductance in a topological coaxial cable We present a dynamical mechanism leading to dissipationless conductance, whose quantized value is controllable in a (3+1)-dimensional electronic system. The mechanism is exemplified by a theory of Weyl fermions coupled to a Higgs field, also known as an axion insulator. We show that the insertion of an axial gauge flux can induce vortex lines in the Higgs field, similar to the development of vortices in a superconductor upon the insertion of magnetic flux. We further show that the necessary axial gauge flux can be generated using Rashba spin-orbit coupling or a magnetic field. Vortex lines in the Higgs field are known to bind chiral fermionic modes, each of which serves as a one-way channel for electric charge with conductance e2/h. Combining these elements, we present a physical picture, the “topological coaxial cable,” illustrating how the value of the quantized conductance could be controlled in such an axion insulator.",1

Latta (JCAP 12 (2015) 010), are then re-obtained as particular cases. Additionally, we select other values for the non-GR parameters which are consistent with current constraints, getting a very rich phenomenology. In particular, we find solutions with infinite shear, zero curvature, and infinite matter energy density in comparison with the Hubble scalar. We also have stiff-like future attractors, anisotropic late-time attractors, or both, in some special cases. Such results are developed analytically, and then verified by numerics. Finally, the physical interpretation of the new critical points is discussed.",1
71992,2,"The 2-Hilbert Space of a Prequantum Bundle Gerbe We construct a prequantum 2-Hilbert space for any line bundle gerbe whose Dixmier–Douady class is torsion. Analogously to usual prequantization, this 2-Hilbert space has the category of sections of the line bundle gerbe as its underlying 2-vector space. These sections are obtained as certain morphism categories in Waldorf’s version of the 2-category of line bundle gerbes. We show that these morphism categories carry a monoidal structure under which they are semisimple and abelian. We introduce a dual functor on the sections, which yields a closed structure on the morphisms between bundle gerbes and turns the category of sections into a 2-Hilbert space. We discuss how these 2-Hilbert spaces fit various expectations from higher prequantization. We then extend the transgression functor to the full 2-category of bundle gerbes and demonstrate its compatibility with the additional structures introduced. We discuss various aspects of Kostant–Souriau prequantization in this setting, including its dimensional reduction to ordinary prequantization.",1

72124,2,"On the $C^k$-embedding of Lorentzian manifolds in Ricci-flat spaces In this paper, we investigate the problem of non-analytic embeddings of Lorentzian manifolds in Ricci-flat semi-Riemannian spaces. In order to do this, we first review some relevant results in the area and then motivate both the mathematical and physical interests in this problem. We show that any n-dimensional compact Lorentzian manifold (Mn, g), with g in the Sobolev space Hs+3, s>n2, admits an isometric embedding in a (2n + 2)-dimensional Ricci-flat semi-Riemannian manifold. The sharpest result available for these types of embeddings, in the general setting, comes as a corollary of Greene’s remarkable embedding theorems R. Greene [Mem. Am. Math. Soc. 97, 1 (1970)], which guarantee the embedding of a compact n-dimensional semi-Riemannian manifold into an n(n + 5)-dimensional semi-Euclidean space, thereby guaranteeing the embedding into a Ricci-flat space with the same dimension. The theorem presented here improves this corollary in n2 + 3n − 2 codimensions by replacing the Riemann-flat condition with the Ricci-flat one from the beginning. Finally, we will present a corollary of this theorem, which shows that a compact strip in an n-dimensional globally hyperbolic space-time can be embedded in a (2n + 2)-dimensional Ricci-flat semi-Riemannian manifold.",1

72286,2,"Five-dimensional perspective on Higgs physics and the b→sγ transition in a warped extra dimension This thesis studies the Higgs-boson production and decay processes as well as the flavorchanging
neutral current b → sγ in models with one warped extra dimension, where the
gauge bosons and fermions propagate into the bulk and the Higgs sector is localized on
or near the infra-red brane. These so-called Randall-Sundrum models present attractive
scenarios beyond the Standard Model of particle physics that can address the disparity
between the electroweak and the Planck scale. Furthermore, these models provide a
natural explanation for the hierarchical pattern observed in the flavor sector and the
smallness of flavor-changing neutral currents.
In order to search for hints of a warped extra dimension this work mainly focuses on
loop-induced processes, which can receive significant contributions from the exchange
of heavy Kaluza-Klein resonances in the loops. Working in the five-dimensional (5D)
framework, the Feynman amplitudes of the Higgs-production process via gluon fusion
gg → h, the Higgs decay into two photons h → γγ and the electromagnetic dipole
transition b → sγ are expressed in terms of integrals over fermion and gauge-boson
5D propagators. Using 5D propagators avoids the notion of infinite sums over KaluzaKlein
states and allows to obtain analytically closed expressions valid to all orders in
an expansion of v2/M2 KK. The fermion 5D propagator is derived by retaining the full
dependence of the Yukawa matrices and by regularizing the profile of the Higgs vacuum
expectation value by a square box of width η and height 1/η with η ≪ v|Yq|/MKK.
It is shown that the amplitude of the fermion triangle diagram that contributes to
gg → h and h → γγ depends on the localization of the Higgs sector on or near the infrared
brane. This leads to a classification of different Randall-Sundrum models according to
the parametric relation of the characteristic width of the Higgs-boson profile with respect
to the two ratios v|Yq|/MKK and v|Yq|/ΛTeV, where ΛTeV is the ultra-violet cutoff near
the infra-red brane. In the phenomenological part of this thesis corrections to the treelevel
cW , cZ, ct, cb, cτ and loop-induced effective ceff g, ceff γ Higgs couplings are compared
with fit results of experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider. Furthermore,
modifications of the signal rates of the processes pp → h → b¯b,τ +τ−,WW∗,ZZ∗ ,γγ are
analyzed, which can exclude large fractions of the Randall-Sundrum parameter space.
Finally, the loop-induced electro- and chromomagnetic dipole coefficients C7γ,8g and
their chirality-flipped counterparts C˜ 7γ,8g are investigated at one-loop order. The main
corrections from virtual Kaluza-Klein modes arise from the scalar part of the W-boson
penguin diagrams, which includes the contributions from the fifth component of the 5D
gauge boson and from the charged Nambu-Goldstone bosons in the Higgs sector. For the
phenomenological analysis the dipole coefficients are renormalization-group evolved to
the B-meson scale while taking into account the mixing effects between the electro- and
chromomagnetic dipole operators. The branching ratio for the inclusive decay B¯ → Xsγ
and the time-dependent CP asymmetry in B¯0 d → K¯ ∗0γ are studied, showing that sizeable
corrections can only occur for large values of the entries of the anarchic 5D Yukawa
matrices.",1
72300,2,"Conditional Mutual Information of Bipartite Unitaries and Scrambling One way to diagnose chaos in bipartite unitary channels is via the tripartite information of the corresponding Choi state, which for certain choices of the subsystems reduces to the negative conditional mutual information (CMI). We study this quantity from a quantum information-theoretic perspective to clarify its role in diagnosing scrambling. When the CMI is zero, we find that the channel has a special normal form consisting of local channels between individual inputs and outputs. However, we find that arbitrarily low CMI does not imply arbitrary proximity to a channel of this form, although it does imply a type of approximate recoverability of one of the inputs. When the CMI is maximal, we find that the residual channel from an individual input to an individual output is completely depolarizing when the other input is maximally mixed. However, we again find that this result is not robust. We also extend some of these results to the multipartite case and to the case of Haar-random pure input states. Finally, we look at the relationship between tripartite information and its Rényi-2 version which is directly related to out-of-time-order correlation functions. In particular, we demonstrate an arbitrarily large gap between the two quantities.",1

In this paper we give a systematic characterisation of a vacuum type D initial data set. By systematic we mean that the only quantities involved are those appearing in the vacuum constraints, namely the first fundamental form (Riemannian metric) and the second fundamental form. Our characterisation is a set of conditions consisting of the vacuum constraints and some additional differential equations for the first and second fundamental forms These conditions can be regarded as a system of partial differential equations on a Riemannian manifold and the solutions of the system contain all possible regular vacuum type D initial data sets. As an application we particularise our conditions for the case of vacuum data whose data development is a subset of the Kerr solution. This has applications in the formulation of the nonlinear stability problem of the Kerr black hole.",1
72335,2,"Method to select gamma rays with energy above 50 GeV against a charge-particle background in the GAMMA-400 space telescope Studying high-energy (>50GeV) cosmic gamma radiation raises a problem of selection of neutral gamma rays from a background of charged particles. The problem is embarrassed by the backsplash effect. The backsplash consists, in the main, of low-energy (1 MeV) secondary photons moving backwards and is produced by any high-energy gamma quantum. A charged-particle rejection method using the anticoincidence and time-of-flight systems is proposed. Charged-particle events are distinguished from those being triggered by high-energy gamma-rays producing backsplash. The method is based on the time separation of signals. It allows us to keep the gamma-ray detection efficiency high up to high energies.",1
72356,2,"Entanglement and quantum transport in integrable systems Understanding the entanglement structure of out-of-equilibrium many-body systems is a challenging yet revealing task. Here we investigate the entanglement dynamics after an inhomogeneous quench in integrable systems. This is the prototypical setup for studying quantum transport, and it consists in the sudden junction of two macroscopically different states. By exploiting the recently developed integrable hydrodynamic approach and the quasiparticle picture for the entanglement dynamics, we conjecture a formula for the entanglement production rate after joining two semi-infinite reservoirs, as well as the steady-state entanglement entropy of a finite subregion. We show that both quantities are determined by the quasiparticles created in the Non Equilibrium steady State (NESS) appearing at large times at the interface between the two reservoirs. Specifically, the steady-state entropy coincides with the thermodynamic entropy of the NESS, whereas the entropy production rate reflects its spreading into the bulk of the two reservoirs. Our results are numerically corroborated using tDMRG simulations in the paradigmatic XXZ spin-$1/2$ chain.",1
72403,2,"Simple Fermionic Model of Deconfined Phases and Phase Transitions Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study a series of models of fermions coupled to quantum Ising spins on a square lattice with N flavors of fermions per site for N=1, 2, and 3. The models have an extensive number of conserved quantities but are not integrable, and they have rather rich phase diagrams consisting of several exotic phases and phase transitions that lie beyond the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. In particular, one of the prominent phases for N>1 corresponds to 2N gapless Dirac fermions coupled to an emergent Z2 gauge field in its deconfined phase. However, unlike a conventional Z2 gauge theory, we do not impose “Gauss’s Law” by hand; instead, it emerges because of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Correspondingly, unlike a conventional Z2 gauge theory in two spatial dimensions, our models have a finite-temperature phase transition associated with the melting of the order parameter that dynamically imposes the Gauss’s law constraint at zero temperature. By tuning a parameter, the deconfined phase undergoes a transition into a short-range entangled phase, which corresponds to Néel antiferromagnet or superconductor for N=2 and a valence-bond solid for N=3. Furthermore, for N=3, the valence-bond solid further undergoes a transition to a Néel phase consistent with the deconfined quantum critical phenomenon studied earlier in the context of quantum magnets.",1

The observations were dedicated to the search of the radio counterpart of the evolved pulsar wind nebula (PWN) HESS J1303−631, which has been detected in X-rays and GeV–TeV γ-rays. The collected data do not reveal any significant extended emission associated with PSR J1301−6305. In addition, archival 1.384 GHz and 2.368 GHz data do not show any evidence for a radio counterpart of HESS J1303−631. Archival 1.384 GHz observations reveal the detection of an extended structure centred at an angular distance of 19′ from the pulsar. This extended structure might be a supernova remnant (SNR) and a potential birth place of PSR J1301−6305.

72591,2,"A Model of the Collapse and Evaporation of Charged Black Holes In this paper, a natural generalization of KMY model is proposed for the evaporation of charged black holes. Within the proposed model, the back reaction of Hawking radiation is considered. More specifically, we consider the equation $G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi \langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle$, in which the matter content $\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle$ is assumed spherically symmetric. With this equation of motion, the asymptotic behavior of the model is analyzed. Two kinds of matter contents are taken into consideration in this paper. In the first case (the thin-shell model), the infalling matter is simulated by a null-like charged sphere collapsing into its center. In the second case, we consider a continuous distribution of spherical symmetric infalling null-like charged matter. It is simulated by taking the continuous limit of many co-centric spheres collapsing into the center. We find that in the thin-shell case, an event horizon forms and the shell passes through the horizon before becoming extremal, provided that it is not initially near-extremal. In the case of continuous matter distribution, we consider explicitly an extremal center covered by neutral infalling matter and find that the event horizon also forms. The black hole itself will become near-extremal eventually, leaving possibly a non-electromagnetic energy residue less than the order of $\ell_{p}^{4}/e_{0}^{3}$. The details of the behavior of these models are explicitly worked out in this paper.",1

72689,2,"A note on polarized light from Magnetars In a recent paper it is claimed that vacuum birefringence has been experimentally observed for the first time by measuring the degree of polarization of visible light from a magnetar candidate, a neutron star with a magnetic field presumably as large as $B\sim 10^{13}~\hbox {G}$ . The role of such a strong magnetic field is twofold. First, the surface of the star emits, at each point, polarized light with linear polarization correlated with the orientation of the magnetic field. Depending on the relative orientation of the magnetic axis of the star with the direction to the distant observer, a certain degree of polarization should be visible. Second, the strong magnetic field in the vacuum surrounding the star could enhance the effective degree of polarization observed: vacuum birefringence. We compare experimental data and theoretical expectations concluding that the conditions to support a claim of strong evidence of vacuum birefringence effects are not met.",1
72699,2,"Warm FIRE: Simulating Galaxy Formation with Resonant Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter We study the impact of a warm dark matter (WDM) cosmology on dwarf galaxy formation through a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of $M_{\rm halo} \approx10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$ dark matter halos as part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. A main focus of this paper is to evaluate the combined effects of dark matter physics and stellar feedback on the well-known small-scale issues found in cold dark matter (CDM) models. We find that the $z=0$ stellar mass of a galaxy is strongly correlated with the central density of its host dark matter halo at the time of formation, $z_{\rm f}$, in both CDM and WDM models. WDM halos follow the same $M_{\star}(z=0)-V_{\rm max}(z_{\rm f})$ relation as in CDM, but they form later, are less centrally dense, and therefore contain galaxies that are less massive than their CDM counterparts. As a result, the impact of baryonic effects on the central gravitational potential is typically diminished relative to CDM. However, the combination of delayed formation in WDM and energy input from stellar feedback results in dark matter profiles with lower overall densities. The WDM galaxies studied here have a wider diversity of star formation histories (SFHs) than the same systems simulated in CDM, and the two lowest $M_{\star}$ WDM galaxies form all of their stars at late times. The discovery of young ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with no ancient star formation -- which do not exist in our CDM simulations -- would therefore provide evidence in support of WDM.",1

However, hard X-ray emission ≳10 keV, which would be expected to primarily come from the jet or the accretion flow, had never been detected from its unresolved X-ray core. We report NuSTAR detection up to 40 keV from the the central regions of M87. Together with simultaneous Chandra observations, we have constrained the dominant hard X-ray emission to be from its unresolved X-ray core, presumably in its quiescent state. The core spectrum is well fitted by a power law with photon index ${\rm{\Gamma }}={2.11}_{-0.11}^{+0.15}$. The measured flux density at 40 keV is consistent with a jet origin, although emission from the advection-dominated accretion flow cannot be completely ruled out.

72748,2,"Reconstruction of the Dark Energy Equation of State from the Latest Observations Since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of our universe in 1998, studying the features of dark energy has remained a hot topic in modern cosmology. In the literature, dark energy is usually described by w ≡ P/ρ, where P and ρ denote its pressure and energy density. Therefore, exploring the evolution of w is the key approach to understanding dark energy. In this work, we adopt three different methods, polynomial expansion, principal component analysis, and the correlated prior method, to reconstruct w with a collection of the latest observations, including the type-Ia supernova, cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, Hubble measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and find that the concordance cosmological constant model (w = −1) is still safely consistent with these observational data at the 68% confidence level. However, when we add the high-redshift BAO measurement from the Lyα forest (Lyα FB) of BOSS DR11 quasars into the calculation, there is a significant impact on the reconstruction result. In the standard ΛCDM model, since the Lyα FB data slightly prefer a negative dark energy density, in order to avoid this problem, a dark energy model with a w significantly smaller than −1 is needed to explain this Lyα FB data. In this work, we find the consistent conclusion that there is a strong preference for the time-evolving behavior of dark energy w at high redshifts, when including the Lyα FB data. Therefore, we think that this Lyα FB data needs to be watched carefully attention when studying the evolution of the dark energy equation of state.",1
72771,2,"Superfluidity in nuclear systems and neutron stars Nuclear matter and finite nuclei exhibit the property of superfluidity by forming Cooper pairs due to the attractive component of the nuclear interaction. We review the microscopic theories and methods that are being employed to understand the basic properties of superfluid nuclear systems, with emphasis on the spacially extended ensembles encountered in neutron stars and in nuclear collisions. Our survey includes techniques which are based on Green functions, correlated basis functions, and Monte Carlo sampling of quantum states. Novel phases arise in nuclear and related systems (such as ultra-cold atomic gases) under imbalance in the populations of the fermions that form Cooper pairs. Such phases include current-carrying superfluid states, heterogeneous phase-separated states, and phases involving deformation of Fermi surfaces. The phase diagram of imbalanced superfluids is reviewed, focusing especially on the crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of tightly bound dimers under increase of the coupling strength of the theory. The neutron, proton, and hyperonic condensates that may exist under conditions prevailing in neutron stars are discussed, and calculations of weak-interaction rates within the Green functions formalism are examined in detail.

72775,2,"Merging of momentum-space monopoles by controlling Zeeman field: From cubic-Dirac to triple-Weyl fermion systems We analyze a generalized Dirac system, where the dispersion along the kx and ky axes is Nth power and linear along the kz axis. In the presence of the Zeeman field, there emerge N monopole-antimonopole pairs by controlling it beyond a certain critical one. As the direction of the Zeeman field is rotated toward the z axis, monopoles move to the north pole while antimonopoles move to the south pole. When the Zeeman field becomes parallel to the z axis, they merge into one monopole or one antimonopole whose monopole charge is ±N. The resultant system is a multiple-Weyl semimetal. Characteristic properties of such a system are that the anomalous Hall effect and the chiral anomaly are enhanced by N times and that N Fermi arcs appear. These phenomena will be observed experimentally in the cubic-Dirac and triple-Weyl fermion systems (N=3).",1
72790,2,"Single electron multiplication distribution in GEM avalanches In this paper, measurement results and experimental methodology are presented on the determination of multiplication distributions of avalanches initiated by single electron in GEM foils. The measurement relies on the amplification of photoelectrons by the GEM under study, which is subsequently amplified in an MWPC for signal enhancement and readout. The intrinsic detector resolution, namely the sigma-over-mean ratio of the multiplication distribution is also elaborated. Small gain dependence of the shape of the avalanche response distribution is observed in the range of net effective gain of 15 to 100. The distribution has an exponentially decaying tail at large amplitudes. At small amplitudes, the applied working gas is seen to have a well visible effect on the shape of the multiplication distribution. Equivalently, the working gas has an influence on the intrinsic detector resolution of GEMs via suppression of the low amplitude responses. A sigma-over-mean ratio of 0.75 was reached using a neon based mixture, whereas other gases provided an intrinsic detector resolution closer to 1, meaning a multiplication distribution closer to the low-field limit exponential case.",1

The nucleosynthesis in cataclysmic events such as in novae, X-ray bursters and in core-collapse supernovae, the role of neutrinos, and the supernova radioactivity and light-curve is further discussed, as well as the structure of neutron stars and its equation of state. A brief review of the element composition found in cosmic rays is made in the end.",1
72960,2,"Higher-order gravity and the classical equivalence principle As is well known, the deflection of any particle by a gravitational field within the context of Einstein’s general relativity — which is a geometrical theory — is, of course, nondispersive. Nevertheless, as we shall show in this paper, the mentioned result will change totally if the bending is analyzed — at the tree level — in the framework of higher-order gravity. Indeed, to first order, the deflection angle corresponding to the scattering of different quantum particles by the gravitational field mentioned above is not only spin dependent, it is also dispersive (energy-dependent). Consequently, it violates the classical equivalence principle (universality of free fall, or equality of inertial and gravitational masses) which is a nonlocal principle. However, contrary to popular belief, it is in agreement with the weak equivalence principle which is nothing but a statement about purely local effects. It is worthy of note that the weak equivalence principle encompasses the classical equivalence principle locally. We also show that the claim that there exists an incompatibility between quantum mechanics and the weak equivalence principle, is incorrect.",1

73026,2,"Zoomed cosmological simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes in f(R) gravity We investigate the impact of f(R) modified gravity on the internal properties of Milky Way-sized dark matter haloes in a set of cosmological zoom simulations of seven haloes from the Aquarius suite, carried out with our code mg-gadget in the Hu & Sawicki f(R) model. Also, we calculate the fifth forces in ideal NFW-haloes as well as in our cosmological simulations and compare them against analytic model predictions for the fifth force inside spherical objects. We find that these theoretical predictions match the forces in the ideal haloes very well, whereas their applicability is somewhat limited for realistic cosmological haloes. Our simulations show that f(R) gravity significantly affects the dark matter density profile of Milky Way-sized objects as well as their circular velocities. In unscreened regions, the velocity dispersions are increased by up to 40 per cent with respect to ΛCDM for viable f(R) models. This difference is larger than reported in previous works. The Solar circle is fully screened in $\skew6\bar{f}_{R0} = -10^{-6}$ models for Milky Way-sized haloes, while this location is unscreened for slightly less massive objects. Within the scope of our limited halo sample size, we do not find a clear dependence of the concentration parameter of dark matter haloes on $\skew6\bar{f}_{R0}$.",1
73062,2,"Universes without the Weak Force: Astrophysical Processes with Stable Neutrons We investigate a class of universes in which the weak interaction is not in operation. We consider how astrophysical processes are altered in the absence of weak forces, including big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), galaxy formation, molecular cloud assembly, star formation, and stellar evolution. Without weak interactions, neutrons no longer decay, and the universe emerges from its early epochs with a mixture of protons, neutrons, deuterium, and helium. The baryon-to-photon ratio must be smaller than the canonical value in our Universe to allow free nucleons to survive the BBN epoch without being incorporated into heavier nuclei. At later times, the free neutrons readily combine with protons to make deuterium in sufficiently dense parts of the interstellar medium, and provide a power source before they are incorporated into stars. Almost all of the neutrons are incorporated into deuterium nuclei before stars are formed. As a result, stellar evolution proceeds primarily through strong interactions, with deuterium first burning into helium, and then helium fusing into carbon. Low-mass deuterium-burning stars can be long-lived, and higher-mass stars can synthesize the heavier elements necessary for life. Although somewhat different from our own, such universes remain potentially habitable.",1
73086,2,"A signature of anisotropic cosmic-ray transport in the gamma-ray sky A crucial process in Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) transport is the spatial diffusion due to the interaction with the interstellar turbulent magnetic field. Usually, CR diffusion is assumed to be uniform and isotropic all across the Galaxy. However, this picture is clearly inaccurate: several data-driven and theoretical arguments, as well as dedicated numerical simulations, show that diffusion exhibits highly anisotropic properties with respect to the direction of a background (ordered) magnetic field (i.e., parallel or perpendicular to it). In this paper we focus on a recently discovered anomaly in the hadronic CR spectrum inferred by the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data at different positions in the Galaxy, i.e. the progressive hardening of the proton slope at low Galactocentric radii. We propose the idea that this feature can be interpreted as a signature of anisotropic diffusion in the complex Galactic magnetic field: in particular, the harder slope in the inner Galaxy is due, in our scenario, to the parallel diffusive escape along the poloidal component of the large-scale, regular, magnetic field. We implement this idea in a numerical framework, based on the DRAGON code, and perform detailed numerical tests on the accuracy of our setup. We discuss how the effect proposed depends on the relevant free parameters involved. Based on low-energy extrapolation of the few focused numerical simulations aimed at determining the scalings of the anisotropic diffusion coefficients, we finally present a set of plausible models that reproduce the behavior of the CR proton slopes inferred by gamma-ray data.",1

The approximate formulas for a moderately small eikonal are derived. In contrast to the standard eikonal integrals, they contain no Bessel functions, and, hence, no rapidly oscillating integrands. The formulas obtained are applied to numerical evaluations of the total cross section for a number of particular expressions for the eikonal. It is shown that for pure imaginary eikonals the relative error of O(10^(-5)) can be achieved. Also two improper triple integrals are analytically calculated.",1

73212,2,"Experimental evidence of radiation reaction in the collision of a high-intensity laser pulse with a laser-wakefield accelerated electron beam The dynamics of energetic particles in strong electromagnetic fields can be heavily influenced by the energy loss arising from the emission of radiation during acceleration, known as radiation reaction. When interacting with a high-energy electron beam, today’s lasers are sufficiently intense to explore the transition between the classical and quantum radiation reaction regimes. We present evidence of radiation reaction in the collision of an ultrarelativistic electron beam generated by laser-wakefield acceleration (ϵ>500  MeV) with an intense laser pulse (a0>10). We measure an energy loss in the postcollision electron spectrum that is correlated with the detected signal of hard photons (γ rays), consistent with a quantum description of radiation reaction. The generated γ rays have the highest energies yet reported from an all-optical inverse Compton scattering scheme, with critical energy ϵcrit>30  MeV.",1

This type of solution has horizons but does not present singularities. The first regular black hole was presented by Bardeen and can be obtained from Einstein equations in the presence of an electromagnetic field. E. Ayon-Beato and A. Garcia reinterpreted the Bardeen metric as a magnetic solution of General Relativity coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. In this work show that the Bardeen model may also be interpreted as a solutions of Einstein equations in the presence of a electric source, whose electric field does not behaves as a Coulomb field. We analyzed the asymptotic forms of the Lagrangian for the electric case and also analyzed the energy conditions.",1
73243,2,"Progress on the PITZ TDS A transverse deflecting system (TDS) is under commissioning at the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ). The structure was designed and manufactured by the Institute for Nuclear Research (INR RAS, Moscow, Russia) as prototype for the TDS in the injector part of the European XFEL. Last year the deflection voltage was limited for safety reasons, but after thorough investigations of the waveguide system we are now able to operate the cavity close to design specifications. The PITZ TDS streaks the electron beam vertically, allowing measurements of the longitudinal bunch profile, and, in combination with a subsequent horizontal bending magnet, also of the longitudinal phase space and slice energy spread. Furthermore, several quadrupole magnets and screen stations can be employed for slice emittance measurements using the TDS. This paper describes the progress in commissioning of the hardware, measurement techniques and simulations, and outlines the prospects of reliable slice emittance measurements at 20 MeV/c, where space charge forces complicate the determination of transfer matrices.",1

These simulations have been performed at multiple resolutions and with two independent techniques to solve Einstein’s equations. For the nonprecessing and precessing simulations, we demonstrate the two techniques agree mode by mode, at a precision substantially in excess of statistical uncertainties in current LIGO’s observations. Conversely, we demonstrate our full numerical solutions contain information which is not accurately captured with the approximate phenomenological models commonly used to infer compact binary parameters. To quantify the impact of these differences on parameter inference for GW170104 specifically, we compare the predictions of our simulations and these approximate models to LIGO’s observations of GW170104.",1

Our analysis is motivated by the constant-negative-spatial-curvature form of the AdS black hole metric.",1
73639,2,"Experimental studies of 7-cell dual axis asymmetric cavity for energy recovery linac High average current, transportable energy recovery linacs (ERLs) can be very attractive tools for a number of applications including next generation high-luminosity, compact light sources. Conventional ERLs are based on an electron beam circulating through the same set of rf cavity cells. This leads to an accumulation of high-order modes inside the cavity cells, resulting in the development of a beam breakup (BBU) instability, unless the beam current is kept below the BBU start current. This limits the maximum current which can be transported through the ERL and hence the intensity of the photon beam generated. It has recently been proposed that splitting the accelerating and decelerating stages, tuning them separately and coupling them via a resonance coupler can increase the BBU start current. The paper presents the first experimental rf studies of a dual axis 7-cell asymmetric cavity and confirms the properties predicted by the theoretical model. The field structures of the symmetric and asymmetric modes are measured and good agreement with the numerical predictions is demonstrated. The operating mode field flatness was also measured and discussed. A novel approach based on the coupled mode (Fano-like) model has been developed for the description of the cavity eigenmode spectrum and good agreement between analytical theory, numerical predictions and experimental data is shown. Numerical and experimental results observed are analyzed, discussed and a good agreement between theory and experiment is demonstrated.",1
73650,2,"Constraints on the nuclear equation of state from nuclear masses and radii in a Thomas-Fermi meta-modeling approach The question of correlations among empirical equation of state (EoS) parameters constrained by nuclear observables is addressed in a Thomas-Fermi meta-modeling approach. A recently proposed meta-modeling for the nuclear EoS in nuclear matter is augmented with a single finite size term to produce a minimal unified EoS functional able to describe the smooth part of the nuclear ground state properties. This meta-model can reproduce the predictions of a large variety of models, and interpolate continuously between them. An analytical approximation to the full Thomas-Fermi integrals is further proposed giving a fully analytical meta-model for nuclear masses. The parameter space is sampled and filtered through the constraint of nuclear mass reproduction with Bayesian statistical tools. We show that this simple analytical meta-modeling has a predictive power on masses, radii, and skins comparable to full Hartree-Fock or extended Thomas-Fermi calculations with realistic energy functionals. The covariance analysis on the posterior distribution shows that no physical correlation is present between the different EoS parameters. Concerning nuclear observables, a strong correlation between the slope of the symmetry energy and the neutron skin is observed, in agreement with previous studies.",1

Assessed in this paper is the role which the mechanism might play in a potential departure from the isospin symmetry in the two $\pi^\pm p$ elastic-scattering reactions.,1
73697,2,"General Relativity, Time and Determinism Einstein's theory of general relativity models the physical universe using spacetimes which satisfy Einstein's gravitational field equations. To date, Einstein's theory has been enormously successful in modeling observed gravitational phenomena, both at the astrophysical and the cosmological levels. The collection of spacetime solutions of Einstein's equations which have been effectively used for modeling the physical universe is a very small subset of the full set of solutions. Among this larger set, there are many spacetimes in which strange phenomena related to time are present: There are solutions containing regions in which determinism and the predictability of experimental outcomes breaks down (the Taub-NUT spacetimes), and there others in which the breakdown of determinism occurs everywhere (the G\""odel universe). Should the existence of these strange solutions lead us to question the usefulness of Einstein's theory in modeling physical phenomena? Should it instead lead us to seriously search for strange time phenomena in physics? Or should we simply treat these solutions as anomalous (if embarrassing) distractions which we can ignore? In this essay, after introducing some basic ideas of special and general relativity and discussing what it means for a spacetime to be a solution of Einstein's equations, we explore the use of spacetime solutions for modeling astrophysical events and cosmology. We then examine some of the spacetime solutions in which determinism and causal relationships break down, we relate such phenomena to Penrose's ""Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture"", and finally we discuss the questions noted above.",1

Mainly, they were discovered in the 1980s. Their major property is an explicit knowledge of several eigenstates while the remaining ones are unknown. Many of these problems are of the anharmonic oscillator type with a special type of anharmonicity. The Hamiltonians of quasi-exactly-solvable problems are characterized by the existence of a hidden algebraic structure but do not have any hidden symmetry properties.

It is known that complex nonhermitian hamiltonians which are PT-symmetric (= invariant under simultaneous parity P and time reversal T transformations) can have real eigenvalues. The hamiltonian ℋ$_{1}$ is PT-symmetric for h, x ∈ ℝ. It is found that ℋ$_{1}$ has a real spectrum in the weak coupling region for ν ∈ ℝ\ℤ. This fact in an elementary way follows from a definition of the N$_{f}$ = 1 classical irregular block. Thus, ℋ$_{1}$ can serve as yet another new model for testing postulates of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics.",1
73839,2,"Simulation of nonlinear superconducting rf losses derived from characteristic topography of etched and electropolished niobium surfaces A simplified numerical model has been developed to simulate nonlinear superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) losses on Nb surfaces. This study focuses exclusively on excessive surface resistance (Rs) losses due to the microscopic topographical magnetic field enhancements. When the enhanced local surface magnetic field exceeds the superconducting critical transition magnetic field Hc, small volumes of surface material may become normal conducting and increase the effective surface resistance without inducing a quench. We seek to build an improved quantitative characterization of this qualitative model. Using topographic data from typical buffered chemical polish (BCP)- and electropolish (EP)-treated fine grain niobium, we have estimated the resulting field-dependent losses and extrapolated this model to the implications for cavity performance. The model predictions correspond well to the characteristic BCP versus EP high field Q0 performance differences for fine grain niobium. We describe the algorithm of the model, its limitations, and the effects of this nonlinear loss contribution on SRF cavity performance.",1

Numerous relations between the realistic conditions are found and the need for a graphic proof is reduced just to one pair of inequalities.

However, these spacetimes necessarily require imperfect fluids with entropy flux. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the existence of these spacetimes in generic f(R)-gravity models, where the entropy flux is generated purely by higher order curvature effects, while the standard matter still remains a perfect fluid. However, we transparently demonstrate here, that the symmetries of these spacetimes force the theory to be general relativity.

74125,2,"Relativistic Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei and Microquasars Collimated outflows (jets) appear to be a ubiquitous phenomenon associated with the accretion of material onto a compact object. Despite this ubiquity, many fundamental physics aspects of jets are still poorly understood and constrained. These include the mechanism of launching and accelerating jets, the connection between these processes and the nature of the accretion flow, and the role of magnetic fields, the physics responsible for the collimation of jets over tens of thousands to even millions of gravitational radii of the central accreting object, the matter content of jets, the location of the region(s) accelerating particles to TeV (possibly even PeV and EeV) energies (as evidenced by $\gamma$ -ray emission observed from many jet sources) and the physical processes responsible for this particle acceleration, the radiative processes giving rise to the observed multi-wavelength emission, and the topology of magnetic fields and their role in the jet collimation and particle acceleration processes. This chapter reviews the main knowns and unknowns in our current understanding of relativistic jets, in the context of the main model ingredients for Galactic and extragalactic jet sources. It discusses aspects specific to active Galactic nuclei (especially blazars) and microquasars, and then presents a comparative discussion of similarities and differences between them.",1
74144,2,"Gravitational closure of matter field equations The requirement that both the matter and the geometry of a spacetime canonically evolve together, starting and ending on shared Cauchy surfaces and independently of the intermediate foliation, leaves one with little choice for diffeomorphism-invariant gravitational dynamics that can equip the coefficients of a given system of matter field equations with causally compatible canonical dynamics. Concretely, we show how starting from any linear local matter field equations whose principal polynomial satisfies three physicality conditions, one may calculate coefficient functions which then enter an otherwise immutable set of countably many linear homogeneous partial differential equations. Any solution of these so-called gravitational closure equations then provides a Lagrangian density for any type of tensorial geometry that features ultralocally in the initially specified matter Lagrangian density. Thus the given system of matter field equations is indeed closed by the so obtained gravitational equations. In contrast to previous work, we build the theory on a suitable associated bundle encoding the canonical configuration degrees of freedom, which allows one to include necessary constraints on the geometry in practically tractable fashion. By virtue of the presented mechanism, one thus can practically calculate, rather than having to postulate, the gravitational theory that is required by specific matter field dynamics. For the special case of standard model matter one obtains general relativity.",1

When a uniaxial strain is applied to graphene, the Dirac cone is made elliptical on the equal-energy plane, and the fermion velocity becomes anisotropic. The applied uniaxial strain has two effects: It decreases the mean value of fermion velocity; it increases the velocity anisotropy. After solving the Dyson-Schwinger gap equation, we show that dynamical gap generation is promoted by the former effect but suppressed by the latter. For suspended graphene, we find that the system undergoes an excitonic insulating transition when the strain is roughly 7.34%. We also solve the gap equation in case the Dirac cone is tilted, which might be realized in the organic material α-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 and find that the tilt of the Dirac cone can suppress dynamical gap generation. It turns out that the geometry of the Dirac cone plays an important role in the formation of excitonic pairing.",1

74567,2,"Relativistic Energy Analysis of Five-Dimensional q-Deformed Radial Rosen-Morse Potential Combined with q-Deformed Trigonometric Scarf Noncentral Potential Using Asymptotic Iteration Method We study the exact solution of Dirac equation in the hyperspherical coordinate under influence of separable -deformed quantum potentials. The -deformed hyperbolic Rosen-Morse potential is perturbed by -deformed noncentral trigonometric Scarf potentials, where all of them can be solved by using Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM). This work is limited to spin symmetry case. The relativistic energy equation and orbital quantum number equation have been obtained using Asymptotic Iteration Method. The upper radial wave function equations and angular wave function equations are also obtained by using this method. The relativistic energy levels are numerically calculated using Matlab, and the increase of radial quantum number causes the increase of bound state relativistic energy level in both dimensions and . The bound state relativistic energy level decreases with increasing of both deformation parameter and orbital quantum number .",1
74577,2,"R-matrix-valued Lax pairs and long-range spin chains In this paper we discuss R -matrix-valued Lax pairs for slN Calogero–Moser model and their relation to integrable quantum long-range spin chains of the Haldane–Shastry–Inozemtsev type. First, we construct the R -matrix-valued Lax pairs for the third flow of the classical Calogero–Moser model. Then we notice that the scalar parts (in the auxiliary space) of the M -matrices corresponding to the second and third flows have form of special spin exchange operators. The freezing trick restricts them to quantum Hamiltonians of long-range spin chains. We show that for a special choice of the R -matrix these Hamiltonians reproduce those for the Inozemtsev chain. In the general case related to the Baxter's elliptic R -matrix we obtain a natural anisotropic extension of the Inozemtsev chain. Commutativity of the Hamiltonians is verified numerically. Trigonometric limits lead to the Haldane–Shastry chains and their anisotropic generalizations.",1

The high number of Solar System objects observed and the variety of their orbital parameters associated with the impressive astrometric accuracy will allow us to perform local tests of General Relativity. In this communication, we present a preliminary sensitivity study of the Gaia observations on dynamical parameters such as the Sun quadrupolar moment and on various extensions to general relativity such as the parametrized post-Newtonian parameters, the fifth force formalism and a violation of Lorentz symmetry parametrized by the Standard-Model extension framework. We take into account the time sequences and the geometry of the observations that are particular to Gaia for its nominal mission (5 years) and for an extended mission (10 years).",1
74595,2,"Distance-dependent sign-reversal in the Casimir-Lifshitz torque The Casimir-Lifshitz torque between two biaxially polarizable anisotropic planar slabs is shown to exhibit a nontrivial sign reversal in its rotational sense. The critical distance ac between the slabs that marks this reversal is characterized by the frequency ωc∼c/2ac at which the in-planar polarizabilities along the two principal axes are equal. The two materials seek to align their principal axes of polarizabilities in one direction below ac, while above ac their axes try to align rotated perpendicular relative to their previous minimum energy orientation. The sign reversal disappears in the nonretarded limit. Our perturbative result, derived for the case when the differences in the relative polarizabilities are small, matches excellently with the exact theory for uniaxial materials. We illustrate our results for black phosphorus and phosphorene.",1

74654,2,"Modifications to JLab 12 GeV Refrigerator and Wide Range Mix Mode Performance Testing Results Analysis of data obtained during the spring 2013 commissioning of the new 4.5 K refrigeration system at Jefferson Lab (JLab) for the 12 GeV upgrade indicated a wide capacity range with good efficiency and minimal operator interaction. Testing also showed that the refrigerator required higher liquid nitrogen (LN) consumption for its pre-cooler than anticipated by the design. This does not affect the capacity of the refrigerator, but it does result in an increased LN utility cost. During the summer of 2015 the modifications were implemented by the cold box manufacturer, according to a design similar to the JLab 12 GeV cold box specification. Subsequently, JLab recommissioned the cold box and performed extensive performance testing, ranging from 20% to 100% of the design maximum capacity, and in various modes of operation, ranging from pure refrigeration, pure liquefaction, half-and-half mix mode and at selected design modes using the Floating Pressure – Ganni Cycle. The testing demonstrated that the refrigerator system has a good and fairly constant performance over a wide capacity range and different modes of operation. It also demonstrated the modifications resulted in a LN consumption that met the design for the pure refrigeration mode (which is the most demanding) and was lower than the design for the nominal and maximum capacity modes. In addition, a pulsed-load test, similar to what is expected for cryogenic systems supporting fusion experiments, was conducted to observe the response using the Floating Pressure – Ganni Cycle, which was stable and robust. This paper will discuss the results and analysis of this testing pertaining to the LN consumption, the system efficiency over a wide range of capacity and different modes and the behaviour of the system to a pulsed load.",1

74916,2,"Quenching of $g_{\rm A}$ deduced from the $\beta$-spectrum shape of $^{113}$Cd measured with the COBRA experiment A first dedicated measurement of the quenching of the weak axial-vector coupling strength $g_{\rm A}$ was performed by the COBRA collaboration. The $\beta$-electron spectrum shape of the fourfold forbidden non-unique decay of $^{113}$Cd strongly depends on the effective value of $g_{\rm A}$. Using an array of CdZnTe semiconductor detectors, 45 independent spectra were obtained and interpreted in the context of three different nuclear models. The resulting effective mean values are $\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{ISM}) = 0.915 \pm 0.021$, $\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{MQPM}) = 0.911 \pm 0.009$ and $\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{IBFM-2}) = 0.943 \pm 0.090$.

74944,2,"Superconducting proximity in three-dimensional Dirac materials: Odd-frequency, pseudoscalar, pseudovector, and tensor-valued superconducting orders We find that a conventional s-wave superconductor in proximity to a three-dimensional Dirac material (3DDM), to all orders of perturbation in tunneling, induces a combination of s- and p-wave pairing only. We show that the Lorentz invariance of the superconducting pairing prevents the formation of Cooper pairs with higher orbital angular momenta in the 3DDM. This no-go theorem acquires stronger form when the probability of tunneling from the conventional superconductor to positive and negative energy states of 3DDM are equal. In this case, all the p-wave contribution except for the lowest order, identically vanish and hence we obtain an exact result for the induced p-wave superconductivity in 3DDM. Fierz decomposing the superconducting matrix we find that the temporal component of the vector superconducting order and the spatial components of the pseudovector order have odd-frequency pairing symmetry. We find that the latter is odd with respect to exchange of position and chirality of the electrons in the Cooper pair and is a spin-triplet, which is necessary for NMR detection of such an exotic pseudovector pairing. Moreover, we show that the tensorial order breaks into a polar vector and an axial vector and both of them have conventional pairing symmetry except for being a spin triplet. According to our study, for gapless 3DDM, the tensorial superconducting order will be the only order that is odd with respect to the chemical potential μ. Therefore we predict that a transverse p-n junction binds Majorana fermions. This effect can be used to control the neutral Majorana fermions with electric fields.",1
75005,2,"Reionization in Technicolor We present the Technicolor Dawn simulations, a suite of cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the first 1.2 billion years. By modeling a spatially-inhomogeneous UVB on-the-fly with 24 frequencies and resolving dark matter halos down to $10^8 M_\odot$ within 12 $h^{-1}$ Mpc volumes, our simulations unify observations of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media, galaxies, and reionization into a common framework. The only empirically-tuned parameter, the fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,gal}}(z)$ of ionizing photons that escape the interstellar medium, is adjusted to match observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and the cosmic microwave background. With this single calibration, our simulations reproduce the history of reionization; the stellar mass-star formation rate relation of galaxies; the number density and metallicity of damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z\sim5$; the abundance of weak metal absorbers; the ultraviolet background (UVB) amplitude; and the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum at $z=5.4$. The galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions are underproduced by $\leq2\times$, suggesting an overly vigorous feedback model. The mean transmission in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest is underproduced at $z<6$, indicating tension between measurements of the UVB amplitude and Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission. The observed SiIV column density distribution is reasonably well-reproduced ($\sim 1\sigma$ low). By contrast, CIV remains significantly underproduced despite being boosted by an intense $>4$ Ryd UVB. Solving this problem by increasing metal yields would overproduce both weak absorbers and DLA metallicities. Instead, the observed strength of high-ionization emission from high-redshift galaxies and absorption from their environments suggest that the ionizing flux from conventional stellar population models is too soft.",1
75022,2,"Ladder operators for the Klein-Gordon equation with a scalar curvature term Recently, Cardoso, Houri and Kimura constructed generalized ladder operators for massive Klein-Gordon scalar fields in space-times with conformal symmetry. Their construction requires a closed conformal Killing vector, which is also an eigenvector of the Ricci tensor. Here, a similar procedure is used to construct generalized ladder operators for the Klein-Gordon equation with a scalar curvature term. It is proven that a ladder operator requires the existence of a conformal Killing vector, which must satisfy an additional property. This property is necessary and sufficient for the construction of a ladder operator. For maximally symmetric space-times, the results are equivalent to those of Cardoso, Houri and Kimura.",1
75093,2,"Results from the Project 8 phase-1 cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy detector The Project 8 collaboration seeks to measure the absolute neutrino mass scale by means of precision spectroscopy of the beta decay of tritium. Our technique, cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, measures the frequency of the radiation emitted by electrons produced by decays in an ambient magnetic field. Because the cyclotron frequency is inversely proportional to the electron’s Lorentz factor, this is also a measurement of the electron’s energy. In order to demonstrate the viability of this technique, we have assembled and successfully operated a prototype system, which uses a rectangular waveguide to collect the cyclotron radiation from internal conversion electrons emitted from a gaseous (83)m( )Kr source. Here we present the main design aspects of the first phase prototype, which was operated during parts of 2014 and 2015.

75138,2,"de Sitter-invariant special relativity and the dark energy problem The replacement of the Poincaré-invariant Einstein special relativity by a de Sitter-invariant special relativity produces concomitant changes in all relativistic theories, including general relativity. A crucial change in the latter is that both the background de Sitter curvature and the gravitational dynamical curvature turns out to be included in a single curvature tensor. This means that the cosmological term $\Lambda$ no longer explicitly appears in Einstein equation, and is consequently not restricted to be constant. In this paper, the Newtonian limit of such theory is obtained, and the ensuing Newtonian Friedmann equations are shown to provide a good account of the dark energy content of the present-day universe.",1

75261,2,"Deformed Fredkin Spin Chain with Extensive Entanglement We introduce a new spin chain which is a deformation of the Fredkin spin chain and has a phase transition between bounded and extensive entanglement entropy scaling. In this chain, spins have a local interaction of three nearest neighbors. The Hamiltonian is frustration-free and its ground state can be described analytically as a weighted superposition of Dyck paths that depends on a deformation parameter t. In the purely spin 1/2 case, whenever $t\neq1$ , the entanglement entropy obeys an area law: it is bounded from above by a constant, when the size of the block n increases. When a local color degree of freedom is introduced and t  >  1 the entanglement entropy increases linearly, while for t  <  1 an area law is obeyed. The half-chain entanglement entropy is tightly bounded by ${n}\log s$ where 2n is the length of the chain, and s is the number of colors. Our chain fosters a new example for a significant boost to entropy and for the existence of the associated critical rainbow phase where the entanglement entropy scales with volume that discovered by Zhang, Ahmadain and Klich (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci 2017).",1

However, some popular models of dark energy (DE) give the maximum deviation from ΛCDM at z > 2 therefore we investigated sensitivity of hypothetical high redshift surveys to the model of DE.

75325,2,"Equation of State in the Presence of Gravity We investigate how an equation of state for matter is affected when a gravity is present. For this purpose, we consider a box of ideal gas in the presence of Newtonian gravity. In addition to the ordinary thermodynamic quantities, a characteristic variable that represents a weight per unit area relative to the average pressure is required in order to describe a macroscopic state of the gas. Although the density and the pressure are not uniform due to the presence of gravity, the ideal gas law itself is satisfied for the thermodynamic quantities when averaged over the system. Assuming that the system follows an adiabatic process further, we obtain a new relation between the averaged pressure and density, which differs from the conventional equation of state for the ideal gas in the absence of gravity. Applying our results to a small volume in a Newtonian star, however, we find that the conventional one is reliable for most astrophysical situations when the characteristic scale is small. On the other hand, gravity effects become significant near the surface of a Newtonian star.",1

75372,2,"Systematic construction of spin liquids on the square lattice from tensor networks with SU(2) symmetry We elaborate a simple classification scheme of all rank-5 SU(2) spin rotational symmetric tensors according to (i) the onsite physical spin S, (ii) the local Hilbert space V⊗4 of the four virtual (composite) spins attached to each site, and (iii) the irreducible representations of the C4v point group of the square lattice. We apply our scheme to draw a complete list of all SU(2)-symmetric translationally and rotationally invariant projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with bond dimension D≤6. All known SU(2)-symmetric PEPS on the square lattice are recovered and simple generalizations are provided in some cases. More generally, to each of our symmetry class can be associated a (D−1)-dimensional manifold of spin liquids (potentially) preserving lattice symmetries and defined in terms of D-independent tensors of a given bond dimension D. In addition, generic (low-dimensional) families of PEPS explicitly breaking either (i) particular point-group lattice symmetries (lattice nematics) or (ii) time-reversal symmetry (chiral spin liquids) or (iii) SU(2) spin rotation symmetry down to U(1) (spin nematics or Néel antiferromagnets) can also be constructed. We apply this framework to search for new topological chiral spin liquids characterized by well-defined chiral edge modes, as revealed by their entanglement spectrum. In particular, we show how the symmetrization of a double-layer PEPS leads to a chiral topological state with a gapless edge described by a SU(2)2 Wess-Zumino-Witten model.",1

The theoretical predictions on the $\alpha $ decay half-lives of normal Po isotopes are compared with experimental results and are seen to be matching well with each other. The neutron shell closure at $N = 126$ is found to be the same for both normal and hypernuclei. The Geiger–Nuttal (G–N) law for $\alpha $ decay is unaltered in the case of hypernuclei. The hypernuclei will decay into normal nuclei by mesonic or non-mesonic decay modes.

Anisotropic primordial non-Gaussianity induces a distinct scale-dependent imprint in these tidal alignments on large scales. Motivated by the observational finding that the alignment strength of luminous red galaxies depends on how galaxy shapes are measured, we study the use of two different shape estimators as a multitracer probe of intrinsic alignments. We show, by means of a Fisher analysis, that this technique promises a significant improvement on anisotropic non-Gaussianity constraints over a single-tracer method. For future weak lensing surveys, the uncertainty in the anisotropic non-Gaussianity parameter, A2, is forecast to be σ(A2)≈50, ∼40% smaller than currently available constraints from the bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background. This corresponds to an improvement of a factor of 4–5 over the uncertainty from a single-tracer analysis.",1

75858,2,"Affine Sphere Relativity We investigate spacetimes whose light cones could be anisotropic. We prove the equivalence of the structures: (a) Lorentz–Finsler manifold for which the mean Cartan torsion vanishes, (b) Lorentz–Finsler manifold for which the indicatrix (observer space) at each point is a convex hyperbolic affine sphere centered on the zero section, and (c) pair given by a spacetime volume and a sharp convex cone distribution. The equivalence suggests to describe (affine sphere) spacetimes with this structure, so that no algebraic-metrical concept enters the definition. As a result, this work shows how the metric features of spacetime emerge from elementary concepts such as measure and order. Non-relativistic spacetimes are obtained replacing proper spheres with improper spheres, so the distinction does not call for group theoretical elements. In physical terms, in affine sphere spacetimes the light cone distribution and the spacetime measure determine the motion of massive and massless particles (hence the dispersion relation). Furthermore, it is shown that, more generally, for Lorentz–Finsler theories non-differentiable at the cone, the lightlike geodesics and the transport of the particle momentum over them are well defined, though the curve parametrization could be undefined. Causality theory is also well behaved. Several results for affine sphere spacetimes are presented.

L_p=\sqrt{(\frac {2\hbar G}{c^3})}$ has one unit of the Planck-mass $M_p=\sqrt
{(\frac {c\hbar}{2G})}$. Subsequent spherical shells of radial width $L_p$
contain exactly one unit of $M_p$. We study this stellar configuration using
Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and show that the equation is satisfied if
pressure $P(r)=-\rho(r)$. On the geometrical side, the space component of the
metric blows up at every point. The time component of the metric is zero inside
the star but only in the sense of a distribution (generalized function). The
Planckonions with such a maximally packed density profile mimic the black holes
but avoid appearance of central singularity because of the violation of null
energy conditions.",1

76594,2,Nonlinear anisotropy growth in Bianchi-I spacetime in metric $f(R)$ cosmology The present work is related to anisotropic cosmological evolution in metric $f(R)$ theory of gravity. The initial part of the paper develops the general cosmological dynamics of homogeneous anisotropic Bianchi-I spacetime in $f(R)$ cosmology. The anisotropic spacetime is pervaded by a barotropic fluid which has isotropic pressure. The paper predicts nonlinear growth of anisotropy in such spacetimes. In the later part of the paper we display the predictive power of the nonlinear differential equation responsible for the cosmological anisotropy growth in various relevant cases. We present the exact solutions of anisotropy growth in Starobinsky inflation driven by quadratic gravity and exponential gravity theory. Semi-analytical results are presented for the contraction phase in quadratic gravity bounce. The various examples of anisotropy growth in Bianchi-I model universe shows the complex nature of the problem at hand.,1

Following Ruijsenaars’ ideas on the translation invariant models, the proposed action-angle variables come from a thorough analysis of the commutation relation obeyed by the Lax matrix, whereas the proof of their canonicity is based on the study of the scattering theory. As a consequence, we show that the van Diejen system of our interest is self-dual with a factorized scattering map. Also, in an appendix by S.

76635,2,"Kitaev honeycomb tensor networks: exact unitary circuits and applications The Kitaev honeycomb model is a paradigm of exactly solvable models, showing nontrivial physical properties such as topological quantum order, Abelian and non-Abelian anyons, and chirality. Its solution is one of the most beautiful examples of the interplay of different mathematical techniques in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we show how to derive a tensor network (TN) description of the eigenstates of this spin-1/2 model in the thermodynamic limit, and in particular for its ground state. In our setting, eigenstates are naturally encoded by an exact 3d TN structure made of fermionic unitary operators, corresponding to the unitary quantum circuit building up the many-body quantum state. In our derivation we review how the different “solution ingredients” of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be accounted for in the TN language, namely, Jordan-Wigner transformation, braidings of Majorana modes, fermionic Fourier transformation, and Bogoliubov transformation. The TN built in this way allows for a clear understanding of several properties of the model. In particular, we show how the fidelity diagram is straightforward both at zero temperature and at finite temperature in the vortex-free sector. We also show how the properties of two-point correlation functions follow easily. Finally, we also discuss the pros and cons of contracting of our 3d TN down to a 2d projected entangled pair state (PEPS) with finite bond dimension. The results in this paper can be extended to generalizations of the Kitaev model, e.g., to other lattices, spins, and dimensions.",1

Lett. 71, 1291 (1993)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.71.1291], Page proved that the average entanglement entropy of subsystems of random pure states is Save≃lnDA-(1/2)DA2/D for 1≪DA≤D, where DA and D are the Hilbert space dimensions of the subsystem and the system, respectively. Hence, typical pure states are (nearly) maximally entangled. We develop tools to compute the average entanglement entropy ⟨S⟩ of all eigenstates of quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians. In particular, we derive exact bounds for the most general translationally invariant models lnDA-(lnDA)2/lnD≤⟨S⟩≤lnDA-[1/(2ln2)](lnDA)2/lnD. Consequently, we prove that (i) if the subsystem size is a finite fraction of the system size, then ⟨S⟩<lnDA in the thermodynamic limit; i.e., the average over eigenstates of the Hamiltonian departs from the result for typical pure states, and (ii) in the limit in which the subsystem size is a vanishing fraction of the system size, the average entanglement entropy is maximal; i.e., typical eigenstates of such Hamiltonians exhibit eigenstate thermalization.",1

76668,2,"Coupled Wire Model of $Z_4$ Orbifold Quantum Hall States We introduce a coupled wire model for a sequence of non-Abelian quantum Hall states that generalize the Z4 parafermion Read Rezayi state. The Z4 orbifold quantum Hall states occur at filling factors \nu = 2/(2m-p) for odd integers $m$ and $p$, and have a topological order with a neutral sector characterized by the orbifold conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$ at radius $R=\sqrt{p/2}$. When $p=1$ the state is Abelian. The state with $p=3$ is the $Z_4$ Read Rezayi state, and the series of $p\ge 3$ defines a sequence of non-Abelian states that resembles the Laughlin sequence. Our model is based on clustering of electrons in groups of four, and is formulated as a two fluid model in which each wire exhibits two phases: a weak clustered phase, where charge $e$ electrons coexist with charge $4e$ bosons and a strong clustered phase where the electrons are strongly bound in groups of 4. The transition between these two phases on a wire is mapped to the critical point of the 4 state clock model, which in turn is described by the orbifold conformal field theory. For an array of wires coupled in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, strongly clustered wires form a charge $4e$ bosonic Laughlin state with a chiral charge mode at the edge, but no neutral mode and a gap for single electrons. Coupled wires near the critical state form quantum Hall states with a gapless neutral mode described by the orbifold theory. The coupled wire approach allows us to employ the Abelian bosonization technique to fully analyze the physics of single wire, and then to extract most topological properties of the resulting non-Abelian quantum Hall states. These include the list of quasiparticles, their fusion rules, the correspondence between bulk quasiparticles and edge topological sectors, and most of the phases associated with quasiparticles winding one another.",1

Astrophysical implications We obtain the pressures and equations of state (EoS) of charged and neutral vector boson gases in a constant magnetic field. The axial symmetry imposed to the system by the field splits the pressures in the parallel and perpendicular directions along the magnetic axis, and this leads to anisotropic equations of state. The values of pressures and energy densities are in the order of those of Fermi gases in compact objects. This opens the possibility to the existence of magnetized boson stars. Under certain conditions, the perpendicular pressure might be negative imposing a bound to the stability of the star. Other implications of negative pressures are also discussed.",1

77042,2,"Parcels of Universe or why Schrödinger and Fourier are so relatives? This lecture is about the surprising connection between the Fourier heat equation and the Schr\""odinger wave equation. In fact, if the independent ""time"" variable in the heat equation is replaced by the time variable multiplied by $i=\sqrt{-1}$, the heat equation becomes the Schr\""odinger equation. Two quite different physical phenomena are put in close connection: the heat diffusion in a material and the probability amplitude of particles in an atom. It is a fact of life that the movements of a small particle floating randomly in a fluid, the well-known Brownian motion, is regulated by the Fourier equation while the probabilistic behavior of the matter around us, the quantum world, is driven by the Schr\""odinger equation but no known stochastic process seems at work here. The apparent simplicity of the formal connection by a ""time-rotation"", a Wick rotation as it is commonly known, seems to point otherwise. Why this connection? Is there any physical intuitive explanation? Is there any practical value? In this paper, the authors try to shed some light on the above questions. The recent concept of volume quantization in noncommutative geometry, due to Connes, Chamseddine and Mukhanov, points again to stochastic processes also underlying the quantum world making Fourier and Schr\""odinger strict relatives.",1

With the LAT data we show that this source is analogous to typical flat spectrum radio quasars in the L ( )γ( )–Γ( )γ( ) plane, where L ( )γ( ) and Γ( )γ( ) are the luminosity and spectral index in the LAT energy band. The γ-ray flux is correlated with the V-band flux with a lag of ∼44 days, and a moderate quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a periodicity of ∼490 days observed in the LAT light curve. A similar QPO signature is also found in the V-band light curve. The γ-ray flux is not correlated with the radio flux in 15 GHz, and no similar QPO signature is found at a confidence level of 95%.

We forecast how well different configurations of a CMB Stage-4 experiment can constrain cosmological parameters, in particular, the amplitude of structure as a function of redshift σ8(z), the sum of neutrino masses Σmν, and the dark energy equation of state w(z). A key element of this effort is calibrating the tSZ scaling relation by measuring the lensing signal around clusters. We examine how the mass calibration from future optical surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) compares with a purely internal calibration using lensing of the CMB itself. We find that, due to its high-redshift leverage, internal calibration gives constraints on cosmological parameters comparable to the optical calibration, and can be used as a cross-check of systematics in the optical measurement. We also show that in contrast to the constraints using the CMB lensing power spectrum, lensing-calibrated tSZ cluster counts can detect a minimal Σmν at the 3–5σ level even when the dark energy equation of state is freed up.",1

77597,2,"Accuracy of binary black hole waveform models for aligned-spin binaries Coalescing binary black holes are among the primary science targets for second generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Reliable gravitational waveform models are central to detection of such systems and subsequent parameter estimation. This paper performs a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of recent waveform models for binary black holes with aligned spins, utilizing a new set of 84 high-accuracy numerical relativity simulations. Our analysis covers comparable mass binaries (mass-ratio 1≤q≤3), and samples independently both black hole spins up to a dimensionless spin magnitude of 0.9 for equal-mass binaries and 0.85 for unequal mass binaries. Furthermore, we focus on the high-mass regime (total mass ≳50M⊙). The two most recent waveform models considered (PhenomD and SEOBNRv2) both perform very well for signal detection, losing less than 0.5% of the recoverable signal-to-noise ratio ρ, except that SEOBNRv2’s efficiency drops slightly for both black hole spins aligned at large magnitude. For parameter estimation, modeling inaccuracies of the SEOBNRv2 model are found to be smaller than systematic uncertainties for moderately strong GW events up to roughly ρ≲15. PhenomD’s modeling errors are found to be smaller than SEOBNRv2’s, and are generally irrelevant for ρ≲20. Both models’ accuracy deteriorates with increased mass ratio, and when at least one black hole spin is large and aligned. The SEOBNRv2 model shows a pronounced disagreement with the numerical relativity simulation in the merger phase, for unequal masses and simultaneously both black hole spins very large and aligned. Two older waveform models (PhenomC and SEOBNRv1) are found to be distinctly less accurate than the more recent PhenomD and SEOBNRv2 models. Finally, we quantify the bias expected from all four waveform models during parameter estimation for several recovered binary parameters: chirp mass, mass ratio, and effective spin.",1
77621,2,"Spin–orbit precession for eccentric black hole binaries at first order in the mass ratio We consider spin–orbit (‘geodetic’) precession for a compact binary in strong-field gravity. Specifically, we compute ψ, the ratio of the accumulated spin-precession and orbital angles over one radial period, for a spinning compact body of mass m (1) and spin s (1), with ${{s}_{1}}\ll Gm_{1}^{2}/c$ , orbiting a non-rotating black hole. We show that ψ can be computed for eccentric orbits in both the gravitational self-force and post-Newtonian frameworks, and that the results appear to be consistent. We present a post-Newtonian expansion for ψ at next-to-next-to-leading order, and a Lorenz-gauge gravitational self-force calculation for ψ at first order in the mass ratio. The latter provides new numerical data in the strong-field regime to inform the effective one-body model of the gravitational two-body problem. We conclude that ψ complements the Detweiler redshift z as a key invariant quantity characterizing eccentric orbits in the gravitational two-body problem.",1
77630,2,"Entangling power of time-evolution operators in integrable and nonintegrable many-body systems The entangling power and operator entanglement entropy are state independent measures of entanglement. Their growth and saturation is examined in the time-evolution operator of quantum many-body systems that can range from the integrable to the fully chaotic. An analytically solvable integrable model of the kicked transverse field Ising chain is shown to have ballistic growth of operator von Neumann entanglement entropy and exponentially fast saturation of the linear entropy with time. Surprisingly a fully chaotic model with longitudinal fields turned on shares the same growth phase, and is consistent with a random matrix model that is also exactly solvable for the linear entropy entanglements. However an examination of the entangling power shows that its largest value is significantly less than the nearly maximal value attained by the nonintegrable one. The importance of long-range spectral correlations, and not just the nearest neighbor spacing, is pointed out in determing the growth of entanglement in nonintegrable systems. Finally an interesting case that displays some features peculiar to both integrable and nonintegrable systems is briefly discussed.",1

On the basis of the continuum model for long-wavelength electronic excitations originating in the tight-binding approximation for the nearest-neighbor interaction of atoms in the crystal lattice, we consider quantum ground-state effects in Dirac materials with two-dimensional monolayer structures warped into nanocones by a disclination; the nonzero size of the disclination is taken into account, and a boundary condition at the edge of the disclination is chosen to ensure self-adjointness of the Dirac–Weyl Hamiltonian operator.

77726,2,"Study and Characterization of Magnetic Materials for Beam Intensity Monitors at CERN The number of particles in the beams used at CERN is measured by a family of devices called the Beam Current Transformers (BCTs). One of such devices is the DC Current Transformer (DCCT) measuring the total number of particles in an accelerator. The DCCT is built around a magnetic core made of a soft magnetic material. Currently, the DCCT cores are purchased from one of a few industrial partners. This situation might result in some significant issues with development of the DCCTs. Firstly, the choice of the core can be made only among the already developed and manufactured cores. Secondly, the industrial partners do not normally guarantee long-term availability of their products which could manifest itself as future maintenance problems. Thirdly, the cores available on the market have not been developed with CERN's intended application in mind and, hence, might be non-optimal for the DCCTs. These three factors, among others, led to a decision to investigate a possibility of in-house core manufacturing. BCT cores are made up of a soft magnetic material in ribbon-form between 20 and 30 microns thick, wound into a toroidal shape. They are amorphous or nanocrystalline cobalt and iron-based alloys that show high permeabilities and low coercivities. Several commercial alloys in their amorphous as-cast state were purchased after identifying the key parameters of the materials for the application, contacting suppliers and studying the available materials to find the most suitable ones. This choice was made by confronting the as-cast properties of the alloys with the needs of the instruments which would house the magnetic cores. The materials were then characterised to determine how to thermally treat them in order to obtain a range of different final magnetic properties. This study also resulted in establishing the best candidates to fabricate the sample cores. After this, three alloys were selected (iron-based alloy Finemet FT-3 from Metglas and two-cobalt based materials, 6025 G40 from Vacuumschmelze and 2705 M from Metglas) based on their as-cast properties. The cores and ribbons of the selected materials were then annealed at different temperatures and durations to study the effect of the treatment in both. Three treatments were done on the selected samples, below the Curie temperature, between the Curie and the crystallisation temperature and above the crystallisation temperature. Measurements of the samples were taken after the thermal treatment and compared to the results of the as-cast materials to see the effects of the annealing. This gave a range of different final materials with various permeability vs frequency behaviours, BH-curves and Barkhausen Noise. These new materials, in addition to the untreated as-cast ones, provide a good range of samples to choose from for applications with different needs. Based on the results presented in this thesis, one can suggest that the best material to build DCCT cores would be the iron-based nanocrystallised Metglas Finemet FT-3 material. It shows a high permeability up to 10 kHz, low coercivity and a rounded BH-curve. Regarding FBCTs, the cores need a very flat BH-curve with high permeability and minimum coercivity. From all the materials presented, Vacuumschmelze's cobalt-based Vitrovac 6025 G40 is the one that would be the most suitable. It has the lowest coercivity. However, the perfect material would need magnetic thermal annealing to create a high magnetic material anisotropy for a flat curve.",1

These goals will be achieved through a unique combination of instruments allowing GRB detection and arcmin localization over a broad FOV (more than 1sr) and an energy band extending from several MeVs down to 0.3 keV with unprecedented sensitivity, as well as on-board prompt (few minutes) follow-up with a 0.6m class IR telescope with both imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. Such instrumentation will also allow THESEUS to unveil and study the population of soft and sub-energetic GRBs, and, more in general, to perform monitoring and survey of the X-ray sky with unprecedented sensitivity.",1

77932,2,"CP-symmetry of order 4: model-building and phenomenology We present a multi-Higgs model dubbed CP4 3HDM which, remarkably, combines the
min-imality in its assumptions with phenomenological richness and predictivity.
It is based on a single assumption: the minimal multi-Higgs model to incorporate
CP-symmetry of order 4 (CP4) without producing accidental symmetries. It leads
to a unique three-doublet model with a constrained scalar potential which can be
worked out analytically. We describe two versions of this model: (i) when two
extra doublets are inert, CP4 is conserved and leads to a pair of scalar DM
candidates with peculiar properties, and (ii) when CP4 is extended to the Yukawa
sector, leading to a few very restricted cases, which can, nevertheless,
accommodate all fermion masses, mixing, and CP-violation. 1 Building bSM models:
balancing between the two extremes Many aspects of the Standard Model (SM) leave
theorists unsatisfied, including absence of dark matter (DM) candidates, its
ignorance of the origin of neutrino masses 1 and of CP-violation (CPV) 2 , as
well as quark and lepton mass and mixing hierarchies. These difficulties arise
partly due to the very minimalistic Higgs sector used in the SM, and this is why
many models beyond the SM (bSM) are based on extended Higgs sectors 3,4. When
building such models, one often tries to balance two requirements: keeping as
few extra assumptions as possible and producing a model well compatible with
experiment and sufficiently predictive to be tested in near future. One wants to
avoid two extreme cases: when one manages to describe all data at the expense of
excessively many new fields and assumptions, and the case when one produces a
neat compact bSM model with very few assumptions, which fails when compared to
the real world. A popular way to try to keep this balance is to constrain
interactions with extra global discrete symmetries 5,1. For example, a typical N
-Higgs-doublet model (NHDM) has hundreds of free parameters in the scalar and
Yukawa sectors. Imposing large non-abelian discrete symmetry groups reduces this
number to about a dozen, making the model highly predictive. It turns out,
however, that such models almost unavoidably lead to non-physical fermion
sectors 6 : for sufficiently large groups, there always remains some flavor
symmetry in the vacuum, which either leads to massless or mass-degenerate
fermions, or produces insufficient mixing or CPV. On the other hand, imposing
smaller symmetry groups such as Z 2 can lead to a good experimental fit",1

Such a fractional Berry phase is a consequence of Landau-level projection which produces the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman [S. M. Girvin, A. H. MacDonald, and P. M. Platzman, Phys. Rev.

For each case, we show that type Ia supernovae and H(z) data complement each other on the parameter space and tighter constrains for the transition redshift are obtained. By combining the type Ia supernovae observations and Hubble parameter measurements it is possible to constrain the values of zt, for each approach, as 0.806± 0.094, 0.870± 0.063 and 0.973± 0.058 at 1σ c.l., respectively.

78173,2,"On the nature of Hawking's incompleteness for the Einstein-vacuum equations: The regime of moderately spatially anisotropic initial data In the mathematical physics literature, there are heuristic arguments, going back three decades, suggesting that for an open set of initially smooth solutions to the Einstein-vacuum equations in high dimensions, stable, approximately monotonic curvature singularities can dynamically form along a spacelike hypersurface. In this article, we study the Cauchy problem and give a rigorous proof of this phenomenon in sufficiently high dimensions, thereby providing the first constructive proof of stable curvature blowup (without symmetry assumptions) along a spacelike hypersurface as an effect of pure gravity. Our proof applies to an open subset of regular initial data satisfying the assumptions of Hawking's celebrated ""singularity"" theorem, which shows that the solution is geodesically incomplete but does not reveal the nature of the incompleteness. Specifically, our main result is a proof of the dynamic stability of the Kasner curvature singularity for a subset of Kasner solutions whose metrics exhibit only moderately (as opposed to severely) spatially anisotropic behavior. Of independent interest is our method of proof, which is more robust than earlier approaches in that i) it does not rely on approximate monotonicity identities and ii) it accommodates the possibility that the solution develops very singular high-order spatial derivatives, whose blowup rates are allowed to be, within the scope of our bootstrap argument, much worse than those of the base-level quantities driving the fundamental blowup. For these reasons, our approach could be used to obtain similar blowup results for various Einstein-matter systems in any number of spatial dimensions for solutions corresponding to an open set of moderately spatially anisotropic initial data, thus going beyond the nearly spatially isotropic regime treated in earlier works.",1

Interesting H- beam loss mechanisms include residual gas stripping, H+ capture and acceleration, field stripping, black-body radiation and the recently discovered intra-beam stripping mechanism. Beam halo formation, and ion source or RF turn on/off transients, are examples of beam loss mechanisms that are common for both H+ and H- accelerators.

78368,2,"Quantum Error Correcting Codes in Eigenstates of Translation-Invariant Spin Chains Quantum error correction was invented to allow for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Systems with topological order turned out to give a natural physical realization of quantum error correcting codes (QECC) in their groundspaces. More recently, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, it has been argued that eigenstates of CFTs with a holographic dual should also form QECCs. These two examples raise the question of how generally eigenstates of many-body models form quantum codes. In this work we establish new connections between quantum chaos and translation-invariance in many-body spin systems, on one hand, and approximate quantum error correcting codes (AQECC), on the other hand. We first observe that quantum chaotic systems exhibiting the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) have eigenstates forming approximate quantum error-correcting codes. Then we show that AQECC can be obtained probabilistically from translation-invariant energy eigenstates of every translation-invariant spin chain, including integrable models. Applying this result to 1D classical systems, we describe a method for using local symmetries to construct parent Hamiltonians that embed these codes into the low-energy subspace of gapless 1D quantum spin chains. As explicit examples we obtain local AQECC in the ground space of the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the Motzkin spin chain model with periodic boundary conditions, thereby yielding non-stabilizer codes in the ground space and low energy subspace of physically plausible 1D gapless models.",1

Together with the results of [BLZ3, BHK], which enable one to associate quantum g^-KdV Hamiltonians to representations from the category O, this provides strong evidence for the conjecture of [FF5] linking the spectra of quantum g^-KdV Hamiltonians and affine opers for the Langlands dual affine algebra. As a bonus, we obtain a direct and uniform proof of the Bethe Ansatz equations for a large class of quantum integrable models associated to arbitrary untwisted quantum affine algebras, under a mild genericity condition. We also conjecture analogues of these results for the twisted quantum affine algebras and elucidate the notion of opers for twisted affine algebras, making a connection to twisted opers introduced in [FG].",1
78564,2,"On the $r$-Process Enrichment of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies Recent observations of Reticulum II have uncovered an overabundance of r-process elements compared to similar ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies (UFDs). Because the metallicity and star formation history of Reticulum II appear consistent with all known UFDs, the high r-process abundance of Reticulum II suggests enrichment through a single, rare event, such as a double neutron star (NS) merger. However, we note that this scenario is extremely unlikely, as binary stellar evolution models require significant supernova natal kicks to produce NS–NS or NS–black hole (BH) mergers, and these kicks would efficiently remove compact binary systems from the weak gravitational potentials of UFDs. We examine alternative mechanisms for the production of r-process elements in UFDs, including a novel mechanism wherein NSs in regions of high dark matter (DM) density implode after accumulating a BH-forming mass of DM. We find that r-process proto-material ejection by tidal forces, when a single NS implodes into a BH, can occur at a rate matching the r-process abundance of both Reticulum II and the Milky Way. Remarkably, DM models which collapse a single NS in observed UFDs also solve the missing pulsar problem in the Milky Way Galactic Center. We propose tests specific to DM r-process production which may uncover or rule out this model.",1

As an example of two-dimensional models, we study the Rashba Hamiltonian with time-dependent and anisotropic spin-orbit coupling. We show that the interplay between emergent electric fields and electric fields leads to a current transverse to electric fields, which is symmetric and contributes to the entropy production. As an example of three-dimensional models, we study the Weyl Hamiltonian under AC electric fields. We show that the interplay between emergent electric fields and magnetic fields leads to a Hall-type current at zero DC electric fields, which is now transverse to DC magnetic fields: $j_{x}=\sigma_{xy}B_y$ ($\sigma_{xy}=-\sigma_{yx}$).

78721,2,"Understanding transport simulations of heavy-ion collisions at 100A and 400A MeV: Comparison of heavy-ion transport codes under controlled conditions Transport simulations are very valuable for extracting physics information from heavy-ion-collision experiments. With the emergence of many different transport codes in recent years, it becomes important to estimate their robustness in extracting physics information from experiments. We report on the results of a transport-code-comparison project. Eighteen commonly used transport codes were included in this comparison: nine Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck-type codes and nine quantum-molecular-dynamics-type codes. These codes have been asked to simulate Au+Au collisions using the same physics input for mean fields and for in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, as well as the same impact parameter, the similar initialization setup, and other calculational parameters at 100A and 400A MeV incident energy. Among the codes we compare one-body observables such as rapidity and transverse flow distributions. We also monitor nonobservables such as the initialization of the internal states of colliding nuclei and their stability, the collision rates, and the Pauli blocking. We find that not completely identical initializations may have contributed partly to different evolutions. Different strategies to determine the collision probabilities and to enforce the Pauli blocking also produce considerably different results. There is a substantial spread in the predictions for the observables, which is much smaller at the higher incident energy. We quantify the uncertainties in the collective flow resulting from the simulation alone as about 30% at 100A MeV and 13% at 400A MeV, respectively. We propose further steps within the code comparison project to test the different aspects of transport simulations in a box calculation of infinite nuclear matter. This should, in particular, improve the robustness of transport model predictions at lower incident energies, where abundant amounts of data are available.",1

78794,2,"R-modes and neutron star recycling scenario To put new constraints on the r-mode instability window, we analyse the formation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) within the recycling scenario, making use of three sets of observations: (a) X-ray observations of neutron stars (NSs) in low-mass X-ray binaries; (b) timing of MSPs and (c) X-ray and UV observations of MSPs. As shown in previous works, r-mode dissipation by shear viscosity is not sufficient to explain observational set (a), and enhanced r-mode dissipation at the redshifted internal temperatures T ^∞ ∼ 10^8 K is required to stabilize the observed NSs. Here, we argue that models with enhanced bulk viscosity can hardly lead to a self-consistent explanation of observational set (a) due to strong neutrino emission, which is typical for these models (unrealistically powerful energy source is required to keep NSs at the observed temperatures.). We also demonstrate that the observational set (b), combined with the theory of internal heating and NS cooling, provides evidence of enhanced r-mode dissipation at low temperatures, T ^∞ ∼ 2 × 10^7 K. Observational set (c) allows us to set an upper limit on the internal temperatures of MSPs, T ^∞ < 2 × 10^7 K (assuming a canonical NS with the accreted crust). Recycling scenario can produce MSPs at these temperatures only if r-mode instability is suppressed in the whole MSP spin frequency range (ν ≲ 750 Hz) at temperatures 2 × 10^7 ≲ T ^∞ ≲ 3 × 10^7 K, providing thus a new constraint on the r-mode instability window.

79119,2,"CMB Lensing Bispectrum from Nonlinear Growth of the Large Scale Structure We discuss detectability of the nonlinear growth of the large-scale structure in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing.

The reconstructed CMB lensing signals are useful to constrain cosmology via their angular power spectrum, while detectability and cosmological application of their bispectrum induced by the nonlinear evolution are not well studied. Extending the analytic estimate of the galaxy lensing bispectrum presented by Takada and Jain (2004) to the CMB case, we show that even near term CMB experiments such as Advanced ACT, Simons Array and SPT3G could detect the CMB lensing bispectrum induced by the nonlinear growth of the large-scale structure. In the case of the CMB Stage-IV, we find that the lensing bispectrum is detectable at ≳50σ statistical significance. This precisely measured lensing bispectrum has rich cosmological information, and could be used to constrain cosmology, e.g., the sum of the neutrino masses and the dark-energy properties.",1
79446,2,"Vacuum Dynamics in the Universe versus a Rigid ∧ = const. In this year, in which we celebrate 100 years of the cosmological term, ∧, in Einstein’s gravitational field equations, we are still facing the crucial question whether ∧ is truly a fundamental constant or a mildly evolving dynamical variable. After many theoretical attempts to understand the meaning of ∧, and in view of the enhanced accuracy of the cosmological observations, it seems now mandatory that this issue should be first settled empirically before further theoretical speculations on its ultimate nature. In this review, we summarize the situation of some of these studies. Devoted analyses made recently show that the ∧ = const. hypothesis, despite being the simplest, may well not be the most favored one. The overall fit to the cosmological observables SNIa + BAO + H(z) + LSS + BBN + CMB single out the class of “running” vacuum models (RVMs), in which ∧ = ∧(H) is an affine power-law function of the Hubble rate. It turns out that the performance of the RVM as compared to the “concordance” ∧CDM model (with ∧ = const.) is much better. The evidence in support of the RVM may reach ∼ 4σ c.l., and is bolstered with Akaike and Bayesian criteria providing strong evidence in favor of the RVM option. We also address the implications of this framework on the tension between the CMB and local measurements of the current Hubble parameter.",1
79484,2,"Thermal conditions on the International Space Station: Heat flux and temperature investigation of main radiators for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer The investigation on heat flux can clarify the thermal condition and explain temperature behavior on the main radiators of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). In this paper, a detailed investigation of heat flux on the AMS main radiators is proposed. The heat transfer process of the AMS main radiators is theoretically analyzed. An updated thermal model of the AMS on the International Space Station (ISS) is developed to calculate the external heat flux density on the AMS main radiators. We conclude the ISS components and operations affect on the solar flux density of the AMS main radiators by reflecting or shading solar illumination. According to the energy conservation on the AMS main radiators, the temperature variation mainly depends on the solar flux change. The investigations are conducive to reference for the long-duration thermal control of the AMS, and knowledge for the thermal conditions on the ISS.",1
79581,2,"Aplicaciones de soluciones no homogéneas de las ecuaciones de Einstein a problemas cosmológicos The accelerated expansion of the universe is one of the most important features of the Standard
Cosmological Model. The observational evidence that support such expansion, interpreted
in the context of that model (which is based on General Relativity and the hypothesis of
homogeneity and isotropy), indicates that the universe is dominated by the so-called “dark
energy” in a proportion 7/3 with respect to dark matter. This unknown fluid presents peculiar
features: a negative pressure (that is, tension) and a smooth distribution (because it is not
collected into potencial wells). This scenario suggests that the standar model must be revised.
The topic of this thesis is the study of inhomogeneous exact solutions of Einstein’s equations,
and their applications to solve different cosmological problems. Motivated by the dark
energy problem, the aim of our work is to investigate inhomogeneous cosmological models as
a viable alternative to describe astronomical observations without including dark energy.
In particular, we are interesting in those solutions with spherical symmetry, such as the
Lemaˆıtre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) and the Lemaˆıtre solutions, which describe perfect fluids of
dust and radiation, respectively. We will also discuss some aspects of the Sz´ekeres solution.
We will apply the inhomogeneous solutions to investigate three specific cosmological issues:
1. The redshift drift in cosmological models. Among the cosmological observables, the redshift
drift (that is, the rate of change of the cosmological redshift) has been studied with
increasing interest due to its potential to distinguish between different cosmological models.
Since there are good prospects to observe the redshift drift in the next decade, it
is important to develop theoretical approaches that allow the forecast of its features in
a given cosmological model.
2. Inhomogeneous initial conditions for inflation. Although inflation is specifically designed
to solve some of the problems of the Standard Cosmological Model, it is not free of its
own problems. Among these, perhaps the most relevant ones are those related to the
beginning of inflation in the presence of inhomogeneities, and the evolution of an inflating
region in an inhomogeneous ambient. Motivated by this scenario, we will study generic
inhomogeneous initial conditions for inflation, in both dust and radiation inhomogeneous
backgrounds.
3. Spherically symmetric void models with dust and radiation. Spherically symmetric void
models with dust and (non-comoving) radiation have been carefully studied with the
aim of describing current cosmological observations without using dark energy. In this
context, we will study the effects due to the anisotropic pressure of the radiation in the
early evolution of the geometry.
We will conclude with some remarks on inhomogeneous cosmological models and the observational
perspectives that would allow to distinguish between cosmologies in the near future.",1
79627,2,"Towards robust design of thin film transition edge sensors for use in the next-generation superconducting radio frequency cavities In order to increase the accelerating gradient, the next-generation of Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities will be operated with superfluid helium cooling. This upgrade requires the development of a state-of-the-art cryogenic temperature mapping system, which can be used to identify quench initiation in new cavities, and thereby assess their suitability for installation. This paper presents a new mapping system based on an array of Transition Edge Sensors (TESs): electrical devices that exploit the superconducting transition of a thin film to identify temperature changes.

The TES array is manufactured using photolithography to deposit a thin film on a 100 mm diameter glass wafer. Two different designs of Au-Sn TES have been assessed; Design 1 was composed of a 10 nm Cr adhesive layer, followed by 20 nm of Au and 100 nm of Sn, and Design 2 was identical except that the Cr layer was not applied.

Design 1 showed excellent film adherence, however no superconducting transition was observed. In contrast, Design 2 showed poor film bonding but a superconducting transition. These insights are being used to design a new cryogenic temperature mapping device that combines Design 1 for robust electrical contacts and Design 2 for second sound detection.",1
79679,2,Simulation and Fabrication of a KID Sensor for the CMB Polarization Measurement We designed prototype Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID) to test sensors for a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. The design has been simulated extensively with a commercially available software for the optimization of the KID sensor. A coplanar waveguide type photo mask is designed and a KID sensor is fabricated with Nb thin film. The goal of this design and fabrication of the protype KID is to understand behaviors of basic design parameters and fundamental properties of the sensor. The basic resonator parameters are measured and their implications are discussed.,1

Nuclear emulsion can determines incident gamma-ray angle measuring electron positron track right after the conversion with small material thickness (.002 radiation length par film). Thanks of this small thickness, angular resolution can reach 0.1° for 1 GeV gamma-ray (1.0° for 100 MeV) and it can be sensitive to polarization. GRAINE could bring precise observation of gamma-ray sources especially on the galactic plane by repeating long-duration flights with large aperture (10m2) emulsion telescope. In May 2015, we launched an emulsion telescope of 0.38 m2 aperture area from Alice Springs, Australia in order to demonstrate the overall imaging performance. Flight duration time was about 14.4 hours with 11.5 hours level flight at 37km altitude including 6 hours with the Vela pulsar in the field of view. Latest results and future plans are described.",1

79870,2,"Fall to the Centre in Atom Traps and Point-Particle EFT for Absorptive Systems Polarizable atoms interacting with a charged wire do so through an inverse-square potential, $V = - g/r^2$. This system is known to realize scale invariance in a nontrivial way and to be subject to ambiguities associated with the choice of boundary condition at the origin, often termed the problem of `fall to the center'. Point-particle effective field theory (PPEFT) provides a systematic framework for determining the boundary condition in terms of the properties of the source residing at the origin. We apply this formalism to the charged-wire/polarizable-atom problem, finding a result that is not a self-adjoint extension because of absorption of atoms by the wire. We explore the RG flow of the complex coupling constant for the dominant low-energy effective interactions, finding flows whose character is qualitatively different when $g$ is above or below a critical value, $g_c$. Unlike the self-adjoint case, (complex) fixed points exist when $g> g_c$, which we show correspond to perfect absorber (or perfect emitter) boundary conditions. We describe experimental consequences for wire-atom interactions and the possibility of observing the anomalous breaking of scale invariance.",1

79897,2,"Model-independent analyses of non-Gaussianity in Planck CMB maps using Minkowski functionals Despite the wealth of Planck results, there are difficulties in disentangling the primordial non-Gaussianity of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the secondary and the foreground non-Gaussianity (NG). For each of these forms of NG the lack of complete data introduces model-dependences. Aiming at detecting the NGs of the CMB temperature anisotropy $\delta T$ , while paying particular attention to a model-independent quantification of NGs, our analysis is based upon statistical and morphological univariate descriptors, respectively: the probability density function $P(\delta T)$ , related to v(0), the first Minkowski Functional (MF), and the two other MFs, v(1) and v(2). From their analytical Gaussian predictions we build the discrepancy functions ${{ \Delta }_{k}}$ (k  =  P, 0, 1, 2) which are applied to an ensemble of 10(5) CMB realization maps of the $ \Lambda $ CDM model and to the Planck CMB maps. In our analysis we use general Hermite expansions of the ${{ \Delta }_{k}}$ up to the 12th order, where the coefficients are explicitly given in terms of cumulants. Assuming hierarchical ordering of the cumulants, we obtain the perturbative expansions generalizing the second order expansions of Matsubara to arbitrary order in the standard deviation ${{\sigma}_{0}}$ for $P(\delta T)$ and v(0), where the perturbative expansion coefficients are explicitly given in terms of complete Bell polynomials. The comparison of the Hermite expansions and the perturbative expansions is performed for the $ \Lambda $ CDM map sample and the Planck data. We confirm the weak level of non-Gaussianity (1–2)σ of the foreground corrected masked Planck 2015 maps.",1

Spin-dependent terms of the ESC08a version of the $\Lambda NG$ interactions are tested and phenomenologically tuned to reproduce observed energy spectra in $p$-shell $^{A}_\Lambda Z$. Spin-dependent contributions of the $\Lambda N$ interactions to spin-doublet splitting and excitation energies are discussed. Energy spectra for unobserved excited states in $p$-shell $^{A}_\Lambda Z$ and $^{19}_{\Lambda}\textrm{F}$ are predicted with the modified $\Lambda NG$ interactions.,1
80013,2,"Cluster expansion for ground states of local Hamiltonians A central problem in many-body quantum physics is the determination of the ground state of a thermodynamically large physical system. We construct a cluster expansion for ground states of local Hamiltonians, which naturally incorporates physical requirements inherited by locality as conditions on its cluster amplitudes. Applying a diagrammatic technique we derive the relation of these amplitudes to thermodynamic quantities and local observables. Moreover we derive a set of functional equations that determine the cluster amplitudes for a general Hamiltonian, verify the consistency with perturbation theory and discuss non-perturbative approaches. Lastly we verify the persistence of locality features of the cluster expansion under unitary evolution with a local Hamiltonian and provide applications to out-of-equilibrium problems: a simplified proof of equilibration to the GGE and a cumulant expansion for the statistics of work, for an interacting-to-free quantum quench.",1

80101,2,"Short Electron Bunch Generation Using Single-Cycle Ultrafast Electron Guns We introduce a solution for producing ultrashort (∼fs) high charge (∼pC) from ultracompact guns utilizing single-cycle THz pulses. We show that the readily available THz pulses with energies as low as 20  μJ are sufficient to generate multi-10 keV electron bunches. Moreover, it is demonstrated that THz energies of 2 mJ are sufficient to generate relativistic electron bunches with higher than 2 MeV energy. The high acceleration gradients possible in the structures provide 30 fs electron bunches at 30 keV energy and 45 fs bunches at 2 MeV energy. These structures will underpin future devices for strong field THz physics in general and miniaturized electron guns, in which the high fields combined with the short pulse duration enable electron beams with ultrahigh brightness.",1
80121,2,"CRPropa 3.1—a low energy extension based on stochastic differential equations The propagation of charged cosmic rays through the Galactic environment influences all aspects of the observation at Earth. Energy spectrum, composition and arrival directions are changed due to deflections in magnetic fields and interactions with the interstellar medium. Today the transport is simulated with different simulation methods either based on the solution of a transport equation (multi-particle picture) or a solution of an equation of motion (single-particle picture). We developed a new module for the publicly available propagation software CRPropa 3.1, where we implemented an algorithm to solve the transport equation using stochastic differential equations. This technique allows us to use a diffusion tensor which is anisotropic with respect to an arbitrary magnetic background field. The source code of CRPropa is written in C++ with python steering via SWIG which makes it easy to use and computationally fast. In this paper, we present the new low-energy propagation code together with validation procedures that are developed to proof the accuracy of the new implementation. Furthermore, we show first examples of the cosmic ray density evolution, which depends strongly on the ratio of the parallel κ(∥) and perpendicular κ(⊥) diffusion coefficients. This dependency is systematically examined as well the influence of the particle rigidity on the diffusion process.",1

An algorithm for numerical solution of the partial equations for scattering states of the particles with nonzero orbital angular momentum is presented.,1
80223,2,"Structure formation simulations with momentum exchange: alleviating tensions between high-redshift and low-redshift cosmological probes Persisting tensions between the cosmological constraints derived from low-redshift probes and the ones obtained from temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) – although not yet providing compelling evidence against the Λcold dark matter model – seem to consistently indicate a slower growth of density perturbations as compared to the predictions of the standard cosmological scenario. Such behaviour is not easily accommodated by the simplest extensions of General Relativity, such as f(R) models, which generically predict an enhanced growth rate. In this work, we present the outcomes of a suite of large N-body simulations carried out in the context of a cosmological model featuring a non-vanishing scattering cross-section between the dark matter and the dark energy fields, for two different parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state. Our results indicate that these dark scattering models have very mild effects on many observables related to large-scale structures formation and evolution, while providing a significant suppression of the amplitude of linear density perturbations and the abundance of massive clusters. Our simulations therefore confirm that these models offer a promising route to alleviate existing tensions between low-redshift measurements and those of the CMB.",1

We sum up the main results for the transfer matrix spectral problem for the cyclic representations of the trigonometric 6-vertex reflection algebra associated to the Bazanov-Stroganov Lax operator. These results apply as well to the spectral analysis of the lattice sine-Gordon model with open boundary conditions. The transfer matrix spectrum (both eigenvalues and eigenstates) is completely characterized in terms of the set of solutions to a discrete system of polynomial equations.

80446,2,"Determination of Beam Coupling Impedance in the Frequency Domain The concept of beam coupling impedance describes the electromagnetic interaction of uniformly moving charged particles with their surrounding structures in the Frequency Domain (FD). In synchrotron accelerators, beam coupling impedances can lead to beam induced component heating and coherent beam instabilities. Thus, in order to ensure the stable operation of a synchrotron, its impedances have to be quantified and their effects have to be controlled. Nowadays, beam coupling impedances are mostly obtained by Fourier transform of wake potentials, which are the results of Time Domain (TD) simulations. However, at low frequencies, low beam velocity, or for dispersive materials, TD simulations become unhandy. In this area, analytical calculations of beam coupling impedance in the FD, combined with geometry approximations, are still widely used. This thesis describes the development of two electromagnetic field solvers to obtain the beam coupling impedance directly in the FD, where the beam velocity is only a parameter and dispersive materials can be included easily. One solver is based on the Finite Integration Technique (FIT) on a staircase mesh. It is implemented both in 2D and 3D. However, the staircase mesh is inefficient on curved structures, which is particularly problematic for the modeling of a dipole source, that is required for the computation of the transverse beam coupling impedance. This issue is overcome by the second solver developed in this thesis, which is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) on an unstructured triangular mesh. It is implemented in 2D and includes an optional Surface Impedance Boundary Condition (SIBC). Thus, it is well suited for the computation of longitudinal and transverse impedances of long beam pipe structures of arbitrary cross-section. Besides arbitrary frequency and beam velocity, also dispersive materials can be chosen, which is crucial for the computation of the impedance of ferrite kicker magnets. Numerical impedance simulations always contain simplifications, therefore they have to be confirmed by dedicated measurements. However, the beam coupling impedance of a single accelerator component cannot be measured directly. Therefore, a dedicated RF-laboratory was established at GSI, in order to measure broadband beam coupling impedances on the bench by means of the wire method, i.e. without beam. A detailed analysis of measurement methods is given by comparison of analytical, numerical, and measurement results for simplified accelerator devices. One conclusion is, that also the bench measurements have to be validated by dedicated electromagnetic simulations. The thesis closes with selected impedance induced effects on the beam revolving in the synchrotron and relevant impedance results for the future SIS-100 synchrotron for the FAIR project at GSI.",1
80464,2,"Torsional Newton–Cartan gravity from the large c expansion of general relativity We revisit the manifestly covariant large c expansion of general relativity, c being the speed of light. Assuming the relativistic connection has no pole in $c^{-2}$ , this expansion is known to reproduce Newton–Cartan gravity and a covariant version of post-Newtonian corrections to it. We show that relaxing this assumption leads to the inclusion of twistless torsion in the effective non-relativistic theory. We argue that the resulting twistless torsion Newton–Cartan theory is an effective description of a non-relativistic regime of general relativity that extends Newtonian physics by including strong gravitational time dilation.",1
80477,2,"Design and deployment of an elastic network test-bed in IHEP data center based on SDN High energy physics experiments produce huge amounts of raw data, while because of the sharing characteristics of the network resources, there is no guarantee of the available bandwidth for each experiment which may cause link congestion problems.

However, under the traditional network architecture, network capability can’t be required elastically, which becomes the bottleneck of restricting the flexible application of cloud computing. In order to solve the above problems, we propose an elastic cloud data center network architecture based on SDN, and we also design a high performance controller cluster based on OpenDaylight. In the end, we present our current test results.",1
80503,2,"Transport coefficients of leptons in superconducting neutron star cores I consider the thermal conductivity and shear viscosity of leptons (electrons and muons) in the nucleon NS cores where protons are in the superconducting state. I restrict the consideration to the case of not too high temperatures $T\lesssim 0.35T_{\mathrm{c}p}$, where $T_{\mathrm{c}p}$ is the critical temperature of the proton pairing. In this case, lepton collisions with protons can be neglected. Charged lepton collision frequencies are mainly determined by the transverse plasmon exchange and are mediated by the character of the transverse plasma screening. In our previous works [Shternin \& Yakovlev, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 75} 103004 (2007); {\bf 78} 063006 (2008)] the superconducting proton contribution to the transverse screening was considered in the Pippard limit $\Delta \ll \hbar q v_{\mathrm{F}p}$, where $\Delta$ is the proton pairing gap, $v_{\mathrm{F}p}$ is the proton Fermi velocity, and $\hbar q$ is the typical transferred momentum in collisions. However, for large critical temperatures (large $\Delta$) and relatively small densities (small $q$) the Pippard limit may become invalid. In the present study I show that this is indeed the case and that the older calculations severely underestimated the screening in a certain range of the parameters appropriate to the NS cores. As a consequence, the values of the kinetic coefficients at $T\ll T_{\mathrm{c}p}$ are found to be smaller than in previous calculations.",1
80518,2,"Effect of quadrupole focusing-field fluctuation on the transverse stability of intense hadron beams in storage rings A systematic experimental study is performed to clarify the parameter dependence of the noise-induced beam instability previously demonstrated by a Princeton group [M. Chung et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 145003 (2009)]. Because of the weakness of the driving force, the instability develops very slowly, which substantially limits the application of conventional experimental and numerical techniques. In the present study, a novel tabletop apparatus called “S-POD” (Simulator of Particle Orbit Dynamics) is employed to explore the long-term collective behavior of intense hadron beams. S-POD provides a many-body Coulomb system physically equivalent to a relativistic charged-particle beam and thus enables us to conduct various beam-dynamics experiments without the use of large-scale machines. It is reconfirmed that random noise on the linear beam-focusing potential can be a source of slow beam quality degradation. Experimental observations are explained well by a simple perturbation theory that predicts the existence of a series of dangerous noise frequency bands overlooked in the previous study. Those additional instability bands newly identified with S-POD are more important practically because the driving noise frequencies can be very low. The dependence of the instability on the noise level, operating tune, and beam intensity is examined and found consistent with theoretical predictions.",1

Such kind of basis could be treated as a nested generalization of separation of variables (SoV) basis for high-rank quantum integrable models. It is found that all the monodromy-matrix elements acting on a basis vector take simple forms. With the help of the basis, we construct eigenstates of the su(3) inhomogeneous spin torus (the trigonometric su(3) spin chain with antiperiodic boundary condition) from its spectrum obtained via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz (ODBA). Based on small sites (i.e. N = 2) check, it is conjectured that the homogeneous limit of the eigenstates exists, which gives rise to the corresponding eigenstates of the homogenous model.",1

We prove that the spectrum of operators of quantum multiplication by these quantum classes is governed by the Bethe ansatz equations for the inhomogeneous $XXZ$ spin chain. In addition, we prove that each such operator corresponds to the universal elements of quantum group $\mathcal{U}_{\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. In particular, we identify the Baxter operator for the $XXZ$ spin chain with the operator of quantum multiplication by the exterior algebra tautological bundle. The explicit universal combinatorial formula for this operator is found. The relation between quantum line bundles and quantum dynamical Weyl group is shown.",1
80606,2,"The Flow Constraint Influence on the Properties of Nuclear Matter Critical Endpoint We propose a novel family of equations of state for symmetric nuclear matter based on the induced surface tension concept for the hard-core repulsion. It is shown that having only four adjustable parameters the suggested equations of state can, simultaneously, reproduce not only the main properties of the nuclear matter ground state, but the proton flow constraint up its maximal particle number densities. Varying the model parameters we carefully examine the range of values of incompressibility constant of normal nuclear matter and its critical temperature, which are consistent with the proton flow constraint. This analysis allows us to show that the physically most justified value of nuclear matter critical temperature is 15.5–18 MeV, the incompressibility constant is 270–315 MeV and the hard-core radius of nucleons is less than 0.4 fm.",1

80719,2,P13 an ULX that is a potential progenitor of merging BH-NS system We have studied the future evolution of a recently discovered ULX source P13 in NGC7793. This source was shown to contain a 5-15$M_{\odot}$ black hole and a massive 18-23$M_{\odot}$ B9Ia companion on a 64 day orbit. For low black hole mass (5-10$M_{\odot}$) and high companion mass $\gtrsim 20 M_{\odot}$ the binary is predicted to initiate a common envelope evolution in near future and significantly decrease the orbital separation (6 hr orbit). This leads to a high probability ($\sim70\%$) of the system surviving a supernova explosion that will form a neutron star out of the companion. About one third of the surviving BH-NS systems will merge within Hubble time and be a source of high frequency gravitational radiation. We estimate that the chances of detection of BH-NS systems with advanced LIGO/Virgo that form via P13-evolutionary channel are at the level of 0.1 yr$^{-1}$ with wide range of allowed probability $0 \div 0.6$yr$^{-1}$. This is the fourth empirical estimate of BH-NS merger rate.,1

80965,2,"Thermocurrents and their role in high $Q$ cavity performance Over the past years it became evident that the quality factor of a superconducting cavity is not only determined by its surface preparation procedure, but is also influenced by the way the cavity is cooled down. Moreover, different data sets exist, some of which indicate that a slow cooldown through the critical temperature is favorable while other data states the exact opposite. Even though there were speculations and some models about the role of thermocurrents and flux-pinning, the difference in behavior remained a mystery. In this paper we will present a consistent theoretical model which we confirmed by data that describes the role of thermocurrents, driven by temperature gradients and material transitions. We will clearly show how they impact the quality factor of a cavity, discuss our findings, relate it to findings at other labs and develop mitigation strategies which especially address the issue of achieving high quality factors of so-called nitrogen doped cavities in horizontal tests.",1

It combines automatic test generation, self-checking testbenches, and coverage metrics to indicate progress in the design verification. The flow of the CDV differs from the traditional directed-testing approach. With the CDV, a testbench developer, by setting the verification goals, starts with an structured plan. Those goals are targeted further by a developed testbench, which generates legal stimuli and sends them to a device under test (DUT). The progress is measured by coverage monitors added to the simulation environment. In this way, the non-exercised functionality can be identified. Moreover, the additional scoreboards indicate undesired DUT behaviour. Such verification environments were developed for three recent ASIC and FPGA projects which have successfully implemented the new work-flow: (1) the CLICpix2 65 nm CMOS hybrid pixel readout ASIC design; (2) the C3PD 180 nm HV-CMOS active sensor ASIC design; (3) the FPGA-based DAQ system of the CLICpix chip. This paper, based on the experience from the above projects, introduces briefly UVM and presents a set of tips and advices applicable at different stages of the verification process-cycle.",1
81273,2,"Model-independent Confirmation of the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation The cosmic distance duality (CDD) relation (also known as the Etherington relation) plays a crucial role in a wide assortment of cosmological measurements. Attempts at confirming it observationally have met with mixed results, though the general consensus appears to be that the data do support its existence in nature. A common weakness with past approaches has been their reliance on a specific cosmological model, or on measurements of the luminosity distance to Type Ia SNe, which introduces a model dependence in spite of beliefs to the contrary. Confirming that the CDD is actually realized in the cosmos is crucial because its violation would require exotic new physics. In this paper, we present a true model-independent study of the CDD based on the observed angular size of compact quasar cores and a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the HII galaxy Hubble diagram---without the assumption of any background cosmology. In so doing, we confirm at a very high level of confidence that the angular-diameter and luminosity distances do indeed satisfy the CDD. We demonstrate the potential power of this result by utilizing it in a comparative test of two competing cosmological models---the R_h=ct universe and LCDM---and show that R_h=ct is favoured by the CDD data with a likelihood ~82.3% compared with ~17.7% for the standard model.",1

81339,2,"Mount Aragats as a stable electron accelerator for atmospheric high-energy physics research Observation of the numerous thunderstorm ground enhancements (TGEs), i.e., enhanced fluxes of electrons, gamma rays, and neutrons detected by particle detectors located on the Earth’s surface and related to the strong thunderstorms above it, helped to establish a new scientific topic—high-energy physics in the atmosphere. Relativistic runaway electron avalanches (RREAs) are believed to be a central engine initiating high-energy processes in thunderstorm atmospheres. RREAs observed on Mount Aragats in Armenia during the strongest thunderstorms and simultaneous measurements of TGE electron and gamma-ray energy spectra proved that RREAs are a robust and realistic mechanism for electron acceleration. TGE research facilitates investigations of the long-standing lightning initiation problem. For the last 5 years we were experimenting with the “beams” of “electron accelerators” operating in the thunderclouds above the Aragats research station. Thunderstorms are very frequent above Aragats, peaking in May–June, and almost all of them are accompanied with enhanced particle fluxes. The station is located on a plateau at an altitude 3200 asl near a large lake. Numerous particle detectors and field meters are located in three experimental halls as well as outdoors; the facilities are operated all year round. All relevant information is being gathered, including data on particle fluxes, fields, lightning occurrences, and meteorological conditions. By the example of the huge thunderstorm that took place at Mount Aragats on August 28, 2015, we show that simultaneous detection of all the relevant data allowed us to reveal the temporal pattern of the storm development and to investigate the atmospheric discharges and particle fluxes.",1
81391,2,"The KW Equations and the Nahm Pole Boundary Condition with Knots It is conjectured that the coefficients of the Jones polynomial can be computed by counting solutions of the KW equations on a four-dimensional half-space, with certain boundary conditions that depend on a knot. The boundary conditions are defined by a ""Nahm pole"" away from the knot with a further singularity along the knot. In a previous paper, we gave a precise formulation of the Nahm pole boundary condition in the absence of knots, in the present paper, we do this in the more general case with knots included. We show that the KW equations with generalized Nahm pole boundary conditions are elliptic, and that the solutions are polyhomogeneous near the boundary and near the knot, with exponents determined by solutions of appropriate indicial equations. This involves the analysis of a ""depth two incomplete iterated edge operator.""

The locations of the two quads have to be chosen such that the disturbance to the beam optics is minimum. The emittance growth has to be mitigated for this method to work. In addition, this technique needs very accurate jump timing. Using two partial Siberian snakes, with vertical tune inside the spin tune gap and 80% polarization at AGS injection, polarized proton beam had reached 1.5 × 1011 proton per bunch with 65% polarization.

Various combinations of the magnetic sections of the Super-FRS can be operated in dispersive, achromatic or dispersion-matched spectrometer ion-optical modes, which allow measurements of momentum distributions of secondary-reaction products with high resolution and precision. A number of unique experiments in atomic, nuclear and hadron physics are suggested with the Super-FRS as a stand-alone device, in particular searches for new isotopes, studies of hypernuclei, delta-resonances in exotic nuclei and spectroscopy of atoms characterized by bound mesons. Rare decay modes like multiple-proton or neutron emission and the nuclear tensor force observed in high-momentum regime can be also addressed.

81667,2,"Performance evaluation of a klystron beam focusing system with anisotropic ferrite magnet A klystron beam focusing system using permanent magnets, which increases reliability in comparison with an electromagnetic focusing system, is reported. A prototype model has been designed and fabricated for a 1.3 GHz, 800 kW klystron for evaluation of the feasibility of focusing systems with permanent magnets. In order to decrease the production cost and to mitigate the complex tuning processes of the magnetic field, an anisotropic ferrite magnet is adopted as the magnetic material. As the result of a power test, 798±8 kW peak output power was successfully achieved with the prototype focusing system. Considering the power consumption of an electromagnetic focusing system, the required wall-plug power to produce a nominal 800 kW output power with the permanent magnet system is less than that with an electromagnet. However, the power conversion efficiency of the klystron with the permanent magnet system was found to be limited by transverse multipole magnetic fields. By decreasing the transverse multipole magnetic field components, especially the dipole and the quadrupole, the power conversion efficiency would approach that with electromagnets.",1
81770,2,"Singular dynamics and emergence of nonlocality in long-range quantum models We discuss how nonlocality originates in long-range quantum systems and how it affects their dynamics at and out of equilibrium. We focus in particular on the Kitaev chains with long-range pairings and on the quantum Ising chain with long-range antiferromagnetic coupling (both having a power-law decay with exponent α). By studying the dynamic correlation functions, we find that for every finite α two different behaviours can be identified, one typical of short-range systems and the other connected with locality violation. The latter behaviour is shown related also with the known power-law decay tails previously observed in the static correlation functions, and originated by modes—having in general energies far from the minima of the spectrum—where particular singularities develop as a consequence of the long-rangedness of the system. We refer to these modes as to ‘singular’ modes, and as to ‘singular dynamics’ to their dynamics. For the Kitaev model they are manifest, at finite α, in derivatives of the quasiparticle energy, the order of the derivatives at which the singularity occurs is increasing with α. The features of the singular modes and their physical consequences are clarified by studying an effective theory for them and by a critical comparison of the results from this theory with the lattice ones. Moreover, a numerical study of the effects of the singular modes on the time evolution after various types of global quenches is performed. We finally present and discuss the presence of singular modes and their consequences in interacting long-range systems by investigating in the long-range Ising quantum chain, both in the deep paramagnetic regime and at criticality, where they also play a central role for the breakdown of conformal invariance.",1
81781,2,"Falsifying cosmological models based on a non-linear electrodynamics Recently, the nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) has been gaining attention to generate primordial magnetic fields in the Universe and also to resolve singularity problems. Moreover, recent works have shown the crucial role of the NED on the inflation. This paper provides a new approach based on a new model of NED as a source of gravitation to remove the cosmic singularity at the big bang and explain the cosmic acceleration during the inflation era on the background of stochastic magnetic field. Also, we found a realization of a cyclic Universe, free of initial singularity, due to the proposed NED energy density. In addition, we explore whether a NED field without or with matter can be the origin of the late-time acceleration. For this we obtain explicit equations for H(z) and perform a MCMC analysis to constrain the NED parameters by using 31 observational Hubble data (OHD) obtained from cosmic chronometers covering the redshift range $0< z < 1.97$ , and with the joint-light-analysis (JLA) SNIa compilation consisting in 740 data points in the range $0.01<z<1.2$ . All our constraints on the current magnetic field give $B_{0}\sim 10^{-31}\mathrm {cm^{-1}}$ , which are larger than the upper limit $10^{-33}\mathrm {cm^{-1}}$ by the Planck satellite implying that NED cosmologies could not be suitable to explain the Universe late-time dynamics. However, the current data is able to falsify the scenario at late times. Indeed, one is able to reconstruct the deceleration parameter q(z) using the best fit values of the parameters obtained from OHD and SNIa data sets. If the matter component is not included, the data sets predict an accelerated phase in the early Universe, but a non accelerated Universe is preferred in the current epoch. When a matter component is included in the NED cosmology, the data sets predict a q(z) dynamics similar to that of the standard model. Moreover, both cosmological data favor up to $2\sigma $ confidence levels an accelerating expansion in the current epoch, i.e., the Universe passes of a decelerated phase to an accelerated stage at redshift $\sim 0.6$ . Therefore, although the NED cosmology with dust matter predict a value $B_{0}$ higher than the one measured by Planck satellite, it is able to drive a late-time cosmic acceleration which is consistent with our dynamical systems analysis and it is preferred by OHD and SNIa data sets.",1
82016,2,"de Sitter invariant special relativity and galaxy rotation curves Owing to the existence of an invariant length at the Planck scale, Einstein special relativity breaks down at that scale. A possible solution to this problem is arguably to replace the Poincar\'e-invariant Einstein special relativity by a de Sitter invariant special relativity. Such replacement produces concomitant changes in all relativistic theories, including general relativity, which changes to what we have called ""de Sitter modified general relativity"". In this paper, the Newtonian limit of this theory is used to study the circular velocity of stars around the galactic center. It is shown that the de Sitter modified Newtonian force---part of which becomes effective only in the Keplerian region of the galaxy---could possibly explain the flat rotation curve of galaxies without necessity of supposing the existence of dark matter.",1
82042,2,"Electromagnetic radiation of charged particles in stochastic motion The study of the Brownian motion of a charged particle in electric and magnetic fields has many important applications in plasma and heavy ions physics, as well as in astrophysics.

We describe the motion of the charged particle by a Langevin and generalized Langevin type stochastic differential equation. We investigate in detail the cases of the Brownian motion with or without memory in a constant electric field, in the presence of an external harmonic potential, and of a constant magnetic field. In all cases the corresponding Langevin equations are solved numerically, and a full description of the spectrum of the emitted radiation and of the physical properties of the motion is obtained.

Using the Shapiro delay for this system, we find a pulsar mass m ( )p( ) = 1.76 ± 0.06 M (⊙) and a WD mass m ( )c( ) = 1.293 ± 0.025 M (⊙). We also measure the rate of advance of periastron for this system, which is marginally consistent with the general relativity prediction for these masses. The short lifetime of the massive WD progenitor star led to a rapid X-ray binary phase with little (< 10(−)(2) M (⊙)) mass accretion onto the neutron star, hence, the current pulsar mass is, within uncertainties, its birth mass, which is the largest measured to date. We discuss the discrepancy with previous mass measurements for this system, we conclude that the measurements presented here are likely to be more accurate. Finally, we highlight the usefulness of this system for testing alternative theories of gravity by tightly constraining the presence of dipolar radiation. This is of particular importance for certain aspects of strong-field gravity, like spontaneous scalarization, since the mass of PSR J2222−0137 puts that system into a poorly tested parameter range.",1
82200,2,"Gravitational lensing in an exotic spacetime The gravitational lensing effects in the weak gravitational field by exotic lenses have been investigated to probe non-luminous exotic objects. Gravitational lenses in a strong gravitational field also are important since they are one of tests for general relativity, black holes and exotic objects. For instance, it is known that the light rays passing just outside the photon sphere make faint images in the Schwarzschild spacetime and in wormhole spacetimes. First, We examine a gravitational lens model inspired by modified gravity theories, exotic matter and energy. We study an asymptotically flat, static and spherically symmetric spacetime that is assumed in such a way that the spacetime metric depends on the inverse distance to the power of positive n in the weak field approximation. It is shown analytically and numerically that there is a lower limit on the source angular displacement from the lens object to get demagnification. Demagnifying gravitational lenses could appear, provided the source position β and the power n satisfy β > 2/(n + 1) in the units of the Einstein ring radius under a large n approximation. Unusually, the total amplification of the lensed images, though they are caused by the gravitational pull, could be less than the unity. Therefore, time-symmetric demagnification parts in numerical light curves by gravitational microlensing (Abe, Astrophys. J. 725, 787, 2010) may be an evidence of an Ellis wormhole (being an example of traversable wormholes) but they do not always prove it. Such a gravitational demagnification of the light might be used for hunting a clue of exotic matter and energy that are described by an equation of state more general than the Ellis wormhole case. Numerical calculations for n = 3 and 10 cases show maximally ∼ 10 and ∼ 60 percent depletion of the light, when the source position is β ∼ 1.1 and β ∼ 0.7, respectively. Next, we consider gravitational lensing shear by the demagnifying lens models and other models such as negative-mass compact objects causing the gravitational repulsion on light rays like a concave lens. It is shown that images by the lens models for the gravitational pull are tangentially elongated, whereas those by the repulsive ones are radially distorted. This feature of lensed image shapes may be used for searching (or constraining) localized exotic matter or energy with gravitational lensing surveys. It is suggested also that an underdense region such as a cosmic void might produce radially elongated images of background galaxies rather than tangential ones. Next we consider microlensed image centroid motions by the exotic lens models. Numerical calculations show that, for large n cases in the convextype models, the centroid shift from the source position might move on a multiply-connected curve like a bow tie, while it is known to move on an ellipse for n = 1 case and to move on an oval curve for n = 2. The distinctive feature of the microlensed image centroid may be used for searching (or constraining) localized exotic matter or energy with astrometric observations. It is shown also that the centroid shift trajectory for concave-type repulsive models might be elongated vertically to the source motion direction like a prolate spheroid, whereas that for convex-type models such as the Schwarzschild one is tangentially elongated like an oblate spheroid. Finally, we investigate the gravitational lensing effects in the Tangherlini spacetime in the weak gravitational field and the strong field limit. The gravitational lens model in the Tangherlini spacetime would work as a widerange toy model for exotic lens models with the photon sphere since it is the all-dimensional solution of the Einstein equation. We study the deflection angle of the light and the magnifications of images in the weak approximation and in the strong field limit. We derive the divergent part of the deflection angle in all dimensions and the regular part of the deflection angle in 4, 5 and 7 dimensions in the strong field limit, the deflection angle in all dimensions under the weak gravitational approximation and the relation between the size of the Einstein ring and the ones of the rings in the strong gravitational field. We also show that the images in the strong gravitational field are always fainter than the images in the weak gravitational field. We conclude that the images in the strong gravitational field have little effect on the total light curve and that the characteristic demagnification of the light curve will appear after considering the images in the strong gravitational field in higher dimensions. The gravitational lensing in the strong field limit in higher dimension would be related to the nature of the higher dimensional black hole.",1
82213,2,"Orthogonality catastrophe and fractional exclusion statistics We show that the N-particle Sutherland model with inverse-square and harmonic interactions exhibits orthogonality catastrophe. For a fixed value of the harmonic coupling, the overlap of the N-body ground state wave functions with two different values of the inverse-square interaction term goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit. When the two values of the inverse-square coupling differ by an infinitesimal amount, the wave function overlap shows an exponential suppression. This is qualitatively different from the usual power law suppression observed in the Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe. We also obtain an analytic expression for the wave function overlaps for an arbitrary set of couplings, whose properties are analyzed numerically. The quasiparticles constituting the ground state wave functions of the Sutherland model are known to obey fractional exclusion statistics. Our analysis indicates that the orthogonality catastrophe may be valid in systems with more general kinds of statistics than just the fermionic type.",1
82309,2,"Dynamic zero modes of Dirac fermions and competing singlet phases of antiferromagnetic order In quantum spin systems, singlet phases often develop in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic order. Typical settings for such problems arise when itinerant fermions are also present. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for addressing such competing orders in an itinerant system, described by Dirac fermions strongly coupled to an O(3) nonlinear sigma model. We focus on two spatial dimensions, where upon disordering the antiferromagnetic order by quantum fluctuations the singular tunneling events also known as (anti)hedgehogs can nucleate competing singlet orders in the paramagnetic phase. In the presence of an isolated hedgehog configuration of the nonlinear sigma model field, we show that the fermion determinant vanishes as the dynamic Euclidean Dirac operator supports fermion zero modes of definite chirality. This provides a topological mechanism for suppressing the tunneling events. Using the methodology of quantum chromodynamics, we evaluate the fermion determinant in the close proximity of magnetic quantum phase transition, when the antiferromagnetic order-parameter field can be described by a dilute gas of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs. We show how the precise nature of emergent singlet order is determined by the overlap between dynamic fermion zero modes of opposite chirality, localized on the hedgehogs and antihedgehogs. For a Kondo-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate the competition between spin Peierls order and Kondo singlet formation, thereby elucidating its global phase diagram. We also discuss other physical problems that can be addressed within this general framework.",1

The critical densities and proton fractions are more sensitive to the symmetry energy slope parameter at temperatures much below its critical value (Tc∼14−16MeV). The spread in the critical proton fraction at a given symmetry energy slope parameter is noticeably larger near Tc, indicating that the equation of state of warm asymmetric nuclear matter at subsaturation densities is not sufficiently constrained.

82606,2,"Intrinsic time in Geometrodynamics: introduction and application to Friedmann cosmology An intrinsic local time in Geometrodynamics is obtained with using a scaled Dirac's mapping. By addition of a background metric, one can construct a scalar field. It is suitable to play a role of intrinsic time. Cauchy problem was successfully solved in conformal variables because they are physical ones. First, the intrinsic time as a logarithm of determinant of spatial metric, was applied to a cosmological problem by Misner. A global time is exist under condition of constant mean curvature slicing of spacetime. A volume of hypersurface and the so-called mean York's time are canonical conjugated pair. So, the volume is the intrinsic global time by its sense. The experimentally observed redshift in cosmology is the evidence of its existence. An intrinsic time of homogeneous models is global. The Friedmann equation by its sense ties time intervals. Exact solutions of the Friedmann equation in Standard cosmology with standard and conformal units are presented. Theoretical curves interpolated the Hubble diagram on latest supernovae are expressed in analytical form.

The correction of the NCSG solution to Einstein's general relativity (GR) in the four-dimensional spacetime can be characterized by a parameter $\beta\sim 1/\sqrt{f_{0}}$ , where $ f_{0}$ denotes the coupling constants at the unification. The parameter $ \beta$ contributes a Yukawa-type correction $\mathrm{exp}(-\beta r)/r$ to the Newtonian gravitational potential at the leading order, which can be interpreted as either the massive component of the gravitational field or the typical range of interactions carried by that component of the field. As an extension of previous works, we mainly focus on the Solar System and stellar tests of the theory, and the constraints on $\beta$ obtained by the present work is independent of the previous ones. In the Solar System, we investigate the effects of the NCSG on the perihelion shift of a planet, deflection of light, time delay at superior conjunction (SC) and inferior conjunction (IC), and the Cassini experiment by modeling new observational results and adopting new datasets. In the binary pulsars system, based on the observational data sets of four systems of binary pulsars, PSR B1913+16, PSR B1534+12, PSR J0737-3039, and PSR B2127+11C, the secular periastron precessions are used to constrain this theory. These effects in the scale of the Solar System and binary pulsars were not considered in previous works. We find that the lower bounds given by these experiments are $\beta \simeq 10^{-9} \sim 10^{-10}$ m$^{-1}$, considerably smaller than those obtained in laboratory experiments. This confirms that experiments and observations at smaller scales are more favorable for testing the NCSG theory.",1
82922,2,"On the origin of the flux ratio anomaly in quadruple lens systems We explore the origin of the flux ratio anomaly in quadruple lens systems. Using a semi-analytic method based on N-body simulations, we estimate the effect of a possible magnification perturbation caused by subhaloes with a mass scale of ≲10^9 h^−1 M_⊙ in lensing galaxy haloes. Taking into account astrometric shifts and assuming that the primary lens is described by a singular isothermal ellipsoid, the expected change to the flux ratios for a multiply lensed image is just a few per cent and the mean of the expected convergence perturbation at the effective Einstein radius of the lensing galaxy halo is 〈δκ_sub〉 = 0.003, corresponding to the mean of the ratio of a projected dark matter mass fraction in subhaloes at the effective Einstein radius 〈f_sub〉 = 0.006. In contrast, the expected change to the flux ratio caused by line-of-sight structures is typically ∼10 per cent and the mean of the convergence perturbation is 〈|δκ_los|〉 = 0.008, corresponding to 〈f_los〉 = 0.017. The contribution of the magnification perturbation caused by subhaloes is ∼40 per cent of the total at a source redshift z_S = 0.7 and decreases monotonically in z_S to ∼20 per cent at z_S = 3.6. Assuming statistical isotropy, the convergence perturbation estimated from 11 observed quadruple lens systems has a positive correlation with the source redshift z_S, which is much stronger than that with the lens redshift z_L. This feature also supports that the flux ratio anomaly is caused mainly by line-of-sight structures rather than subhaloes. We also discuss a possible imprint of line-of-sight structures in the demagnification of minimum images due to locally underdense structures in the line of sight.",1

83020,2,"The Chern–Simons current in time series of knots and links in proteins A superspace model of knots and links for DNA time series data is proposed to take into account the feedback loop from docking to undocking state of protein–protein interactions. In particular, the direction of interactions between the 8 hidden states of DNA is considered. It is a E8×E8 unified spin model where the genotype, from active and inactive side of DNA time data series, can be considered for any living organism. The mathematical model is borrowed from loop-quantum gravity and adapted to biology. It is used to derive equations for gene expression describing transitions from ground to excited states, and for the 8 coupling states between geneon and anti-geneon transposon and retrotransposon in trash DNA. Specifically, we adopt a modified Grothendieck cohomology and a modified Khovanov cohomology for biology. The result is a Chern–Simons current in (8+3) extradimensions of a given unoriented supermanifold with ghost fields of protein structures. The 8 dimensions come from the 8 hidden states of spinor field of genetic code. The extradimensions come from the 3 types of principle fiber bundle in the secondary protein.",1
83039,2,"eLISA Telescope In-field Pointing and Scattered Light Study The orbital motion of the three spacecraft that make up the eLISA Observatory constellation causes long-arm line of sight variations of approximately ± one degree over the course of a year. The baseline solution is to package the telescope, the optical bench, and the gravitational reference sensor (GRS) into an optical assembly at each end of the measurement arm, and then to articulate the assembly. An optical phase reference is exchanged between the moving optical benches with a single mode optical fiber (“backlink” fiber). An alternative solution, referred to as in-field pointing, embeds a steering mirror into the optical design, fixing the optical benches and eliminating the backlink fiber, but requiring the additional complication of a two-stage optical design for the telescope. We examine the impact of an in-field pointing design on the scattered light performance.",1
83060,2,"Electrodynamics and spacetime geometry: Astrophysical applications After a brief review of the foundations of (pre-metric) electromagnetism, we explore some physical consequences of electrodynamics in curved spacetime. In general, new electromagnetic couplings and related phenomena are induced by the spacetime curvature. The applications of astrophysical interest considered here correspond essentially to the following geometries: the Schwarzschild spacetime and the spacetime around a rotating spherical mass in the weak field and slow rotation regime. In the latter, we use the Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. We also explore the hypothesis that the electric and magnetic properties of vacuum reflect the spacetime isometries. Therefore, the permittivity and permeability tensors should not be considered homogeneous and isotropic a priori. For spherical geometries we consider the effect of relaxing the homogeneity assumption in the constitutive relations between the fields and excitations. This affects the generalized Gauss and Maxwell-Ampère laws, where the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in vacuum depend on the radial coordinate in accordance with the local isometries of space. For the axially symmetric geometries we relax both the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy. We explore simple solutions and discuss the physical implications related to different phenomena, such as the decay of electromagnetic fields in the presence of gravity, magnetic terms in Gauss law due to the gravitomagnetism of the spacetime around rotating objects, a frame-dragging effect on electric fields and the possibility of a spatial (radial) variability of the velocity of light in vacuum around spherical astrophysical objects for strong gravitational fields.",1
83061,2,"New beam-tracking simulation code using bulk-to-point calculation technique for space charge fields A new two-dimensional beam-tracking simulation code for electron injectors using a bulk-to-point calculation technique for space charge fields was developed. The calculated space charge fields are produced not by a point charge but by a hollow cylinder that has a volume. Each tracked electron is a point charge. This bulk-to-point calculation technique for space charge fields is based on that used in the multiple beam envelope equations, which were developed by the author. The multiple beam envelope equations are a set of differential equations for investigating the beam dynamics of electron injectors and can be used to calculate bunched beam dynamics with high accuracy. However, there is one limitation. The bunched beam is assumed to be an ensemble of several segmentation pieces in both the transverse and longitudinal directions. In this bunch model, each longitudinal segmentation slice in a bunch must not warp; consequently, the accuracy of the calculated emittance is reduced in the case of a highly charged beam for calculations of a typical rf gun injector system. This limitation is related to the calculation model of longitudinal space charge fields. In the newly developed beam-tracking simulation code, the space charge field calculation scheme is upgraded and the limitation has been overcome. Therefore, the applicable range is extended while maintaining the high accuracy of emittance calculations. Simultaneously, the calculation time is markedly shortened because the emittance dependence on the segmentation number is extremely weak. In this paper, several examples of beam dynamics that cannot be calculated accurately using the multiple beam envelope equations are demonstrated using the new beam-tracking simulation code. The accuracy of the calculated emittance is also discussed.",1
83080,2,"Progress of Gas-Filled Multi-RF-Cavity Beam Profile Monitor for Intense Neutrino Beams A novel pressurized gas-filled multi-RF-cavity beam profile monitor has been studied that is simple and robust in high-radiation environments. Charged particles passing through each RF-cavity in the monitor produce intensity-dependent ionized plasma, which changes the gas permittivity. The sensitivity to beam intensity is adjustable using gas pressure and RF gradient. The performance of the gas-filled beam profile monitor has been numerically simulated to evaluate the sensitivity of permittivity measurements. The result indicates that the RF resonator will be useful to measure the beam profile with a charged beam intensity range from 10⁶ to 10¹³ protons/bunch. The range covers the expected beam intensities in NuMI and LBNF. The demonstration of the monitor with intense proton beams are taken place at Fermilab to validate the simulation result. The result will be given in this presentation.",1
83178,2,"BICEP2 / Keck Array VIII: Measurement of gravitational lensing from large-scale B-mode polarization We present measurements of polarization lensing using the 150 GHz maps, which include all data taken by the BICEP2 and Keck Array Cosmic Microwave Background polarization experiments up to and including the 2014 observing season (BK14). Despite their modest angular resolution ($\sim 0\buildrel{\circ}\over{.} 5$), the excellent sensitivity (∼3μK-arcmin) of these maps makes it possible to directly reconstruct the lensing potential using only information at larger angular scales (${\ell }\leqslant 700$). From the auto-spectrum of the reconstructed potential, we measure an amplitude of the spectrum to be ${A}_{{\rm{L}}}^{\phi \phi }=1.15\pm 0.36$ (Planck ΛCDM prediction corresponds to ${A}_{{\rm{L}}}^{\phi \phi }=1$) and reject the no-lensing hypothesis at $5.8\sigma $, which is the highest significance achieved to date using an EB lensing estimator. Taking the cross-spectrum of the reconstructed potential with the Planck 2015 lensing map yields ${A}_{{\rm{L}}}^{\phi \phi }=1.13\pm 0.20$. These direct measurements of ${A}_{{\rm{L}}}^{\phi \phi }$ are consistent with the ΛCDM cosmology and with that derived from the previously reported BK14 B-mode auto-spectrum (${A}_{{\rm{L}}}^{\mathrm{BB}}=1.20\pm 0.17$). We perform a series of null tests and consistency checks to show that these results are robust against systematics and are insensitive to analysis choices. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the B modes previously reported by BICEP/Keck at intermediate angular scales ($150\lesssim {\ell }\lesssim 350$) are dominated by gravitational lensing. The good agreement between the lensing amplitudes obtained from the lensing reconstruction and B-mode spectrum starts to place constraints on any alternative cosmological sources of B modes at these angular scales.",1

83427,2,"Exploring cosmic origins with CORE: $B$-mode component separation We demonstrate that, for the baseline design of the CORE satellite mission, the polarized foregrounds can be controlled at the level required to allow the detection of the primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization with the desired accuracy at both reionization and recombination scales, for tensor-to-scalar ratio values of r 5× 10−3. We consider detailed sky simulations based on state-of-the-art CMB observations that consist of CMB polarization with τ=0.055 and tensor-to-scalar values ranging from r=10−2 to 10−3, Galactic synchrotron, and thermal dust polarization with variable spectral indices over the sky, polarized anomalous microwave emission, polarized infrared and radio sources, and gravitational lensing effects. Using both parametric and blind approaches, we perform full component separation and likelihood analysis of the simulations, allowing us to quantify both uncertainties and biases on the reconstructed primordial B-modes. Under the assumption of perfect control of lensing effects, CORE would measure an unbiased estimate of r=(5 ± 0.4)× 10−3 after foreground cleaning. In the presence of both gravitational lensing effects and astrophysical foregrounds, the significance of the detection is lowered, with CORE achieving a 4σ-measurement of r=5× 10−3 after foreground cleaning and 60% delensing. For lower tensor-to-scalar ratios (r=10−3) the overall uncertainty on r is dominated by foreground residuals, not by the 40% residual of lensing cosmic variance. Moreover, the residual contribution of unprocessed polarized point-sources can be the dominant foreground contamination to primordial B-modes at this r level, even on relatively large angular scales, &ell; ~ 50. Finally, we report two sources of potential bias for the detection of the primordial B-modes by future CMB experiments: (i) the use of incorrect foreground models, e.g. a modelling error of Δβs = 0.02 on the synchrotron spectral indices may result in an excess in the recovered reionization peak corresponding to an effective Δ r > 10−3; (ii) the average of the foreground line-of-sight spectral indices by the combined effects of pixelization and beam convolution, which adds an effective curvature to the foreground spectral energy distribution and may cause spectral degeneracies with the CMB in the frequency range probed by the experiment.",1
83444,2,"Folding approach to topological orders enriched by mirror symmetry We develop a folding approach to study two-dimensional symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases with the mirror reflection symmetry. Our folding approach significantly transforms the mirror SETs, such that their properties can be conveniently studied through previously known tools: (i) it maps the nonlocal mirror symmetry to an onsite $\mathbb{Z}_2$ layer-exchange symmetry after folding the SET along the mirror axis, so that we can gauge the symmetry; (ii) it maps all mirror SET information into the boundary properties of the folded system, so that they can be studied by the anyon condensation theory---a general theory for studying gapped boundaries of topological orders; (iii) it makes the mirror anomalies explicitly exposed in the boundary properties, i.e., strictly 2D SETs and those that can only live on the surface of a 3D system can be easily distinguished through the folding approach. With the folding approach, we derive a set of physical constraints on data that describes mirror SET, namely mirror permutation and mirror symmetry fractionalization on the anyon excitations in the topological order. We conjecture that these constraints may be complete, in the sense that all solutions are realizable in physical systems. Several examples are discussed to justify this. Previously known general results on the classification and anomalies are also reproduced through our approach.",1

83653,2,"Observational constraints and differential diagnosis for cosmic evolutionary models In this paper, we have proposed a plotting method based on the "" natural plotting rule "" (NPR) which can be used to distinguish different cosmological scenarios more efficiently and obtain more useful information. By using the NPR, we have avoided the blindness to use different diagnostics when discovering that some scenarios can be hardly differentiated from each other, and develop a logical line to adopt different diagnostics. As a concrete instance, we take this method based on the NPR to distinguish several Cardassian scenarios from the base cosmology scenario, and one from the other. We place constraints on three Cardassian cosmological scenarios and their flat versions by utilizing the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, observational Hubble parameter (OHD) data-sets as well as the single data point from the newest event GW150914, and discover that our results are more stringent than previous results for constraining the cosmological parameters of the Cardassian scenarios. We find that the flat original Cardassian (FOC) and original Cardassian (OC) scenarios can only be distinguished in the plane of $\{\Omega_m,S_3^{(1)}\}$ at the present epoch, however, if applying the NPR to plot hierarchically for these Cardassian scenarios in the plane of $\{S_3^{(1)},S_4^{(1)}\}$, we can obtain more detailed information and distinguish the two scenarios better than before. More importantly, from the planes of $\{S_4,S_4^{(2)}\}$, $\{S_5^{(1)},S_5^{(2)}\}$, $\{S_3^{(2)},S_4^{(2)}\}$, $\{\Omega_m,S_3^{(1)}\}$,$\{z,\omega\}$ $\{\epsilon(z),S_3^{(1)}\}$ and $\{z,Om\}$, we dsicover that the flat modified polytropic Cardassian (FMPC) scenario can be directly removed from the possible candidates of dark energy phenomenon, since its evolutional behavior deviates from the base cosmology scenario too much.",1
83660,2,"Experimental measurement of sizes of emission sources for deuterons and α particles in O16-p collisions at 3.25AGeV/c The sizes of emission sources of deuterons and α particles were determined in minimum bias O16-p collisions at 3.25AGeV/c from the analysis of experimental one-dimensional correlation functions of these particles, based on a theoretical model assuming the simultaneous excitation and decay of sources (of identical particles), whose coordinates are distributed according to a Gaussian function. The peak was observed in the experimental correlation function of the pairs of α particles in the region of q<25MeV/c, which was deduced to be due to decays of unstable Be8 and B9 nuclei at various kinetic energies. This result does not contradict the popular assumption of other authors about the existence of the α-condensate state in the O16 nucleus since unstable Be8 and B9 nuclei themselves can probably be formed from decay of the α-condensate state of the oxygen nucleus if such a state does exist.",1

This system provides passive isolation from ground motion by a factor of about 400 in the horizontal direction at 4 Hz and in the vertical direction at 9 Hz. The presented isolation performance is measured under vacuum conditions using a combination of commercial and custom-made inertial sensors. Detailed analysis of this performance led to the design and implementation of tuned dampers to mitigate the effect of the unavoidable higher order modes of the system. These dampers reduce RMS motion substantially in the frequency range between 10 and 100 Hz in 6 degrees of freedom. The results presented here demonstrate that the AEI-SAS provides substantial passive isolation at all the fundamental mirror-suspension resonances.",1

If the beam pulse is too far off centre, or if the beam size is not correct, or if the beam density is too high, the target can be seriously damaged. We will start with a brief introduction to high-power targets and then move to a discussion of what can go wrong, and what are the risks.

Assessing convergence of the numerical data and building the error budget is currently challenging due to the low accuracy of general-relativistic hydrodynamics schemes and to the grid resolutions that can be employed in (3+1)-dimensional simulations. In this work, we explore the use of high-order weighted-essentially-nonoscillatory (WENO) schemes in neutron star merger simulations and investigate the accuracy of the waveforms obtained with such methods. We find that high-order WENO schemes can be robustly employed for simulating the inspiral-merger phase and they significantly improve the assessment of the waveform’s error budget with respect to finite-volume methods. High-order WENO schemes can be thus efficiently used for high-quality waveform production, and in future large-scale investigations of the binary parameter space.",1

83920,2,"Survival amplitude, instantaneous energy and decay rate of an unstable system: Analytical results We consider a model of a unstable state defined by the truncated Breit-Wigner energy density distribution function. An analytical form of the survival amplitude $a(t)$ of the state considered is found. Our attention is focused on the late time properties of $a(t)$ and on effects generated by the non--exponential behavior of this amplitude in the late time region: In 1957 Khalfin proved that this amplitude tends to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity more slowly than any exponential function of $t$. This effect can be described using a time-dependent decay rate $\gamma(t)$ and then the Khalfin result means that this $\gamma(t)$ is not a constant but at late times it tends to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity. It appears that the energy $E(t)$ of the unstable state behaves similarly: It tends to the minimal energy $E_{min}$ of the system as $t \to \infty$. Within the model considered we find two first leading time dependent elements of late time asymptotic expansions of $E(t)$ and $\gamma (t)$. We discuss also possible implications of such a late time asymptotic properties of $E(t)$ and $\gamma (t)$ and cases where these properties may manifest themselves.",1
84024,2,"Gauge concepts in theoretical applied physics Gauge concept evolves in the course of nearly one century from Faraday’s rather obscure electrotonic state of matter to the physically significant Yang–Mills that underpin today’s standard model. As gauge theories improve, links are established with modern observations, e.g. in the Aharonov–Bohm effect, the Pancharatnam–Berry’s phase, superconductivity, and quantum Hall effects. In this century, emergent gauge theory is formulated in numerous fields of applied physics like topological insulators, spintronics, and graphene. We will show in this paper the application of gauge theory in two particularly useful spin-based phenomena, namely the spin orbit spin torque and the spin Hall effect. These are important fields of study in the engineering community due to great commercial interest in the technology of magnetic memory (MRAM), and magnetic field sensors. Both spin orbit torque and spin Hall perform magnetic switching at low power and high speed. Furthermore, spin Hall is also a promising source of pure spin current, as well as a reliable form of detection mechanism for the magnetic state of a material.",1
84039,2,"Fourier domain gravitational waveforms for precessing eccentric binaries We build two families of inspiral waveforms for precessing binaries on eccentric orbits in the Fourier domain. To achieve this, we use a small eccentricity expansion of the waveform amplitudes in order to separate the periastron precession timescale from the orbital timescale, and use a SUA transformation to compute the Fourier transform in the presence of spin-induced precession. We show that the resulting waveforms can yield a median faithfulness above 0.992 when compared to an equivalent time domain waveform with an initial eccentricity of $e_0 \approx 0.3$. We also show that when spins are large or the accumulated number of cycles is large, using a circular waveform can potentially lead to significant biases in the recovery of the parameters, even when the system has fully circularized. This is an effect of the residual eccentricity present when the objects forming the binary have non-vanishing spin components in the orbital plane.",1

Results of resolution tests of the new reconstruction in the J-PET detector based on Monte Carlo simulations are presented, which yield a spatial resolution at the level of 2 cm (FWHM) for X and Y and at the level of 1 cm (FWHM) for Z available with the present resolution of J-PET after application of a kinematic fit.

In this paper, we adopt the effective-one-body formalism as the equation of motion, and obtain the accurately calculated gravitational waveforms by solving the Teukolsky equation using the frequency-domain method. We point out that high frequency modes of gravitational waves can be excited by large eccentricities of intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals. These high frequency modes can extend to more than 10 Hz, and enter the designed sensitive band of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We propose that such kinds of highly eccentric intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals could be feasible sources and potentially observable by the ground-based gravitational wave detectors, like the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.",1
84459,2,"The numerical approximation of nonlinear functionals and functional differential equations The fundamental importance of functional differential equations has been recognized in many areas of mathematical physics, such as fluid dynamics (Hopf characteristic functional equation), quantum field theory (Schwinger–Dyson equations) and statistical physics (equations for generating functionals and effective Fokker–Planck equations). However, no effective numerical method has yet been developed to compute their solution. The purpose of this report is to fill this gap, and provide a new perspective on the problem of approximating numerically nonlinear functionals and the solution to functional differential equations.",1
84577,2,"The gyraton solutions on generalized Melvin universe with cosmological constant We present and analyze new exact gyraton solutions of algebraic type II on generalized Melvin universe of type D which admit non-vanishing cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We show that it generalizes both, gyraton solutions on Melvin and on direct product spacetimes. When we set $\Lambda = 0$ we get solutions on Melvin spacetime and for $\Sigma = 1$ we obtain solutions on direct product spacetimes. We demonstrate that the solutions are member of the Kundt family of spacetimes as its subcases. We show that the Einstein equations reduce to a set of equations on the transverse 2-space. We also discuss the polynomial scalar invariants which are non-constant in general but constant for sub-solutions on direct product spacetimes.",1
84648,2,"Synchrotron Radiation from Instabilities in the Early Universe The post recombination era before the start of re-ionization is observationally quite challenging. Due to the low number density of charge carriers in the plasma during this period, electromagnetic signatures are difficult to predict. We discuss a scenario where charge separation instabilities are generated in a magnetized plasma in this era. Such instabilities will generate strong electric fields in the plasma. Any charged particle passing through these regions of electromagnetic fields, will emit synchrotron radiation. We calculate the strength of the electric field generated for a given magnetic field and obtain the synchrotron radiation spectrum for charged electrons moving through such electromagnetic fields. We find that the critical frequency of the emitted radiation is of the order of $10^{10}$  MHz.",1
84680,2,"Global Phase Diagram of a Dirty Weyl liquid and Emergent Superuniversality Pursuing complimentary field-theoretic and numerical methods, we here paint the global phase diagram of a three-dimensional dirty Weyl system. The generalized Harris criterion, augmented by a perturbative renormalization-group (RG) analysis shows that weak disorder is an irrelevant perturbation at the Weyl semimetal(WSM)-insulator quantum critical point (QCP). But, a metallic phase sets in through a quantum phase transition (QPT) at strong disorder across a multicritical point (MCP). The field theoretic predictions for the correlation length exponent $\nu=2$ and dynamic scaling exponent $z=5/4$ at this MCP are in good agreement with the ones extracted numerically, yielding $\nu=1.98 \pm 0.05$ and $z=1.23 \pm 0.05$, from the scaling of the average density of states (DOS). Deep inside the WSM phase, generic disorder is also an irrelevant perturbation, while a metallic phase appears at strong disorder through a QPT. We here demonstrate that in the presence of generic, but strong disorder the WSM-metal QPT is ultimately always characterized by the exponents $\nu=1$ and $z=3/2$ (to one-loop order), originating from intra-node or chiral symmetric (e.g., regular and axial potential) disorder. We here anchor such emergent chiral superuniversality through complimentary RG calculations, controlled via $\epsilon$-expansions, and numerical analysis of average DOS across WSM-metal QPT. In addition, we also discuss a subsequent QPT (at even stronger disorder) of a Weyl metal into an Anderson insulator by numerically computing the typical DOS at zero energy. The scaling behavior of various physical observables, such as residue of quasiparticle pole, dynamic conductivity, specific heat, Gr$\ddot{u}$neisen ratio, inside various phases as well as across various QPTs in the global phase diagram of a dirty Weyl liquid are discussed.",1
84706,2,"PT-Symmetry and Related Geometrical Structures In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the dynamics of closed quantum systems is described by Hamiltonians which are self-adjoint in appropriately chosen Hilbert spaces. For PT-symmetric quantum systems, the Hamiltonians are, in general, no longer self-adjoint in standard Hilbert spaces, rather they are self-adjoint in Krein spaces—Hilbert spaces endowed with indefinite metric structures. Moreover, the spectra of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians are symmetric with regard to the real axis in the spectral plane. Apart from Hamiltonians with purely real spectra, this includes also Hamiltonians whose spectra may contain sectors of pairwise complex-conjugate eigenvalues. Considering families of parameter-dependent Hamiltonians, one can arrange parameter-induced passages from sectors of purely real spectra to sectors of complex-conjugate spectral branches. Corresponding passages can be regarded as PT-phase transitions from sectors of exact PT-symmetry to sectors of spontaneously broken PT-symmetry. Approaching a PT-phase transition point, the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian tend toward their isotropic limit—an, in general, infinite-dimensional (Krein-space) generalization of the light-cone limit in Minkowski space. At a phase transition, the Hamiltonian is no longer diagonalizable, but similar to an arrangement of nontrivial Jordan-blocks. The interplay of these structures is briefly reviewed with special emphasis on the related Lie-algebraic and Lie-group aspects. With the help of Cartan-decompositions, associated hyperbolic structures and Lie-triple-systems are discussed for finite-dimensional setups as well as for their infinite-dimensional generalizations (Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) Lie groups, HS Lie algebras, HS Grassmannians). The interconnection of Krein-space structures and PT-phase transitions is demonstrated on two exactly solvable models: PT-symmetric Bose-Hubbard models and PT-symmetric plaquette arrangements.",1

84840,2,"Does gravitomagnetic monopole exist? A clue from a black hole X-ray binary The gravitomagnetic monopole is the proposed gravitational analogue of Dirac's magnetic monopole, and if detected, a new area of fundamental physics will be opened. Here we find the first observational evidence of such a monopole in the following way. Three primary methods to measure the black hole spin, based on the relativistic precession model of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-rays, broad relativistic X-ray spectral line and X-ray continuum spectrum, give significantly different spin values for the accreting black hole in GRO J1655--40. We demonstrate that the inclusion of just one additional parameter, that is the so-called NUT parameter or the gravitomagnetic monopole, can not only make the spin and other parameter values inferred from these three independent methods consistent with each other, but also make the inferred black hole mass consistent with an independently measured mass value. We argue that this evidence of the gravitomagnetic monopole in nature is not a result of fine-tuning, and hence is robust within our paradigm. Finally, our results tentatively suggest that the collapsed object in GRO J1655--40 could be a naked singularity.",1

The results show that the Schwarzschild-Harrison spacetime can be embedded in a (5+2)-dimensional flat spacetime and prove that the Unruh effect in the (5+2)-dimensional flat spacetime is equivalent to the Hawking effect in the (3+1)-dimensional original curved spacetime. We also find that compared to the Hawking temperature which is divengent at the event horizon, the local free-fall temperature in the Schwarzschild-Harrison spacetime seen by a freely-falling observer is finite.",1

The instrument obtains sensitivity to high frequency correlated signals far exceeding any previous measurement in a broad frequency band extending beyond the 3.8 MHz inverse light-crossing time of the apparatus. The dominant but uncorrelated shot noise is averaged down over 2×108 independent spectral measurements with 381 Hz frequency resolution to obtain 2.1×10-20m/Hz sensitivity to stationary signals.

84906,2,"Testing and improving shear viscous phase space correction models Comparison of hydrodynamic calculations with experimental data inevitably requires a model for converting the fluid to particles. In this work, nonlinear $2\to 2$ kinetic theory is used to assess the overall accuracy of various shear viscous fluid-to-particle conversion models, such as the quadratic Grad corrections, the Strickland-Romatschke (SR) ansatz, self-consistent shear corrections from linearized kinetic theory, and the correction from the relaxation time approach. We test how well the conversion models can reconstruct, using solely the hydrodynamic fields computed from the transport, the phase space density for a massless one-component gas undergoing a 0+1D longitudinal boost-invariant expansion with approximately constant specific shear viscosity in the range $\sim 0.03 \le \eta/s \le \sim 0.2$. In general we find that at early times the SR form is the most accurate, whereas at late times or for small $\eta/s\sim 0.05$ the self-consistent corrections from kinetic theory perform the best. In addition, we show that the reconstruction accuracy of additive shear viscous $f = f_{\rm eq} + \delta f$ models dramatically improves if one ensures, through ""exponentiation"", that $f$ is always positive. We also illustrate how even more accurate viscous $\delta f$ models can be constructed if one includes information about the past evolution of the system via the first time derivative of hydrodynamic fields. Such time derivatives are readily available in hydrodynamic simulations, though usually not included in the output.",1

In this mode, the protons and heavy-ion products are separated and measured in coincidence at two different focal planes of the SHARAQ. The ion-optical properties of the new mode were studied using a proton beam at 246 MeV, and the momentum vector was reconstructed from the parameters measured in the focal plane of the SHARAQ. In the experiment with the ( 16 O, 16 F) reaction at a beam energy of 247 MeV/u, the outgoing 15 O+ p produced by the decay of 16 F were measured in coincidence with the SHARAQ. High energy resolutions of 100 keV (FWHM) and ∼2 MeV were achieved for a relative energy of 535 keV and a 16 F kinetic energy of 3940 MeV, respectively. The mode allows a new form of missing-mass spectroscopy using a reaction probe with a particle-decay channel.",1

85226,2,"Properties of field functionals and characterization of local functionals Functionals (i.e., functions of functions) are widely used in quantum field theory and solid-state physics. In this paper, functionals are given a rigorous mathematical framework and their main properties are described. The choice of the proper space of test functions (smooth functions) and of the relevant concept of differential (Bastiani differential) are discussed. The relation between the multiple derivatives of a functional and the corresponding distributions is described in detail. It is proved that, in a neighborhood of every test function, the support of a smooth functional is uniformly compactly supported and the order of the corresponding distribution is uniformly bounded. Relying on a recent work by Dabrowski, several spaces of functionals are furnished with a complete and nuclear topology. In view of physical applications, it is shown that most formal manipulations can be given a rigorous meaning. A new concept of local functionals is proposed and two characterizations of them are given: the first one uses the additivity (or Hammerstein) property, the second one is a variant of Peetre’s theorem. Finally, the first step of a cohomological approach to quantum field theory is carried out by proving a global Poincaré lemma and defining multi-vector fields and graded functionals within our framework.",1
85406,2,"The Dark Energy Survey: Status and First results The observational results of the latest 15 to 20 years have stablished a standard model for the cosmology which has some amazing consequences. A mysterious entity, the dark energy, has been confirmed as the dominant component of the Universe, and is also responsible for its accelerated expansion. However, its physical nature remains unknown. Unveiling the nature of the dark energy is one of the main problems of cosmology. A powerful way of studying this problem is the measurement of different and complementary probes of the dark energy in very large galaxy surveys. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an optical and near infrared survey that is imaging 5000 deg 2 of the southern celestial hemisphere in five broad bandpass filters, to study the properties of this mysterious dark energy. In order to perform such a survey, a new CCD camera of 3 deg 2 field of view has been mounted on the Blanco 4m telescope at Cerro Tololo (Chile). The survey observations started in 2012, with the science verification run. DES will study the dark energy properties using four independent methods: galaxy clusters counts and distributions, weak gravitational lensing tomography, baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae Ia distances. Obtaining the four measurements from the same data set will allow a strict control of the systematic uncertainties to obtain a robust and precise determination of the cosmological parameters. Here, the first scientific results of the project, based on science verification data and related to photometric redshifts and galaxy shape measurements, are presented.",1

Optimizing the shape of these cavities is a complex and demanding process. In this paper we propose an optimization approach to minimize the ratio of peak magnetic field to the acceleration field Hpk/Eacc while keeping the ratio of peak surface electric field to the accelerating field Epk/Eacc, aperture radius and wall slope angle α at some permitted values. We show that it is possible to substantially vary the cavity geometry without violating the constraints or deteriorating the objective of the optimization. This gives us freedom in designing the geometry to overcome problems such as multipactor while maintaining the minimal Hpk/Eacc. The optimization is then performed to find a set of optimized geometries with minimum Hpk/Eacc for different β’s ranging from 0.4 to 1, different peak surface electric fields, wall slope angles and aperture radii. These data could be generally used as a suitable starting point in designing elliptic cavities.",1

85508,2,"Determination of the p-spray profile for n$^+$p silicon sensors using a MOSFET The standard technique to electrically isolate the n+ implants of segmented silicon sensors fabricated on high-ohmic p -type silicon are p+ -implants. Although the knowledge of the p+ -implant dose and of the doping profile is highly relevant for the understanding and optimisation of sensors, this information is usually not available from the vendors, and methods to obtain it are highly welcome. The paper presents methods to obtain this information from circular MOSFETs fabricated as test structures on the same wafer as the sensors. Two circular MOSFETs, one with and one without a p+ -implant under the gate, are used for this study. They were produced on Magnetic Czochralski silicon doped with ≈3.5×1012cm−2 of boron and 〈100〉 crystal orientation. The drain–source current as function of gate voltage for different back-side voltages is measured at a drain–source voltage of 50 mV in the linear MOSFET region, and the values of threshold voltage and mobility extracted using the standard MOSFET formulae. To determine the bulk doping, the implantation dose and profile from the data, two methods are used, which give compatible results. The doping profile, which varies between 3.5×1012cm−3 and 2×1015cm−3 for the MOSFET with p+ -implant, is determined down to a distance of a fraction of a μm from the Si-SiO2 interface. The method of extracting the doping profiles is verified using data from a TCAD simulation of the two MOSFETs. The details of the methods and of the problems encountered are discussed.",1
85524,2,"The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect of the large-scale structure (II): the effect of modified gravity The key to understand the nature of dark energy relies in our ability to probe the distant Universe. In this framework, the recent detection of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect signature in the cosmic microwave background obtained with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) is extremely useful since this observable is sensitive to the high-redshift diffuse plasma. We analyse a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 4 different realisations of a Hu & Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, parametrised by the values of $\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}=(0,-10^{-6},-10^{-5},-10^{-4})$, to compute the properties of the kSZ effect due to the ionized Universe and how they depend on $\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}$ and on the redshift of reionization, $z_{\rm re}$. In the standard General Relativity limit ($\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}$=0) we obtain an amplitude of the kSZ power spectrum of $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ}_{3000}=4.1\,$$\mu$K$^2$ ($z_{\rm re}$=8.8), close to the $+1\sigma$ limit of the $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ}_{3000}=(2.9\pm1.3)\,$$\mu$K$^2$ measurement by SPT. This corresponds to an upper limit on the kSZ contribute from patchy reionization of $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ,patchy}_{3000}<0.9\,$$\mu$K$^2$ (95 per cent confidence level). Modified gravity boosts the kSZ signal by about 3, 12 and 50 per cent for $\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}=(-10^{-6},-10^{-5},-10^{-4})$, respectively, with almost no dependence on the angular scale. This means that with modified gravity the limits on patchy reionization shrink significantly: for $\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}=-10^{-5}$ we obtain $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ,patchy}_{3000}<0.4\,$$\mu$K$^2$. Finally, we provide an analytical formula for the scaling of the kSZ power spectrum with $z_{\rm re}$ and $\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}$ at different multipoles: at $\ell=3000$ we obtain $\mathcal{D}^{\rm kSZ}_{3000}\propto z_{\rm re}^{0.24}\left(1+\sqrt{\left|\overline{f}_{\rm R,0}\right|}\right)^{41}$.",1

It will open a window on to the unseen first galaxies, showing us how their UV and X-ray photons drove the cosmic milestones of the epoch of reionization (EoR) and epoch of heating (EoH). To facilitate parameter inference from the 21 cm signal, we previously developed $${\scriptstyle 21}$$CMMC: a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler of 3D EoR simulations. Here, we extend $${\scriptstyle 21}$$CMMC to include simultaneous modelling of the EoH, resulting in a complete Bayesian inference framework for the astrophysics dominating the observable epochs of the cosmic 21 cm signal.

The ionization history of the Universe can be constrained to within a few percent.

85928,2,"GRB 170817A: a short GRB seen off-axis The angular distribution of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets is not yet clear. The observed luminosity of GRB 170817A is the lowest among all known short GRBs, which is best explained by the fact that our line of sight is outside of the jet opening angle, θ obs > θ j , where θ obs is the angle between our line of sight and the jet axis. As inferred by gravitational wave observations, as well as radio and X-ray afterglow modeling of GRB 170817A, it is likely that θ obs ∼ 20° – 28°. In this work, we quantitatively consider two scenarios of angular energy distribution of GRB ejecta: a top-hat jet and a structured jet with a power law index s. For the top-hat jet model, we get a large θ j (e.g., θ j > 10°), a rather high local (i.e., z < 0.01) short GRB rate ∼8–15×103, Gpc−3, yr−1 (estimated to be 90∼1850 Gpc−3, yr−1 in Fong et al.) and an extremely high E peak,0 (on-axis, rest-frame) > 7.5 × 104, keV (∼500, keV for a typical short GRB). For the structured jet model, we use θ obs to give limits on s and θj for typical on-axis luminosity of a short GRB (e.g., 1049 erg s−1 ∼ 1051 erg s−1), and a low on-axis luminosity case (e.g., 1049 erg s−1) gives more reasonable values of s. The structured jet model is more feasible for GRB 170817A than the top-hat jet model due to the rather high local short GRB rate, and the extremely high on-axis E peak,0 almost rules out the top-hat jet model. GRB 170817A is likely a low on-axis luminosity GRB (1049 erg s−1) with a structured jet.",1

This is due to electrons undergoing spin-flip transitions as they radiate γ-ray photons, preferentially spin polarizing in one direction. Spin polarization can modify the radiation reaction force on the electrons, which differs by up to 30% for opposite spin polarizations. Consequently, the polarization of the radiated γ-ray photons is also modified: the relative power radiated in the σ and π components increases and decreases by up to 30%, respectively, potentially reducing the rate of pair production in the plasma by up to 30%.",1
85939,2,"Super-Coherent Quantum Dynamics of Zero-Point Field and Superluminal Interactions in Matter We recently suggested the idea according to which inertia and matter could be ultimately originated by a superradiant phase transition of quantum vacuum or zero-point field (ZPF), including all gauge fields, occurring from the scale of elementary particles to that of macroscopic bodies. We have shown this process leads to the formation of spatial quantum domains, called “coherent domains” (CD), in which a matter-wave field oscillates in phase with a “tuning” auto-generated radiation field “condensed” from quantum vacuum. These synchronized oscillations link a very large number of elementary matter and radiation quantum oscillators belonging to the considered physical system giving rise to their collective motion in which each of them loses its physical individuality to become a part of a whole “entangled” (macroscopic) object. In this paper we’ll discuss, by considering the dynamics of coherent and incoherent quantum fluctuations occurring in a single coherent domain, the generation of the so-called “supercoherence”, namely the phenomenon consisting in the tuned quantum interaction between two or more coherent domains in matter. We’ll also prove this mechanism is able to originate a novel and so far, unrecognized type of long-range superfast synchronized interaction between material objects involving the exchange of, even superluminal, photons.",1
85963,2,Universal symmetry energy contribution to the neutron star equation of state We discuss the observation that under neutron star conditions of charge neutrality and $\beta-$equilibrium the contribution from the symmetry energy to the equation of state (EoS) follows a universal behaviour. We call this behaviour the conjecture of a Universal Symmetry Energy Contribution (USEC). We find that an USEC holds provided the density dependence of the symmetry energy $E_s(n)$ follows a behaviour that limits the proton fraction $x(n)$ to values below the threshold for the direct Urca (DU) cooling process. The absence of DU cooling in typical mass neutron stars appears to be supported by the phenomenology of neutron star cooling data and allows to constrain the behaviour of $E_s(n)$ at high densities. Two classes of symmetry energy functions are investigated more in detail to elucidate the USEC. We derive an analytic formula for the USEC to the neutron star EoS based on the result for the symmetry energy extracted from isobaric analog states of nuclei.,1

86060,2,"Constraints and prospects of the radiative gluino decay at the LHC At the end of the 8 TeV run, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have ruled out a
huge swath of parameter space in the context of Minimally Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM). These limits are however extremely model dependent and
therefore have to be treated with caution. For example, the limits on the gluino
mass using the simplified model approach have only constrained its three-body
decays. In this work we show that existing ATLAS and CMS analysis can also
constrain the radiative gluino decay mode. We derive improved mass limits,
specially the mass difference between the LSP and the gluino is small.",1
86135,2,"Breakdown of the equivalence between active gravitational mass and energy for a quantum body We determine active gravitational mass operator of the simplest composite quantum body - a hydrogen atom - within the semiclassical approach to the Einstein equation for a gravitational field. We show that the expectation value of the mass is equivalent to energy for stationary quantum states. On the other hand, it occurs that, for quantum superpositions of stationary states with constant expectation values of energy, the expectation values of the gravitational mass exhibit time-dependent oscillations. This breaks the equivalence between active gravitational mass and energy and can be observed as a macroscopic effect for a macroscopic ensemble of coherent quantum states of the atoms. The corresponding experiment could be the first direct observation of quantum effects in General Relativity.",1
86170,2,"Chaos and complexity by design We study the relationship between quantum chaos and pseudorandomness by developing probes of unitary design. A natural probe of randomness is the “frame poten-tial,” which is minimized by unitary k-designs and measures the 2-norm distance between the Haar random unitary ensemble and another ensemble. A natural probe of quantum chaos is out-of-time-order (OTO) four-point correlation functions. We show that the norm squared of a generalization of out-of-time-order 2k-point correlators is proportional to the kth frame potential, providing a quantitative connection between chaos and pseudorandomness. Additionally, we prove that these 2k-point correlators for Pauli operators completely determine the k-fold channel of an ensemble of unitary operators. Finally, we use a counting argument to obtain a lower bound on the quantum circuit complexity in terms of the frame potential. This provides a direct link between chaos, complexity, and randomness.",1
86208,2,"Degravitation, Orbital Dynamics and the Effective Barycentre In this article we present a particular theory of gravity in which Einstein's field equations are modified by promoting Newton's constant $G$ to a covariant differential operator $G_\Lambda(\Box_g)$. The general idea was obviously outlined for the first time in [13-16] and originates from the quest of finding a mechanism that is able to degravitate the vacuum energy on cosmological scales. We suggest in this manuscript a precise covariant coupling model which acts like a high-pass filter with a macroscopic distance filter scale $\sqrt{\Lambda}$. In the context of this specific theory of gravity we review some cosmological aspects before we briefly recall the effective relaxed Einstein equations outlined for the first time in [1]. We present a general procedure to determine the gravitational potentials for a far away wave zone field point. Moreover we work out the modified orbital dynamics of a binary-system as well as the effective 1.5 post-Newtonian barycentre for a generic $n$-body system. We notice that it is always possible to recover the corresponding general relativistic results in the limit of vanishing nonlocal modification parameters.",1

To estimate the systematic errors of the calculations we consider simple two-particle scattering on the lattice. Then we benchmark the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical methods by applying these to calculate fermion-dimer scattering in lattice effective field theory with and without a long-range Coulomb potential. The fermion-dimer calculations correspond to neutron-deuteron and proton-deuteron scattering in the spin-quartet channel at leading order in the pionless effective field theory.",1
86274,2,"Fixed points and flow analysis on off-equilibrium dynamics in the boson Boltzmann equation We consider fixed points of steady solutions and flow directions using the boson Boltzmann equation that is a one-dimensionally reduced kinetic equation after the angular integration. With an elastic collision integral of the two-to-two scattering process, in the dense (dilute) regime where the distribution function is large (small), the boson Boltzmann equation has approximate fixed points with a power-law spectrum in addition to the thermal distribution function. We argue that the power-law fixed point can be exact in special cases. We elaborate a graphical presentation to display evolving flow directions similarly to the renormalization group flow, which explicitly exhibits how fixed points are connected and parameter space is separated by critical lines. We discuss that such a flow diagram contains useful information on thermalization processes out of equilibrium.",1

In order to uncover the essential physics of this puzzling phenomenon without unnecessary complications, we study a simple model involving two-component fermions in one spatial dimension. We probe the interaction between two bound dimers for several different particle-particle interactions and measure an effective potential between the dimers using external point potentials which act as numerical tweezers. We find that the strength and range of the local part of the particle-particle interactions play a dominant role in shaping the interactions between the dimers and can even determine the overall sign of the effective potential.",1

This results in acceleration of the electron beam. The LSP (Large Scale Plasma) code is a particle in cell code which is applied in a novel way to model the DLA. Ultimately answers are needed to the questions: what is the acceleration gradient, how does this depend on the starting energy of the electrons and what is the current that can be accelerated through the DLA?

86397,2,"Neural Networks for Modeling and Control of Particle Accelerators Particle accelerators are host to myriad nonlinear and complex physical phenomena. They often involve a multitude of interacting systems, are subject to tight performance demands, and should be able to run for extended periods of time with minimal interruptions. Often times, traditional control techniques cannot fully meet these requirements. One promising avenue is to introduce machine learning and sophisticated control techniques inspired by artificial intelligence, particularly in light of recent theoretical and practical advances in these fields. Within machine learning and artificial intelligence, neural networks are particularly well-suited to modeling, control, and diagnostic analysis of complex, nonlinear, and time-varying systems, as well as systems with large parameter spaces. Consequently, the use of neural network-based modeling and control techniques could be of significant benefit to particle accelerators. For the same reasons, particle accelerators are also ideal test-beds for these techniques. Many early attempts to apply neural networks to particle accelerators yielded mixed results due to the relative immaturity of the technology for such tasks. The purpose of this paper is to re-introduce neural networks to the particle accelerator community and report on some work in neural network control that is being conducted as part of a dedicated collaboration between Fermilab and Colorado State University (CSU). We describe some of the challenges of particle accelerator control, highlight recent advances in neural network techniques, discuss some promising avenues for incorporating neural networks into particle accelerator control systems, and describe a neural network-based control system that is being developed for resonance control of an RF electron gun at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility, including initial experimental results from a benchmark controller.",1

As test cases, we replicate the main features of the gravitational critical behavior and the spacetime structure at null infinity using the Bondi mass and the News function. Additionally, we obtain the global energy conservation for an extreme situation, i.e. in the threshold of the black hole formation. In principle, the calibrated code can be used in conjunction with an ADM 3+1 code to confirm the critical behavior recently reported in the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field in an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime. For the scenarios studied, the fixed mesh refinement offers improved runtime and results comparable to code without mesh refinement.",1
86591,2,"Propagating Cosmic Rays with exact Solution of Fokker-Planck Equation Shortfalls in cosmic ray (CR) propagation models obscure the CR sources and acceleration mechanisms. This problem became particularly obvious after the Fermi, Pamela, and AMS-02 have discovered the electron/positron and $p/$He spectral anomalies. Most of the CR models use diffusive propagation that is inaccurate for weakly scattered energetic particles. So, some parts of the spectra affected by the heliospheric modulation, for example, cannot be interpreted. I discuss and adopt an exact solution of the Fokker-Planck equation arXiv1610.01584, which gives a complete description of a ballistic, diffusive and transdiffusive (intermediate between the first two) propagation regimes.

86659,2,"Physics of Core-Collapse Supernovae in Three Dimensions: a Sneak Preview Nonspherical mass motions are a generic feature of core-collapse supernovae, and hydrodynamic instabilities play a crucial role in the explosion mechanism. The first successful neutrino-driven explosions could be obtained with self-consistent, first-principles simulations in three spatial dimensions. But three-dimensional (3D) models tend to be less prone to explosion than the corresponding axisymmetric two-dimensional (2D) ones. The reason is that 3D turbulence leads to energy cascading from large to small spatial scales, the inverse of the 2D case, thus disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest scales. Unless the inertia to explode simply reflects a lack of sufficient resolution in relevant regions, some important component of robust and sufficiently energetic neutrino-powered explosions may still be missing. Such a deficit could be associated with progenitor properties such as rotation, magnetic fields, or precollapse perturbations, or with microphysics that could cause enhancement of neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also revealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D ones, such as spiral modes of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar lepton-number emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). Both impose time- and direction-dependent variations on the detectable neutrino signal. The understanding of these effects and of their consequences is still in its infancy.",1
86667,2,"A selection rule for transitions in PT-symmetric quantum theory Carl Bender and collaborators have developed a quantum theory governed by Hamiltonians that are PT-symmetric rather than Hermitian. To implement this theory, the inner product was redefined to guarantee positive norms of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. In the general case, which includes arbitrary time-dependence in the Hamiltonian, a modification of the Schrodinger equation is necessary as shown by Gong and Wang to conserve probability. In this paper, we derive the following selection rule: transitions induced by time dependence in a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian cannot occur between normalized states of differing PT-norm. We show three examples of this selection rule in action: two matrix models and one in the continuum.",1

Employing a Fermi-liquid description, we demonstrate the appearance of the Girvin-Macdonald-Platzman algebra and compute the dispersion relation of neutral excitations and various response functions. Our results satisfy requirements of particle-hole symmetry. We show that while the dispersion relation obtained from the modified random-phase approximation (MRPA) of the Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory is particle-hole symmetric, correlation functions obtained from this scheme are not.

86832,2,"Do We Really Understand the Cosmos? Our knowledge about the universe has increased tremendously in the last three decades or so — thanks to the progress in observations — but our understanding has improved very little. There are several fundamental questions about our universe for which we have no answers within the current, operationally very successful, approach to cosmology. Worse still, we do not even know how to address some of these issues within the conventional approach to cosmology. This fact suggests that we are missing some important theoretical ingredients in the overall description of the cosmos. I will argue that these issues — some of which are not fully appreciated or emphasized in the literature — demand a paradigm shift: We should not think of the universe as described by a specific solution to the gravitational field equations; instead, it should be treated as a special physical system governed by a different mathematical description, rooted in the quantum description of spacetime. I will outline how this can possibly be done.",1
86844,2,"A systematic literature review of Burgers’ equation with recent advances Even if numerical simulation of the Burgers’ equation is well documented in the literature, a detailed literature survey indicates that gaps still exist for comparative discussion regarding the physical and mathematical significance of the Burgers’ equation. Recently, an increasing interest has been developed within the scientific community, for studying non-linear convective–diffusive partial differential equations partly due to the tremendous improvement in computational capacity. Burgers’ equation whose exact solution is well known, is one of the famous non-linear partial differential equations which is suitable for the analysis of various important areas. A brief historical review of not only the mathematical, but also the physical significance of the solution of Burgers’ equation is presented, emphasising current research strategies, and the challenges that remain regarding the accuracy, stability and convergence of various schemes are discussed. One of the objectives of this paper is to discuss the recent developments in mathematical modelling of Burgers’ equation and thus open doors for improvement. No claim is made that the content of the paper is new. However, it is a sincere effort to outline the physical and mathematical importance of Burgers’ equation in the most simplified ways.

86899,2,"Laser acceleration The fundamental idea of Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) is re- viewed. An ultrafast intense laser pulse drives coherent wakefield with a relativistic amplitude robustly supported by the plasma. While the large amplitude of wake- fields involves collective resonant oscillations of the eigenmode of the entire plasma electrons, the wake phase velocity ∼ c and ultrafastness of the laser pulse introduce the wake stability and rigidity.

86911,2,"Beam loss caused by edge focusing of injection bump magnets and its mitigation in the 3-GeV rapid cycling synchrotron of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex In the 3-GeV rapid cycling synchrotron of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex, transverse injection painting is utilized not only to suppress space-charge induced beam loss in the low energy region but also to mitigate foil scattering beam loss during charge-exchange injection. The space-charge induced beam loss is well minimized by the combination of modest transverse painting and full longitudinal painting. But, for sufficiently mitigating the foil scattering part of beam loss, the transverse painting area has to be further expanded. However, such a wide-ranging transverse painting had not been realized until recently due to beta function beating caused by edge focusing of pulsed injection bump magnets during injection. This beta function beating additionally excites random betatron resonances through a distortion of the lattice superperiodicity, and its resultant deterioration of the betatron motion stability causes significant extra beam loss when expanding the transverse painting area. To solve this issue, we newly installed pulse-type quadrupole correctors to compensate the beta function beating. This paper presents recent experimental results on this correction scheme for suppressing the extra beam loss, while discussing the beam loss and its mitigation mechanisms with the corresponding numerical simulations.",1

We provide a broad overlook into these cosmological scenarios and several aspects of data analysis. In particular, we review a number of systematic issues of SN Ia analysis that include magnitude correction techniques, selection bias and their influence on the inferred cosmological constraints. Furthermore, we examine the isotropic and anisotropic components of the BAO data and their individual relevance for cosmological model-fitting. We extend the discussion presented in earlier works regarding the inferred dynamics of cosmic expansion and its present rate from the low-redshift data. Specifically, we discuss the cosmological constraints on the accelerated expansion and related model-selections.

87086,2,"High-density phase transition paves the way for supernova explosions of massive blue-supergiant stars Blue-supergiant stars develop into core-collapse supernovae, one of the most energetic outbursts in the universe, when all nuclear burning fuel is exhausted in the stellar core. Previous attempts failed to explain observed explosions of such stars which have a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass of 50 M$_\odot$ or more. Here we exploit the largely uncertain state of matter at high density, and connect the modeling of such stellar explosions with a first-order phase transition from nuclear matter to the quark-gluon plasma. The resulting very energetic supernova explosions yield stable remnant neutron stars with quark matter core, known as hybrid stars, of about 2 M$_\odot$ at birth. A galactic event of this kind would be observable due to the release of a second neutrino burst.

This high-quality equation of state is obtained from the virial expansion for the multicomponent particle mixtures that takes into account the hard-core repulsion between them. The considered model is in full concordance with all the known properties of normal nuclear matter, provides a high quality description of the proton flow constraints, hadron multiplicities created during the nuclear-nuclear collision experiments and equally is consistent with astrophysical data coming from neutron star observations. The analysis suggests that the best model parametrisation gives the incompressibility factor $K_{0}$, symmetry energy $J$ and symmetry energy slope $L$ at normal nuclear density equal to 200 MeV, 30 MeV, and 113.28-114.91 MeV, respectively.

87394,2,"Gain and time resolution of 45 $\mu$m thin Low Gain Avalanche Detectors before and after irradiation up to a fluence of $10^{15}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$ Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are silicon sensors with a built-in charge multiplication layer providing a gain of typically 10 to 50. Due to the combination of high signal-to-noise ratio and short rise time, thin LGADs provide good time resolutions. LGADs with an active thickness of about 45 μm were produced at CNM Barcelona. Their gains and time resolutions were studied in beam tests for two different multiplication layer implantation doses, as well as before and after irradiation with neutrons up to 10(15) n(eq)/cm(2). The gain showed the expected decrease at a fixed voltage for a lower initial implantation dose, as well as for a higher fluence due to effective acceptor removal in the multiplication layer. Time resolutions below 30 ps were obtained at the highest applied voltages for both implantation doses before irradiation. Also after an intermediate fluence of 3×10(14) n(eq)/cm(2), similar values were measured since a higher applicable reverse bias voltage could recover most of the pre-irradiation gain. At 10(15) n(eq)/cm(2), the time resolution at the maximum applicable voltage of 620 V during the beam test was measured to be 57 ps since the voltage stability was not good enough to compensate for the gain layer loss. The time resolutions were found to follow approximately a universal function of gain for all implantation doses and fluences.",1
87410,2,"Variation of $T_c$, lattice parameter and atomic ordering in $Nb_3Sn$ platelets irradiated with 12 MeV protons: correlation with the number of induced Frenkel defects $Nb_3Sn$ platelets with thicknesses between 0.12 and 0.20 mm produced by a high isostatic pressure process at 1250 °C were irradiated at 300 K with 12 MeV protons. The effects of irradiation on the lattice parameter a, the atomic order parameter S and the transition temperature $T_c$ were measured as a function of proton fluence. In view of the presence of multiple energy radiation sources in future accelerators, the present proton data are compared with neutron irradiation data from the literature. The fluences for both types of radiation were replaced by the dpa number, the 'displacements per atom', calculated using the FLUKA code, which is proportional to the number of radiation induced Frenkel defects. It was found that the variation of both a and S for $Nb_3Sn$ after proton and neutron irradiation as a function of dpa fall almost on the same curve, in analogy to the recently reported correlation between T c and the dpa number. By a simultaneous irradiation of two adjacent thin $Nb_3Sn$ platelets, we have shown that this correlation is not only valid for the state of 'steady energy loss' (protons traveling through the first platelet) but also for the state of higher damage at the Bragg peak (second platelet). It follows that the number of radiation induced Frenkel defects in the A15 grains, calculated via the dpa number, can be considered as a 'universal' parameter, allowing the calculation of the variation of $T_c$, a and S of $Nb_3Sn$ under the effect of multiple high energy radiation sources, as in future superconducting accelerators.",1
87447,2,"Experimental Results of a Compact Laserwire System for Non-Invasive H⁻ Beam Profile Measurements at CERN's Linac4 A non-invasive laserwire system is being developed for quasi-continuous monitoring of the transverse profile and emittance of the final 160 MeV beam at CERN's LINAC4. As part of these developments, a compact laser-based profile monitor was recently tested during LINAC4 commissioning at beam energies of 50 MeV, 80 MeV and 10⁷ MeV. A laser with a tunable pulse width (1-300 ns) and ~200 W peak power in a surface hutch delivers light via a 75 m LMA transport fibre to the accelerator. Automated scanning optics deliver a free space <150 micron width laserwire to the interaction chamber, where a transverse slice of the hydrogen ion beam is neutralised via photo-detachment. The liberated electrons are deflected by a low field dipole and captured by a sCVD diamond detector, that can be scanned in synchronisation with the laserwire position. The laserwire profile of the LINAC4 beam has been measured at all commissioning energies and is found in very good agreement with interpolated profiles from conventional SEM-grid and wire scanner measurements, positioned up and downstream of the laserwire setup. Improvements based on these prototype tests for the design of the final system are presented.",1

87543,2,"Relativistic Effects and Three-Nucleon Forces in Nuclear Matter and Nuclei We review a large body of predictions obtained within the framework of relativistic meson theory together with the Dirac–Brueckner–Hartree–Fock approach to nuclear matter and finite nuclei. The success of this method has been largely related to its ability to take into account important three-body effects. Therefore, the overarching theme of this paper is the interpretation of the so-called “Dirac effects” as an effective three-nucleon force. We address the equation of state (EoS) of isospin symmetric and asymmetric nucleonic matter and related issues, ranging from proton and neutron density distributions to momentum distributions and short-range correlations. A central part of the discussion is devoted to the optical model potential for nucleon–nucleus scattering. We also take the opportunity to explore similarities and differences with predictions based on the increasingly popular chiral effective field theory.",1
87628,2,"Constraining the nature of dark matter with the star formation history of the faintest Local Group dwarf galaxy satellites Λ warm dark matter (ΛWDM), realized by collisionless particles of 1–3 keV, has been proposed as an alternative scenario to Λ-Cold-Dark Matter (ΛCDM) for the dwarf galaxy scale discrepancies. We present an approach to test the viability of such WDM models using star-formation histories (SFHs) of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Local Group. We compare their high-time-resolution SFHs with the collapse redshift of their dark halos in CDM and WDM. Collapse redshift is inferred after determining the subhalo infall mass. This is based on the dwarf current mass inferred from stellar kinematics, combined with cosmological simulation results on subhalo evolution. WDM subhalos close to the filtering mass scale, forming significantly later than CDM, are the most difficult to reconcile with early truncation of star formation (z ≥ 3). The ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) provide the most stringent constraints. Using six UFDs and eight classical dSphs, we show that a 1 keV particle is strongly disfavored, consistently with other reported methods. Excluding other models is only hinted for a few UFDs. Other UFDs for which the lack of robust constraints on halo mass prevents us from carrying out our analysis rigorously, show a very early onset of star formation that will strengthen the constraints delivered by our method in the future. We discuss the various caveats, notably the low number of dwarfs with accurately determined SFHs and the uncertainties when determining the subhalo infall mass, most notably the baryonic physics. Our preliminary analysis may serve as a pathfinder for future investigations that will combine accurate SFHs for local dwarfs with direct analysis of WDM simulations with baryons.",1
87635,2,"The effect of a longitudinal density gradient on electron plasma wake field acceleration Three-dimensional, particle-in-cell, fully electromagnetic simulations of electron plasma wake field acceleration in the blow-out regime are presented. Earlier results are extended by (i) studying the effect of a longitudinal density gradient, (ii) avoiding the use of a co-moving simulation box, (iii) inclusion of ion motion, and (iv) studying fully electromagnetic plasma wake fields. It is established that injecting driving and trailing electron bunches into a positive density gradient of 10-fold increasing density over 10 cm long lithium vapour plasma results in spatially more compact and three times larger, compared with the uniform density case, electric fields (−6.4×1010 V m−1), leading to acceleration of the trailing bunch up to 24.4 GeV (starting from an initial 20.4 GeV), with energy transfer efficiencies from the leading to trailing bunch of 75%. In the uniform density case, a −2.5×1010 V m−1 wake is created leading to acceleration of the trailing bunch up to 22.4 GeV, with energy transfer efficiencies of 65%. It is also established that injecting the electron bunches into a negative density gradient of 10-fold decreasing density over 10 cm long plasma results in spatially more spread and two and a half smaller electric fields (−1.0×1010 V m−1), leading to a weaker acceleration of the trailing bunch up to 21.4 GeV, with energy transfer efficiencies of 45%. Taking ion motions into consideration shows that in the plasma wake ion number density can increase over a few times the background value. It is also shown that transverse electromagnetic fields in a plasma wake are of the same order as the longitudinal (electrostatic) ones.",1
87642,2,"Simple digital phase-measuring algorithm for low-noise heterodyne interferometry We present a digital algorithm for measuring the phase of a sinusoidal signal that combines the modified digital fringe-counting method with two-sample zero crossing to enable sequential signal processing. This technique can be applied to a phase meter for measuring dynamic phase differences between two sinusoidal signals with high resolution, particularly for heterodyne interferometry. The floor noise obtained from a demonstration with an electrical apparatus is $5\times {{10}^{-8}}\,\text{rad}\text{/}{{\sqrt{\text{Hz}}}^{{}}}$ at frequencies above approximately 0.1 Hz for 80 kHz signal frequency. In addition, by applying this method to a commercial heterodyne interferometer with a modulation frequency of 80 MHz, the floor-noise level is confirmed to be $7\times {{10}^{-14}}\text{m}\text{/}{{\sqrt{\text{Hz}}}^{{}}}$ from 4 kHz to 1 MHz.

87664,2,"A second decoupling between merging binary black holes and the inner disc – impact on the electromagnetic counterpart The coalescence of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) produces powerful gravitational wave radiation and, if gas is present in the vicinity, also an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. In the standard picture, an EM outburst will be produced when the binary ‘decouples’ from the circum-binary disc and starts ‘squeezing’ the disc inside the secondary orbit, resulting in its quick accretion on to the primary black hole. Here, we use analytical arguments and numerical simulations to show that the disc within about 20  of an SMBH survives the merger without being depleted. The reason is a ‘second decoupling’: the inner disc thickens due to tidal heating and inefficient cooling, effectively decoupling from the interaction of the binary. We show that this second decoupling quenches the heating sources in the disc $${\cal O}(10^2)$$ d before coalescence. This will render the peak UV/X-ray luminosity significantly weaker than previously thought. After the merger, the residual disc cools down and expands, merging with the outer disc rather than being completely accreted. This results in continuous EM emission, hindering the detection of the cut-off and re-brightening proposed in earlier studies.",1

Both the amplitude and time distributions of the PMT signals are well described by the Gaussian function. It turned out that the amplitude resolution σ(А)/А weakly depends on the type of scintillator and the proton position along the counter, and lies in the interval between 4 and 5%. The best time resolution σ(T) is about 50 ps near the counter ends and 63 ps at the center.",1
87745,2,"Torsion Effects and LLG Equation Based on the non-relativistic regime of the Dirac equation coupled to a torsion pseudo-vector, we study the dynamics of magnetization and how it is affected by the presence of torsion. We consider that torsion interacting terms in Dirac equation appear in two ways one of these is thhrough the covariant derivative considering the spin connection and gauge magnetic field and the other is through a non-minimal spin torsion coupling. We show within this framework, that it is possible to obtain the most general Landau, Lifshitz and Gilbert (LLG) equation including the torsion effects, where we refer to torsion as a geometric field playing an important role in the spin coupling process. We show that the torsion terms can give us two important landscapes in the magnetization dynamics: one of them related with damping and the other related with the screw dislocation that give us a global effect like a helix damping sharped. These terms are responsible for changes in the magnetization precession dynamics.",1
87752,2,"Hidden Photon Compton and Bremsstrahlung in White Dwarf Anomalous Cooling and Luminosity Functions We computed the contribution of the Compton and Bremsstrahlung processes with a hidden light $U(1)_D$ neutral boson $\gamma_D$ to the white dwarf G117-B15A anomalous cooling rate, as well as the white dwarf luminosity functions (WDLF). We demonstrated that for a light mass of hidden photon ($m_{\gamma_D} \ll$ a few keV), compatible results are obtained for the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey observation, but the stringent limits would be imposed on the kinetic mixing $\epsilon$. We performed $\chi^2$-tests to acquire a quantitative assessment on the WDLF data in the context of our model, computed under the assumption of different kinetic mixing $\epsilon$, the age of the oldest computed stars $T_D$, and a constant star formation rate $\psi$. Then taken together, the WDLF analysis of 2$\sigma$ confidence interval $\epsilon = \left( 0.37^{+0.35}_{-0.37}\right) \times 10^{-14}$ is barely consistent with the cooling rate analysis at 2$\sigma$ regime $\epsilon = \left( 0.97^{+0.35}_{-0.37} \right) \times 10^{-14}$. The two approaches used here agree with each other in yielding an anomalous cooling rate of white dwarf in this luminosity range.",1
87804,2,Measuring Muon-Induced Fast Neutrons at the Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope A technique to estimation low intensity muon-induced fast neutrons has been developed. The procedure for data analysis and interpretation of the results are discussed. The technique has been applied to estimate the neutron background from rock at the Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope (BUST). A neutron background measurement relies on the production of a cosmogenic nuclide (12) B by fast neutrons in an organic scintillator. The method exploited the delayed coincidences between the (12) B production signals and electrons from (12) B β (−)-decay. The total flux of muon-induced neutrons from rock was determined to be Φ (n) = (21.5 ± 5) · 10(−)(9) cm (−)(2) s (−)(1). The estimated full fluxes of neutrons agree with results of Monte-Carlo simulations.,1

In the particular form, Bethe vectors admit the recurrent procedure, with an appropriate modification, used previously in the case of the XXX Heisenberg chain. As expected, these Bethe vectors yield the strikingly simple expression for the off-shell action of the transfer matrix of the chain as well as the spectrum of the transfer matrix and the corresponding Bethe equations.

87898,2,"Perturbation theory for arbitrary coupling strength? We present a new formulation of perturbation theory for quantum systems, designated here as: “mean field perturbation theory” (MFPT), which is free from power-series-expansion in any physical parameter, including the coupling strength. Its application is thereby extended to deal with interactions of arbitrary strength and to compute system-properties having non-analytic dependence on the coupling, thus overcoming the primary limitations of the “standard formulation of perturbation theory” (SFPT). MFPT is defined by developing perturbation about a chosen input Hamiltonian, which is exactly solvable but which acquires the nonlinearity and the analytic structure (in the coupling strength) of the original interaction through a self-consistent, feedback mechanism. We demonstrate Borel-summability of MFPT for the case of the quartic- and sextic-anharmonic oscillators and the quartic double-well oscillator (QDWO) by obtaining uniformly accurate results for the ground state of the above systems for arbitrary physical values of the coupling strength. The results obtained for the QDWO may be of particular significance since “renormalon”-free, unambiguous results are achieved for its spectrum in contrast to the well-known failure of SFPT in this case.",1

A very intense deuteron beam and a spectrometer with a large angular acceptance let us achieve a potential of discovery, which includes the capability of determining the angle-dependent cross sections with high statistics. The 2p state in a Sn nucleus was observed for the first time. The binding energies and widths of the pionic states are determined and found to be consistent with previous experimental results of other Sn isotopes. The spectrum is measured at finite reaction angles for the first time. The formation cross sections at the reaction angles between 0° and 2° are determined. The observed reaction-angle dependence of each state is reproduced by theoretical calculations. However, the quantitative comparison with our high-precision data reveals a significant discrepancy between the measured and calculated formation cross sections of the pionic 1s state.",1
87927,2,"Testing the variability of the proton-to-electron mass ratio from observations of methanol in the dark cloud core L1498 The dependence of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, μ, on the local matter density was investigated using methanol emission in the dense dark cloud core L1498. Towards two different positions in L1498, five methanol transitions were detected and an extra line was tentatively detected at a lower confidence level in one of the positions. The observed centroid frequencies were then compared with their rest-frame frequencies derived from least-squares fitting to a large data set. Systematic effects, as the underlying methanol hyperfine structure and the Doppler tracking of the telescope, were investigated and their effects were included in the total error budget. The comparison between the observations and the rest-frame frequencies constrains potential μ variation at the level of Δμ/μ < 6 × 10^−8, at a 3σ confidence level. For the dark cloud, we determine a total CH_3OH (A+E) beam averaged column density of ∼3–4 × 10^12 cm^−2 (within roughly a factor of two), an E- to A-type methanol column density ratio of N(A-CH_3OH)/N(E-CH_3OH) ∼1.00 ± 0.15, a density of n(H_2) = 3 × 10^5 cm^−3 (again within a factor of two) and a kinetic temperature of T_kin = 6 ± 1 K. In a kinetic model including the line intensities observed for the methanol lines, the n(H_2) density is higher and the temperature is lower than that derived in previous studies based on different molecular species; the intensity of the 1_0 → 1_−1 E line strength is not well reproduced.",1
87981,2,"The Deep and Transient Universe in the SVOM Era: New Challenges and Opportunities - Scientific prospects of the SVOM mission To take advantage of the astrophysical potential of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Chinese and French astrophysicists have engaged the SVOM mission (Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor). Major advances in GRB studies resulting from the synergy between space and ground observations, the SVOM mission implements space and ground instrumentation. The scientific objectives of the mission put a special emphasis on two categories of GRBs: very distant GRBs at z$>$5 which constitute exceptional cosmological probes, and faint/soft nearby GRBs which allow probing the nature of the progenitors and the physics at work in the explosion. These goals have a major impact on the design of the mission: the on-board hard X-ray imager is sensitive down to 4 keV and computes on line image and rate triggers, and the follow-up telescopes on the ground are sensitive in the NIR. At the beginning of the next decade, SVOM will be the main provider of GRB positions and spectral parameters on very short time scale. The SVOM instruments will operate simultaneously with a wide range of powerful astronomical devices. This rare instrumental conjunction, combined with the relevance of the scientific topics connected with GRB studies, warrants a remarkable scientific return for SVOM. In addition, the SVOM instrumentation, primarily designed for GRB studies, composes a unique multi-wavelength observatory with rapid slew capability that will find multiple applications for the whole astronomy community beyond the specific objectives linked to GRBs. This report lists the scientific themes that will benefit from observations made with SVOM, whether they are specific GRB topics, or more generally all the issues that can take advantage of the multi-wavelength capabilities of SVOM.",1
88054,2,"Modeling and Simulation of Diesel Injection at Transcritical Conditions The need for improved engine efficiencies has motivated the development of high-pressure combustion systems, in which operating conditions achieve and exceed critical conditions. Associated with these conditions are large thermodynamic gradients and strong variations in transport properties as the fluid undergoes mixing and phase transition. Accurately simulating these real-fluid environments remains a main challenge. Different modeling approaches have been employed, which can be categorized as diffused and sharp interface methods. The objective of this study is to examine the diffused interface method for simulating diesel-fuel injection at conditions related to the supercritical regime. To this end, a recently developed compressible real-fluid solver for transcritical conditions is employed. Simulations of an ECN-relevant diesel-fuel injector are performed and predictions for instantaneous and statistical flow-field results are compared against available measurements. It is expected that results from this analysis will be useful in identifying limitations of current modeling techniques and in improving physical and numerical models for high-pressure injection systems.",1
88060,2,"Revisiting Hyperbolicity of Relativistic Fluids Motivated by the desire for highly accurate numerical computations of compact binary spacetimes in the era of gravitational wave astronomy, we reexamine hyperbolicity and well-posedness of the initial value problem for popular models of general relativistic fluids. Our analysis relies heavily on the dual-frame formalism, which allows us to work in the Lagrangian frame, where computation is relatively easy, before transforming to the desired Eulerian form. This general strategy allows for the construction of compact expressions for the characteristic variables in a highly economical manner. General relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD), ideal magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (RGRMHD) are considered in turn. In the first case we obtain a simplified form of earlier expressions. In the second we show that the flux-balance law formulation used in typical numerical applications is only weakly hyperbolic and thus does not have a well-posed initial value problem. Newtonian ideal MHD is found to suffer from the same problem when written in flux-balance law form. An alternative formulation, closely related to that of Anile and Pennisi, is instead shown to be strongly hyperbolic. In the final case we find that the standard forms of RGRMHD, relying upon a particular choice of `generalized Ohm's law', are only weakly hyperbolic. The latter problem may be rectified by adjusting the choice of Ohm's law, but we do not do so here. Along the way weak hyperbolicity of the field equations for dust and charged dust is also observed. More sophisticated systems, such as multi-fluid and elastic models are also expected to be amenable to our treatment.",1
88135,2,"Transverse to longitudinal phase space coupling in an electron beam for suppression of microbunching instability The microbunching instability developed during the beam compression process in the linear accelerator (LINAC) of a free-electron laser (FEL) facility has always been a problem that degrades the lasing performance, and even no FEL is able to be produced if the beam quality is destroyed too much by the instability. A common way to suppress the microbunching instability is to introduce extra uncorrelated energy spread by the laser heater that heats the beam through the interaction between the electron and laser beam, as what has been successfully implemented in the Linac Coherent Light Source and Fermi@Elettra. In this paper, a simple and effective scheme is proposed to suppress the microbunching instability by adding two transverse gradient undulators (TGU) before and after the magnetic bunch compressor. The additional uncorrelated energy spread and the density mixing from the transverse spread brought up by the first TGU results in significant suppression of the instability. Meanwhile, the extra slice energy spread and the transverse emittance can also be effectively recovered by the second TGU. The magnitude of the suppression can be easily controlled by varying the strength of the magnetic fields of the TGUs. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique in the LINAC of an x-ray free-electron laser facility.",1
88168,2,"Relativity and Accelerator Engineering From a geometrical viewpoint, according to the theory of relativity, space and time constitute a four-dimensional continuum with pseudo-Euclidean structure. This has recently begun to be a practically important statement in accelerator physics. An X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) is in fact the best, exciting example of an engineering system where improvements in accelerator technology makes it possible to develop ultrarelativistic macroscopic objects with an internal fine structure, and the theory of relativity plays an essential role in their description. An ultrarelativistic electron bunch modulated at nanometer-scale in XFELs has indeed a macroscopic finite-size of order of 10 $\mu$m. Its internal, collective structure is characterized in terms of a wave number vector. Here we will show that a four-dimensional geometrical approach, unusual in accelerator physics, is needed to solve problems involving the emission of radiation from an ultrarelativistic modulated electron beam accelerating along a curved trajectory. We will see that relativistic kinematics enters XFEL physics in a most fundamental way through the so-called Wigner rotation of the modulation wave number vector, which is closely associated to the relativity of simultaneity. If not taken into account, relativistic kinematics effects would lead to a strong qualitative disagreement between theory and experiments. In this paper, several examples of relativistic kinematics effects, which are important for current and future XFEL operation, are studied. The theory of relativity is applied by providing details of the clock synchronization procedure within the laboratory frame. This approach, exploited here but unusual in literature, is rather ""practical"", and should be acceptable to accelerator physicists.",1

88320,2,"Simulations of the physics and electronics in 2D semiconductor pixel detectors In this thesis, simulations have been developed of entire 2D Semiconductor pixel detectors, including the physics and electronic responses. The most important concept of this is the separation of simulation into three distinct physical regimes, which should each be simulated in a different manner. The first stage is a particle level simulation of X-Ray photons and their secondary particles interacting with the detector, and recording where interactions depositing energy in the sensitive layer occur. This uses Geant4, as the energy range in use lies just within Geant4’s minimum energy bound. The second stage is a charge cloud simulation of the interaction energy conversion to electron hole pairs, and then the movement of these electrons or holes in the sensitive layer towards the collection area or pixels. This uses an analytic solution to the problem of a charge cloud moving and interacting with itself within a semiconductor, this work is based upon the earlier HORUS simulation and more detailed lattice simulations by R. F. Fowler, et al. The third stage is an electronics level simulation of how the collected charge is manipulated by the detector into a digital read out signal. This is done with a collection of functions representing the response of electronic components to a signal, that can be used in turn to represent the electronic response to an electrical signal. Work was also conducted to develop a model of simulating the charge plasma effects expected to be seen in European XFEL detectors at high charge densities, however a lack of suitable data to test or tune the model renders this a theoretical exercise. Simulations using the software have been compared to data taken with real detectors to test the accuracy of the simulation, with a focus on the charge cloud simulation. The software has been written to be adaptable so that it can simulate all three main detectors at European XFEL, this adaptability then means that it can in principle be used for any other pixel detector",1
88364,2,"Supernova-Explosion Mechanism Involving Neutrinos A major part of the energy released upon the gravitational collapse of massive-star cores is carried away by neutrinos. Neutrinos play a crucial role in collapsing supernovae (SNe). At the present time, mathematical models of core-collapse SNe are based on multidimensional gas dynamics and thermonuclear reactions, whereas the neutrino transport is frequently treated in simplified way. An accurate analysis of neutrinos in a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse is performed on the basis of Boltzmann kinetic equations including all weak-interaction reactions with exact quantum-mechanical matrix elements. The role of multidimensional effects is studied bymeans of multidimensional gas dynamics allowing for the neutrino transport via diffusion treated by employing flux limiters. The possibility of largescale convection, which is of interest both from the point of view of explaining a type II supernova (SN) and from the point of view of implementing an experiment aimed at detecting possible energetic (≳10 MeV) neutrinos from an SN, is discussed. Thermonuclear burning leads to the explosion of a type I SN. A hot central region and the subsequent large-scale convection may also play an important role in the SN mechanism. If neutrinos and convection play a key role for a type II SN, then, in order to explain gamma radiation from product radioactive elements, convection is of importance in the case of SNe belonging to both types. In addition, convection may be important for bright type I SNe. Original methods are presented for multidimensional gas dynamics involving thermonuclear burning and for multitemperature gas dynamics involving radiative transfer.",1

88425,2,Beam Confinement Dynmics in a Barrier Bucket Barrier bucket beam trapping has some history. For the first time Griffin proposed this method and demonstrated in Tevatron project in 1983*. There the barrier voltage has been generated in the way that higher harmonic components of RF voltage are superimposed. Since then several groups tried this method and it has been utilized in a routine operation of Fermilab Antiproton Recycler . The induction synchrotron concept was proposed in 2000. Barrier bucket created by the pulse voltages has been assumed for beam confinement in this accelerator. Its concept was confirmed in the experiment using the 12 GeV PS in 2006**. From the early days of barrier bucket development chaotic-like motions of trapped particles in the phase space have attracted our concerns . However there are no systematic studies focusing on this point.

We will propose what counter measures are effective in order to mitigate increasing of the longitudinal emittance caused by this instability.,1
88434,2,Symmetric-Gapped Surface States of Fractional Topological Insulators We construct the symmetric-gapped surface states of a fractional topological insulator with an electromagnetic θ angle θem=π3 and a discrete Z3 gauge field. They are the proper generalizations of the T-Pfaffian state and Pfaffian/antisemion state and feature an extended periodicity compared with their “integer” topological band insulator counterparts. We demonstrate that the surface states have the correct anomalies associated with time-reversal symmetry and charge conservation.,1
88460,2,"Self-gravitating systems of ideal gases in the 1PN approximation We obtain the Maxwell-Jüttner distribution function at first order in the post-Newtonian approximation within the framework of general relativity. Taking into account the aforesaid distribution function, we compute the particle four-flow and energy-momentum tensor. We focus on the search of static solutions for the gravitational potentials with spherical symmetry. In doing so, we obtain the density, pressure and gravitational potential energy profiles in terms of dimensionless radial coordinate by solving the aforesaid equations numerically. In particular, we find the parametric profile for the equation of state p/ρ in terms of the dimensionless radial coordinate. Due to its physical relevance, we also find the galaxy rotation curves using the post-Newtonian approximation. We join two different kinds of static solutions in order to account for the linear regime near the center and the typical flatten behavior at large radii as well.",1

It is found that the n/p ratio and the π−/π+ ratio in the central Sn132+Sn124 reaction at 300 MeV/nucleon mainly probe the symmetry energy in the density region 1–1.5 times saturation density. However, the π−/π+ ratio may be able to probe the density-dependent symmetry energy above 1.5 times saturation density by making some kinematic restrictions such as the azimuthal angle and kinetic energy cuts of emitting pions.",1
88493,2,"Elemental analysis of glass and bakelite electrodes using PIXE facility The evolution of particle detectors dates back to the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity in 1890s. In detector history, the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) are introduced in early 1980s. An RPC is a gaseous detector made up of two parallel electrodes having high resistivity like that of glass and bakelite. Currently several high energy physics experiments are using RPC-based detector system due to robustness and simplicity of construction. In each and every experiment, RPCs have to run continuously for several years. So, it demands an indepth characterization of the electrode materials. In the present study, an elemental analysis of locally available glass and bakelite samples is done using PIXE facility available at Panjab University Cyclotron, Chandigarh. PIXE measurements are done using 2.7 MeV proton beam incident on the electrode sample target. The constituent elements present in these electrode samples are reported.",1
88522,2,"Constancy of the cluster gas mass fraction in the $R_h=ct$ Universe The ratio of baryonic to dark matter densities is assumed to have remained constant throughout the formation of structure. With this, simulations show that the fraction f gas( z ) of baryonic mass to total mass in galaxy clusters should be nearly constant with redshift z . However, the measurement of these quantities depends on the angular distance to the source, which evolves with z according to the assumed background cosmology. An accurate determination of f gas( z ) for a large sample of hot ( kT e>5 keV), dynamically relaxed clusters could therefore be used as a probe of the cosmological expansion up to z <2. The fraction f gas( z ) would remain constant only when the correct cosmology is used to fit the data. In this paper, we compare the predicted gas mass fractions for both Λ cold dark matter ( Λ CDM) and the R h= ct Universe and test them against the three largest cluster samples (LaRoque et al. 2006 Astrophys.

Unlike Λ CDM, however, the R h= ct Universe has no free parameters to optimize in fitting the data. Model selection tools, such as the Akaike information criterion and the Bayes information criterion (BIC), therefore tend to favour R h= ct over Λ CDM.

We demonstrate that a cosmological inflation scenario occurs for $K=1.64 \times 10^{109}\text{N}\cdot\text{m}^{-2}$ and show that the dark energy density is decreased by a factor of $\sim 10^{122}$, while the scaling factor expands from $\sim 10^{-60}$ to $\sim 10^{-32}$ during a time of the order of $10^{-42}\text{s}$.

88633,2,"An absorption profile centred at 78 megahertz in the sky-averaged spectrum After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz1. Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars; however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions2. This discrepancy suggests that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such as radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this discrepancy; of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude3. The low-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of Lyman-α photons by 180 million years after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the radiation temperature less than 100 million years later.",1
88656,2,"Density split statistics: Cosmological constraints from counts and lensing in cells in DES Y1 and SDSS We derive cosmological constraints from the probability distribution function (PDF) of evolved large-scale matter density fluctuations. We do this by splitting lines of sight by density based on their count of tracer galaxies, and by measuring both gravitational shear around and counts-in-cells in overdense and underdense lines of sight, in Dark Energy Survey (DES) First Year and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Our analysis uses a perturbation theory model (see companion paper Friedrich at al.) and is validated using N-body simulation realizations and log-normal mocks. It allows us to constrain cosmology, bias and stochasticity of galaxies w.r.t. matter density and, in addition, the skewness of the matter density field. From a Bayesian model comparison, we find that the data weakly prefer a connection of galaxies and matter that is stochastic beyond Poisson fluctuations on <=20 arcmin angular smoothing scale. The two stochasticity models we fit yield DES constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m=0.26^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $\Omega_m=0.28^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ that are consistent with each other. These values also agree with the DES analysis of galaxy and shear two-point functions (3x2pt) that only uses second moments of the PDF. Constraints on $\sigma_8$ are model dependent ($\sigma_8=0.97^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ and $0.80^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ for the two stochasticity models), but consistent with each other and with the 3x2pt results if stochasticity is at the low end of the posterior range. As an additional test of gravity, counts and lensing in cells allow to compare the skewness $S_3$ of the matter density PDF to its LCDM prediction. We find no evidence of excess skewness in any model or data set, with better than 25 per cent relative precision in the skewness estimate from DES alone.",1

For the case of close conductors, we provide approximate expressions for that difference, by evaluating the capacitance matrix using the proximity force approximation. Since the high-temperature limit for the Casimir free energy for a medium described by a frequency-dependent conductivity diverging at zero frequency coincides with that of an isolated conductor, our results may shed light on the corrections to the Casimir force in the presence of real materials.",1

Since the spin of the Dirac field couples naturally to torsion, we generalize our analysis to the Einstein-Cartan-Dirac (ECD) equations, again recovering the schr\""odinger-Newton equation. We then consider the ECD equations with a new length scale that unifies Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius, and find a Poisson equation with a modified coupling constant, in the small mass limit.",1
88795,2,"Higgs Bosons as Probes of Nonminimal Supersymmetric Models The experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have confirmed that the
Standard Model (SM) is a good description of particle physics at the electroweak
scale. The Standard Model is still incomplete, since it does not explain e.g.
neutrino masses, dark matter, dark energy or gravity.
Supersymmetry is a well motivated way to extend the Standard Model. The
minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) has become somewhat finetuned
after the first run of the LHC and therefore the detailed study of nonminimal
supersymmetric models is highly motivated.
We studied phenomenological implications of some nonminimal supersymmetric
models especially in the light of the recent discovery of a Higgs boson.
Our studies focused on supersymmetry without R-parity and left-right symmetric
supersymmetric models.
In the MSSM a 125 GeV Higgs requires rather heavy superpartners. In
nonminimal models the Higgs mass can be lifted by contributions from new
particles at tree-level, loop-level or by mixing effects. We found that if we
introduce spontaneous R-parity violation, the mixing between the SM-like Higgs
and a right-handed sneutrino can increase the mass of the SM-like Higgs if
the sneutrino-like state is lighter than 125 GeV. One does not need as heavy
superpartners as in the MSSM and thus fine-tuning is not as severe.
If the Higgs mass gets additional contributions, the squarks of the third
generation can be more easily within the reach of the LHC. If R-parity is not
imposed, the squarks can have new decay modes, which can have a large branching
fraction. As an example we studied a model, where R-charges are identified
with the lepton number and found that the discovery potential for the t˜→ be+
mode is well beyond 1 TeV squark masses.
In left-right supersymmetry we studied the Higgs decay modes and the option
of having a right-handed sneutrino as a dark matter candidate. We found
that a loop-induced mixing of the bidoublets can either enhance or suppress the
Higgs coupling to bottom quarks and thus change the signal strengths considerably.
However, in the scan there was also a large number of points, where the
couplings behaved close to those of the SM.
The right-handed sneutrino is a part of a doublet in left-right symmetric
models. We found that sneutrinos may annihilate via a D-term coupling to the
Higgs and produce the observed relic density. If we assume the gauge coupling of
the right-handed gauge interactions to be the same as for the left-handed ones,
we were able to predict a range of masses for the sneutrino. We also showed
that with 100 fb−1 we could get a signal of superpartners from the sleptonic
decays of the right-handed WR-boson, if its mass is below 3 TeV.",1

The calculated differential cross section is symmetric with respect to both the zx- and zy-planes. The nodes whose number is identical with nx and ny appear in the energy spectrum measured in zx- and zy-planes, respectively.

88993,2,"Aspects of Gravitational Collapse and the formation of Spacetime Singularities Possibilities emerging out of the dynamical evolutions of collapsing systems are addressed in this thesis through analytical investigations of the highly non-linear Einstein Field Equations. Studies of exact solutions and their properties, play a non-trivial role in general relativity, even in the current context. Finding non-trivial solutions to the Einstein field equations requires some reduction of the problem, which usually is done by exploiting symmetries or other properties. Exact solutions of the Einsteins field equations describing an unhindered gravitational collapse are studied which generally predict an ultimate singular end-state. In the vicinity of such a spacetime singularity, the energy densities, spacetime curvatures, and all other physical quantities blow up. Despite exhaustive attempts over decades, the famous conjecture that the formation of a singularity during stellar collapse necessarily accompanies the formation of an event horizon, thereby covering the central singularity, still remains without a proof. Moreover, there are examples of stellar collapse models with reasonable matter contribution in which an event horizon does not form at all, giving rise to a naked singularity from which both matter and radiation can fall in and come out. These examples suggest that the so-called cosmic censorship conjecture may not be a general rule. Therefore one must embark upon analysis of realistic theoretical models of gravitational collapse and gradually generalizing previous efforts.",1
89014,2,"Quasi-integrable non-linear Schrödinger models, infinite towers of exactly conserved charges and bright solitons Deformations of the focusing non-linear Schrödinger model (NLS) are considered in the context of the quasi-integrability concept. We strengthen the results of JHEP 09 (2012) 103 for bright soliton collisions. We addressed the focusing NLS as a complement to the one in JHEP 03 (2016) 005 , in which the modified defocusing NLS models with dark solitons were shown to exhibit an infinite tower of exactly conserved charges. We show, by means of analytical and numerical methods, that for certain two-bright-soliton solutions, in which the modulus and phase of the complex modified NLS field exhibit even parities under a space-reflection symmetry, the first four and the sequence of even order charges are exactly conserved during the scattering process of the solitons. We perform extensive numerical simulations and consider the bright solitons with deformed potential $ V=\frac{2\eta }{2+\upepsilon}{\left({\left|\psi \right|}^2\right)}^{2+\upepsilon},\upepsilon \in \mathbb{R},\eta <0 $ . However, for two-soliton field components without definite parity we also show numerically the vanishing of the first non-trivial anomaly and the exact conservation of the relevant charge. So, the parity symmetry seems to be a sufficient but not a necessary condition for the existence of the infinite tower of conserved charges. The model supports elastic scattering of solitons for a wide range of values of the amplitudes and velocities and the set {η, ϵ}. Since the NLS equation is ubiquitous, our results may find potential applications in several areas of non-linear science.",1

In this work, we investigate the behavior of local chiral potentials at leading order under variation of the cutoff scale for different local regulators. When varying the cutoff, we require that the resulting interaction produces no spurious bound states in the deuteron channel. We find that, for a particular choice of leading-order operators, nucleon-nucleon phase shifts and the deuteron ground-state energy converge to cutoff-independent plateaus, for all regulator functions we investigate. This observation may enable improved calculations with chiral Hamiltonians that also include three-nucleon interactions.",1

We show that these orbits come in pairs, one co-rotating and one counter-rotating, at a critical radius that varies with the frequency. We derived an explicit formula for this radius in the deep water regime. Our method is validated by comparison with recent experimental data from a wavetank experiment.

The MRPC technology TOF system can be defined as three generations. The first generation TOF is based on float glass MRPC and its time resolution is around 80ps, but the rate is relatively low (typically lower than 100Hz/cm2). The typical systems are TOF of RHIC-STAR, LHC-ALICE and BES III endcap.

In this work we present a new technique called eigenvector continuation that can extend the reach of these methods. The key insight is that while an eigenvector resides in a linear space with enormous dimensions, the eigenvector trajectory generated by smooth changes of the Hamiltonian matrix is well approximated by a very low-dimensional manifold. We prove this statement using analytic function theory and propose an algorithm to solve for the extremal eigenvectors. We benchmark the method using several examples from quantum many-body theory.",1

The charge signal is read out by readout strips, separated by a thin insulating layer from the anode strips. This scheme strongly suppresses the sensitivity of the detector to discharges between the micro-mesh and the floating anode strips, induced by strongly ionizing particles.

We extend an earlier theory of topological order in insulators and metals, in which the topological order combines naturally with the breaking of these conventional discrete symmetries. We find translationally invariant states with topological order coexisting with both Ising-nematic order and spontaneous charge currents. The link between the discrete broken symmetries and the topological-order-induced pseudogap explains why the broken symmetries do not survive in the confining phases without a pseudogap at large doping. Our theory also connects to the O(3) nonlinear sigma model and CP1 descriptions of quantum fluctuations of the Néel order. In this framework, the optimal doping criticality of the cuprates is primarily associated with the loss of topological order.",1
89738,2,"Isotropy-Violation Diagnostics for $B$-mode Polarization Foregrounds to the Cosmic Microwave Background Isotropy-violation statistics can highlight polarized galactic foregrounds that contaminate primordial B-modes in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We propose a particular isotropy-violation test and apply it to polarized Planck 353 GHz data, constructing a map that indicates B-mode foreground dust power over the sky. We build our main isotropy test in harmonic space via the bipolar spherical harmonic basis, and our method helps us to identify the least-contaminated directions. By this measure, there are regions of low foreground in and around the BICEP field, near the South Galactic Pole, and in the Northern Galactic Hemisphere. There is also a possible foreground feature in the BICEP field. We compare our results to those based on the local power spectrum, which is computed on discs using a version of the method of Planck Int. XXX (2016). The discs method is closely related to our isotropy-violation diagnostic. We pay special care to the treatment of noise, including chance correlations with the foregrounds. Currently we use our isotropy tool to assess the cleanest portions of the sky, but in the future such methods will allow isotropy-based null tests for foreground contamination in maps purported to measure primordial B-modes, particularly in cases of limited frequency coverage.",1

In particular, we develop a new and simple technique, allowing one to prove the completeness of such systems.

89826,2,"Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Afterglows with Two-Component Jets: Polarization Evolution Revisited Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been widely argued to originate from binary compact object mergers or core collapses of massive stars. Jets from these systems may have two components, an inner, narrow sub-jet and an outer, wider sub-jet. Such a jet subsequently interacts with its ambient gas, leading to a reverse shock (RS) and a forward shock (FS). The magnetic field in the narrow sub-jet is very likely to be mixed by an ordered component and a random component during the afterglow phase. In this paper, we calculate light curves and polarization evolution of optical afterglows with this mixed magnetic field in the RS region of the narrow sub-jet in a two-component jet model. The resultant light curve has two peaks: an early peak arises from the narrow sub-jet and a late-time rebrightening is due to the wider sub-jet. We find the polarization degree (PD) evolution under such a mixed magnetic field confined in the shock plane is very similar to that under the purely ordered magnetic field condition. The two-dimensional `mixed' magnetic fields confined in the shock plane are essentially the ordered magnetic fields only with different configurations. The position angle (PA) of the two-component jet can change gradually or abruptly by $90^\circ$. In particular, an abrupt $90^\circ$ change of the PA occurs when the PD changes from its decline phase to rise phase.",1
89834,2,"Minimal nuclear energy density functional We present a minimal nuclear energy density functional (NEDF) called “SeaLL1” that has the smallest number of possible phenomenological parameters to date. SeaLL1 is defined by seven significant phenomenological parameters, each related to a specific nuclear property. It describes the nuclear masses of even-even nuclei with a mean energy error of 0.97MeV and a standard deviation of 1.46MeV, two-neutron and two-proton separation energies with rms errors of 0.69MeV and 0.59MeV respectively, and the charge radii of 345 even-even nuclei with a mean error εr=0.022fm and a standard deviation σr=0.025fm. SeaLL1 incorporates constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of pure neutron matter from quantum Monte Carlo calculations with chiral effective field theory two-body (NN) interactions at the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO) level and three-body (NNN) interactions at the next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO) level. Two of the seven parameters are related to the saturation density and the energy per particle of the homogeneous symmetric nuclear matter, one is related to the nuclear surface tension, two are related to the symmetry energy and its density dependence, one is related to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction, and one is the coupling constant of the pairing interaction. We identify additional phenomenological parameters that have little effect on ground-state properties but can be used to fine-tune features such as the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule, the excitation energy of the giant dipole and Gamow-Teller resonances, the static dipole electric polarizability, and the neutron skin thickness.",1

89997,2,"Giant collimated gamma-ray flashes Bright sources of high-energy electromagnetic radiation are widely employed in fundamental research, industry and medicine 1$^{,}$2 . This motivated the construction of Compton-based facilities planned to yield bright gamma-ray pulses with energies up to 3 20 MeV. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism based on the strongly amplified synchrotron emission that occurs when a sufficiently dense ultra-relativistic electron beam interacts with a millimetre-thickness conductor. For electron beam densities exceeding approximately 3 × 10$^{19}$ cm$^{−3}$, electromagnetic instabilities occur, and the ultra-relativistic electrons travel through self-generated electromagnetic fields as large as 10$^{7}$–10$^{8}$ gauss. This results in the production of a collimated gamma-ray pulse with peak brilliance above 10$^{25}$ photons s$^{−1}$ mrad$^{−2}$ mm$^{−2}$ per 0.1% bandwidth, photon energies ranging from 200 keV to gigaelectronvolts and up to 60% electron-to-photon energy conversion efficiency.

90026,2,"Speed-of-light pulses in the massless nonlinear Dirac equation with a potential We consider the massless nonlinear Dirac (NLD) equation in 1+1 dimension with scalar-scalar self-interaction g22(Ψ¯Ψ)2 in the presence of three external electromagnetic real potentials V(x), a potential barrier, a constant potential, and a potential well. By solving numerically the NLD equation, we find different scenarios depending on initial conditions, namely, propagation of the initial pulse along one direction, splitting of the initial pulse into two pulses traveling in opposite directions, and focusing of two initial pulses followed by a splitting. For all considered cases, the final waves travel with the speed of light and are solutions of the massless linear Dirac equation. During these processes the charge and the energy are conserved, whereas the momentum is conserved when the solutions possess specific symmetries. For the case of the constant potential, we derive exact analytical solutions of the massless NLD equation that are also solutions of the massless linearized Dirac equation. Decay or growth of the initial pulse is also predicted from the evolution of the charge for the case of a non-zero imaginary part of the potential.",1
90040,2,"Stationary Random Metrics on Hierarchical Graphs Via ${(\min,+)}$ -type Recursive Distributional Equations This paper is inspired by the problem of understanding in a mathematical sense the Liouville quantum gravity on surfaces. Here we show how to define a stationary random metric on self-similar spaces which are the limit of nice finite graphs: these are the so-called hierarchical graphs. They possess a well-defined level structure and any level is built using a simple recursion. Stopping the construction at any finite level, we have a discrete random metric space when we set the edges to have random length (using a multiplicative cascade with fixed law ${m}$ ). We introduce a tool, the cut-off process, by means of which one finds that renormalizing the sequence of metrics by an exponential factor, they converge in law to a non-trivial metric on the limit space. Such limit law is stationary, in the sense that glueing together a certain number of copies of the random limit space, according to the combinatorics of the brick graph, the obtained random metric has the same law when rescaled by a random factor of law ${m}$ . In other words, the stationary random metric is the solution of a distributional equation. When the measure m has continuous positive density on ${\mathbf{R}_{+}}$ , the stationary law is unique up to rescaling and any other distribution tends to a rescaled stationary law under the iterations of the hierarchical transformation. We also investigate topological and geometric properties of the random space when m is log-normal, detecting a phase transition influenced by the branching random walk associated to the multiplicative cascade.",1

The detector is based on a SDDs array organized in a 4×2 format with each SDD square shaped with 64 mm 2 (8×8) active area. The total active area of the array is therefore 32×16 mm 2 while the total area of the detector (including 1 mm border dead area) is 34×18mm2 . The SIDDHARTA apparatus requires 48 of these modules that are designed and manufactured by Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK).

90295,2,"Exact Solutions of the Field Equations for Empty Space in the Nash Gravitational Theory John Nash has proposed a new theory of gravity. We define a Nash-tensor equal to the curvature tensor appearing in the Nash field equations for empty space, and calculate its components for two cases: 1. A static, spherically symmetric space; and 2. The expanding, homogeneous and isotropic space of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe models. We find the general, exact solution of Nash’s field equations for empty space in the static case. The line element turns out to represent the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. Also we find the simplest non-trivial solution of the field equations in the cosmological case, which gives the scale factor corresponding to the de Sitter spacetime. Hence empty space in the Nash theory corresponds to a space with Lorentz Invariant Vacuum Energy (LIVE) in the Einstein theory. This suggests that dark energy may be superfluous according to the Nash theory. We also consider a radiation filled universe model in an effort to find out how energy and matter may be incorporated into the Nash theory. A tentative interpretation of the Nash theory as a unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism leads to a very simple form of the field equations in the presence of matter. It should be noted, however, that the Nash theory is still unfinished. A satisfying way of including energy momentum into the theory has yet to be found.",1

90322,2,"Scrambling via Braiding of Nonabelions We study how quantum states are scrambled via braiding in systems of non-Abelian anyons through the lens of entanglement spectrum statistics. We define a distance between the entanglement level spacing distribution of a state evolved under random braids and that of a Haar-random state, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$. We study $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$ numerically for random braids of Majorana fermions (supplemented with random local four-body interactions) and Fibonacci anyons. For comparison, we also obtain $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$ for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of Majorana fermions with all-to-all interactions, random unitary circuits built out of (a) Hadamard (H), $\pi/8$ (T), and CNOT gates, and (b) random unitary circuits built out of two-qubit Haar-random unitaries. We define as a universal clock the Page limit-normalized entanglement entropy $S/S_{\mathrm{max}}$, which allows us to compare all different models on equal footing. Our results reveal a hierarchy of scrambling among various models --- even for the same amount of entanglement entropy --- at intermediate times, whereas all models exhibit the same late-time behavior. In particular, we find that braiding of Fibonacci anyons scrambles faster than the universal H+T+CNOT set. Our results promote $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$ as a quantifiable metric for scrambling and quantum chaos, which applies to generic quantum systems away from large-$N$ or semiclassical limits.",1

Numerical relativity has played a key role to firmly establish gravitational wave astrophysics as a new field of research, and it is now paving the way to establish whether gravitational wave radiation emitted from compact binary mergers is accompanied by electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts. As numerical relativity continues to blend in with routine gravitational wave data analyses to validate the discovery of gravitational wave events, it is essential to develop open source tools to streamline these studies. Motivated by our own experience as users and developers of the open source, community software, the Einstein Toolkit, we present an open source, Python package that is ideally suited to monitor and post-process the data products of numerical relativity simulations, and compute the gravitational wave strain at future null infinity in high performance environments. We showcase the application of this new package to post-process a large numerical relativity catalog and extract higher-order waveform modes from numerical relativity simulations of eccentric binary black hole mergers and neutron star mergers.

90378,2,"Heat capacity of a self-gravitating spherical shell of radiations We study the heat capacity of a static system of self-gravitating radiations analytically in the context of general relativity. To avoid the complexity due to a conical singularity at the center, we excise the central part and replace it with a regular spherically symmetric distribution of matters of which specifications we are not interested in. We assume that the mass inside the inner boundary and the locations of the inner and the outer boundaries are given. Then, we derive a formula relating the variations of physical parameters at the outer boundary with those at the inner boundary. Because there is only one free variation at the inner boundary, the variations at the outer boundary are related, which determines the heat capacity. To get an analytic form for the heat capacity, we use the thermodynamic identity δSrad=βδMrad additionally, which is derived from the variational relation of the entropy formula with the restriction that the mass inside the inner boundary does not change. Even if the radius of the inner boundary of the shell goes to zero, in the presence of a central conical singularity, the heat capacity does not go to the form of the regular sphere. An interesting discovery is that another legitimate temperature can be defined at the inner boundary which is different from the asymptotic one β-1.",1

By this comparison, the gauge field potential and the relativistic energy can be written by the nonrelativistic models and the spinors will be related to the orthogonal polynomials. It has also shown that the upper spinors wave functions based on the orthogonal polynomials can be given in terms of the Rodrigues representations. Association with the Rodrigues representations of orthogonal polynomials has also been investigated in the lower spinor components, since they are related to the upper spinor components according to first-order differential equation that is attained from Dirac equation.",1

90458,2,"The Status of Multi-Dimensional Core-Collapse Supernova Models Models of neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova explosions have matured considerably in recent years. Explosions of low-mass progenitors can routinely be simulated in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that these supernovae could be contributors of some lighter neutron-rich elements beyond iron. The explosion mechanism of more massive stars remains under investigation, although first 3D models of neutrino-driven explosions employing multi-group neutrino transport have become available. Together with earlier 2D models and more simplified 3D simulations, these have elucidated the interplay between neutrino heating and hydrodynamic instabilities in the post-shock region that is essential for shock revival. However, some physical ingredients may still need to be added/improved before simulations can robustly explain supernova explosions over a wide range of progenitors. Solutions recently suggested in the literature include uncertainties in the neutrino rates, rotation, and seed perturbations from convective shell burning. We review the implications of 3D simulations of shell burning in supernova progenitors for the ‘perturbations-aided neutrino-driven mechanism,’ whose efficacy is illustrated by the first successful multi-group neutrino hydrodynamics simulation of an 18 solar mass progenitor with 3D initial conditions. We conclude with speculations about the impact of 3D effects on the structure of massive stars through convective boundary mixing.",1

This is the first time that discrete subelectron readout noise has been achieved reproducible over millions of pixels on a stable, large-area detector. This enables the contemporaneous, discrete, and quantized measurement of charge in pixels, irrespective of whether they contain zero electrons or thousands of electrons. Thus, the resulting CCD detector is an ultra-sensitive calorimeter. It is also capable of counting single photons in the optical and near-infrared regime. Implementing this innovative non-destructive readout system has a negligible impact on CCD design and fabrication, and there are nearly immediate scientific applications. As a particle detector, this CCD will have unprecedented sensitivity to low-mass dark matter particles and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, while future astronomical applications may include direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets.",1

90552,2,"Euclid: Superluminous supernovae in the Deep Survey Context. In the last decade, astronomers have found a new type of supernova called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) due to their high peak luminosity and long light-curves. These hydrogen-free explosions (SLSNe-I) can be seen to z ~ 4 and therefore, offer the possibility of probing the distant Universe.Aims. We aim to investigate the possibility of detecting SLSNe-I using ESA’s Euclid satellite, scheduled for launch in 2020. In particular, we study the Euclid Deep Survey (EDS) which will provide a unique combination of area, depth and cadence over the mission.Methods. We estimated the redshift distribution of Euclid SLSNe-I using the latest information on their rates and spectral energy distribution, as well as known Euclid instrument and survey parameters, including the cadence and depth of the EDS. To estimate the uncertainties, we calculated their distribution with two different set-ups, namely optimistic and pessimistic, adopting different star formation densities and rates. We also applied a standardization method to the peak magnitudes to create a simulated Hubble diagram to explore possible cosmological constraints.Results. We show that Euclid should detect approximately 140 high-quality SLSNe-I to z ~ 3.5 over the first five years of the mission (with an additional 70 if we lower our photometric classification criteria). This sample could revolutionize the study of SLSNe-I at z > 1 and open up their use as probes of star-formation rates, galaxy populations, the interstellar and intergalactic medium. In addition, a sample of such SLSNe-I could improve constraints on a time-dependent dark energy equation-of-state, namely w(a), when combined with local SLSNe-I and the expected SN Ia sample from the Dark Energy Survey. Conclusions. We show that Euclid will observe hundreds of SLSNe-I for free. These luminous transients will be in the Euclid data-stream and we should prepare now to identify them as they offer a new probe of the high-redshift Universe for both astrophysics and cosmology.Key words: surveys / supernovae: general / cosmology: observations⋆ This paper is published on behalf of the Euclid Consortium.",1
90632,2,"Robust Limits on Photon Mass from Statistical Samples of Extragalactic Radio Pulsars The photon zero-mass hypothesis has been investigated for a long time using the frequency-dependent time delays of radio emissions from astrophysical sources. However, the search for a rest mass of the photon has been hindered by the similarity between the frequency-dependent dispersions due to the plasma and nonzero photon mass effects. Here we propose a new method through which the degeneracy of these two effects can be alleviated, by fitting a combination of the dispersion measures of radio sources. This allows us to simultaneously establish a robust limit on the photon mass. Using the observed dispersion measures from two statistical samples of extragalactic pulsars, we show that at the 68\% confidence level, the constraints on the photon mass can be as low as $m_{\gamma}\leq1.5\times10^{-48}~\rm kg\simeq8.4\times10^{-13}~{\rm eV}/c^{2}$ for the sample of 22 radio pulsars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and $m_{\gamma}\leq1.6\times10^{-48}~\rm kg\simeq8.8\times10^{-13} {\rm eV}/c^{2}$ for the other sample of 5 radio pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, which are a factor of $\sim1$ better than that obtained by a single extragalactic pulsar. Furthermore, the method presented here can also be used when more fast radio bursts with known redshifts are detected in the future.",1

We define $DT_4$ invariants by integrating the Euler class of a tautological vector bundle $L^{[n]}$ against the virtual class. We conjecture a formula for their generating series, which we prove in certain cases when $L$ corresponds to a smooth divisor on $X$. A parallel equivariant conjecture for toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds is proposed. This conjecture is proved for smooth toric divisors and verified for more general toric divisors in many examples. Combining the equivariant conjecture with a vertex calculation, we find explicit positive rational weights, which can be assigned to solid partitions. The weighted generating function of solid partitions is given by $\exp(M(q)-1)$, where $M(q)$ denotes the MacMahon function.",1
91014,2,"Caustic-based approach to understanding bunching dynamics and current spike formation in particle bunches Current modulations, current spikes, and current horns, are observed in a range of accelerator physics applications including strong bunch compression in Free Electron Lasers and linear colliders, trains of microbunching for terahertz radiation, microbunching instability and many others. This paper considers the fundamental mechanism that drives intense current modulations in dispersive regions, beyond the common explanation of nonlinear and higher-order effects. Under certain conditions, neighboring electron trajectories merge to form caustics, and often result in characteristic current spikes. Caustic lines and surfaces are regions of maximum electron density, and are witnessed in accelerator physics as folds in phase space of accelerated bunches. We identify the caustic phenomenon resulting in cusplike current profiles and derive an expression which describes the conditions needed for particle-bunch caustic formation in dispersive regions. The caustic expression not only reveals the conditions necessary for caustics to form but also where in longitudinal space the caustics will form. Particle-tracking simulations are used to verify these findings. We discuss the broader implications of this work including how to utilize the caustic expression for manipulation of the longitudinal phase space to achieve a desired current profile shape.",1

In particular, we treat the nonlocal problem of structure formation for a spherically symmetric expanding dust model and show numerically that as the central density contrast grows, it tends to decrease slowly with radial distance as the universe expands.

A carbon target has been irradiated with a 2.5 GeV proton beam supplied by the synchrotron SIS-18 at GSI to produce η′-meson bound states in C11 nuclei. Deuterons emitted at 0∘ in the reaction have been momentum analyzed by the fragment separator (FRS), used as a high-resolution spectrometer.

Upper limits on the formation cross sections of η′-mesic states are determined, and thereby a constraint imposed on the η′-nucleus interaction is discussed.",1
91187,2,"Nuclear Equation of State from ground and collective excited state properties of nuclei This contribution reviews the present status on the available constraints to the nuclear equation of state (EoS) around saturation density from nuclear structure calculations on ground and collective excited state properties of atomic nuclei. It concentrates on predictions based on self-consistent mean-field calculations, which can be considered as an approximate realization of an exact energy density functional (EDF). EDFs are derived from effective interactions commonly fitted to nuclear masses, charge radii and, in many cases, also to pseudo-data such as nuclear matter properties. Although in a model dependent way, EDFs constitute nowadays a unique tool to reliably and consistently access bulk ground state and collective excited state properties of atomic nuclei along the nuclear chart as well as the EoS. For comparison, some emphasis is also given to the results obtained with the so called ab initio approaches that aim at describing the nuclear EoS based on interactions fitted to few-body data only. Bridging the existent gap between these two frameworks will be essential since it may allow to improve our understanding on the diverse phenomenology observed in nuclei. Examples on observations from astrophysical objects and processes sensitive to the nuclear EoS are also briefly discussed. As the main conclusion, the isospin dependence of the nuclear EoS around saturation density and, to a lesser extent, the nuclear matter incompressibility remain to be accurately determined. Experimental and theoretical efforts in finding and measuring observables specially sensitive to the EoS properties are of paramount importance, not only for low-energy nuclear physics but also for nuclear astrophysics applications.",1

The industrial fabrication of cavities for the European X-ray Free Electron Laser and the International Linear Collider HiGrade Research Project allowed for an investigation of this interplay. For the serial inspection of the inner surface, the optical inspection robot 'optical bench for automated cavity inspection with high resolution on short timescales' OBACHT was constructed and to analyze the large amount of data, represented in the images of the inner surface, an image processing and analysis code was developed and new variables to describe the cavity surface were obtained.

The $1/r$ decrement of the CR density with the distance from the star cluster is a distinct signature of continuous injection of CRs and their diffusion through ISM. The analysis of $\gamma$-ray data show that the hard energy spectra of parent protons continue up to $\sim$ 1 PeV, and the efficiency of conversion of kinetic energy of powerful stellar winds can be as high as 10 percent. This implies that the population of young massive stars can provide production of CRs at a rate of up to $10^{41}$ erg/s, which is sufficient to support the flux of Galactic CRs without invoking other source populations.",1

JLab is responsible for procurement of these bellows and spools, which are delivered to JLab and FNAL for assembly into cryomodules. Achieving accelerator-grade copper plating is always a challenge and requires careful specification of requirements and application of quality control processes.

To provide sufficient longitudinal cooling LiH wedge absorbers are placed at the minima of transverse beta-function between the solenoids. An important feature of such channel (called Helical FOFO snake) is that it can cool simultaneously muons of both signs.

Real space estimators have the advantage of being local in nature and they are thus equipped to deal with the nonuniform sky coverage, especially galactic cuts and point source excisions, found in experimental data. We characterize some of the properties and limitations of these estimators and test them on simulated maps with Planck, AdvACT and CMB-S4 noise. We show that the reconstructions for large-scale lensing fields are accurate, and that the polarization reconstructions improve on those from CMB temperature maps for future experiments as expected.

91768,2,"Analytic Gravitational Waveforms for Generic Precessing Binary Inspirals Binary systems of two compact objects circularize and spiral toward each other via the emission of gravitational waves. The coupling of the spins of each object with the orbital angular momentum causes the orbital plane to precess, which leads to modulation of the gravitational wave signal. Until now, generating frequency-domain waveforms for fully precessing systems for use in gravitational wave data analysis meant numerically integrating the equations of motion, then Fourier transforming the result, which is very computationally intensive for systems that complete hundreds or thousands of cycles in the sensitive band of a detector. Previously, analytic solutions were only available for certain special cases or for simplified models.

91877,2,"One-proton emission from the $^6_{\Lambda}$Li hypernucleus One-proton (1p) radioactive emission under the influence of the Λ0-hyperon inclusion is discussed. I investigate the hyper-1p emitter, LiΛ6, with a time-dependent three-body model. Two-body interactions for α-proton and α-Λ0 subsystems are determined consistently to their resonant and bound energies, respectively. For a proton-Λ0 subsystem, a contact interaction, which can be linked to the vacuum-scattering length of the proton-Λ0 scattering, is employed. A noticeable sensitivity of the 1p-emission observables to the scattering length of the proton-Λ0 interaction is shown. The Λ0-hyperon inclusion leads to a remarkable fall of the 1p-resonance energy and width from the hyperonless α-proton resonance. For some empirical values of the proton-Λ0 scattering length, the 1p-resonance width is suggested to be of the order of 0.1–0.01 MeV. Thus, the 1p emission from LiΛ6 may occur in the time scale of 10−20–10−21 seconds, which is sufficiently shorter than the self-decay lifetime of Λ0,10−10 seconds. By taking the spin-dependence of the proton-Λ0 interaction into account, a remarkable split of the Jπ=1− and 2− 1p-resonance states is predicted. It is also suggested that, if the spin-singlet proton-Λ0 interaction is sufficiently attractive, the 1p emission from the 1− ground state is forbidden. From these results, I conclude that the 1p emission can be a suitable phenomenon to investigate the basic properties of the hypernuclear interaction, for which a direct measurement is still difficult.",1

92001,2,"Quantum theory in quaternionic Hilbert space: How Poincar\'e symmetry reduces the theory to the standard complex one We extend some results of group representation theory and von Neumann algebras to the quaternionic Hilbert space case, proving the double commutant theorem (whose quaternionic proof requires a different procedure) and extend to the quaternionic case a result concerning the classification of irreducible von Neumann algebras. Secondly, we consider elementary relativistic systems in Wigner's view defined as a locally-faithful irreducible strongly-continuous unitary representation of Poincar\'e group in quaternionic Hilbert space. We prove that, if the squared-mass operator is non-negative, the system admits a natural, Poincar\'e invariant and unique up to sign, complex structure commuting with the observables of the system leading to a physically equivalent reformulation in complex Hilbert space. Differently from the quaternionic formulation, all selfadjoint operators are now observables, Noether theorem holds and composite systems may be given in terms of tensor product. In the third part, we use a physically more accurate notion of relativistic elementary system: irreducibility regards the algebra of observables only, symmetries are automorphisms of the restricted lattice of elementary propositions and we adopt a notion of continuity referred to the states viewed as probability measures on the elementary propositions. We prove that again there exists a unique (up to sign) Poincar\'e invariant complex structure making the theory complex. Relativistic elementary systems are naturally and better described in complex Hilbert spaces even if starting from a real or quaternionic Hilbert space formulations and this complex description is uniquely fixed by physics.",1
92174,2,"Bias to CMB lensing measurements from the bispectrum of large-scale structure The rapidly improving precision of measurements of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) also requires a corresponding increase in the precision of theoretical modeling. A commonly made approximation is to model the CMB deflection angle or lensing potential as a Gaussian random field. In this paper, however, we analytically quantify the influence of the non-Gaussianity of large-scale structure (LSS) lenses, arising from nonlinear structure formation, on CMB lensing measurements. In particular, evaluating the impact of the nonzero bispectrum of large-scale structure on the relevant CMB four-point correlation functions, we find that there is a bias to estimates of the CMB lensing power spectrum. For temperature-based lensing reconstruction with CMB stage III and stage IV experiments, we find that this lensing power spectrum bias is negative and is of order 1% of the signal. This corresponds to a shift of multiple standard deviations for these upcoming experiments. We caution, however, that our numerical calculation only evaluates two of the largest bias terms and, thus, only provides an approximate estimate of the full bias. We conclude that further investigation into lensing biases from nonlinear structure formation is required and that these biases should be accounted for in future lensing analyses.",1

92240,2,"A high-precision timing ASIC for TOF-PET applications Time-of-flight (TOF) measurement in PET scanners allows a more accurate image reconstruction and/or a lower delivered radiation dose. We are developing a fully custom ASIC to take advantage of the characteristics of the SiGe Bi-CMOS process for timing measurements, integrating a fully-depleted pixel matrix with a low-power BJT-based front-end per channel, integrated on the same 100 $\mu$m thick die. All the pixels are multiplexed to a single TDC to extract timing information. Each front-end includes a BJT preamplifier with active feedback, a CMOS discriminator and a calibration DAC. A triggered readout logic is included to reduce the data to be read out of the system. The target timing resolution is 30 ps for a 511 keV photon with a 1 pF input capacitance. The front-end has a gain of $\sim 95$ mV fC$^{−1}$ and a rise time of $\sim 1$ ns. Its low power consumption of 135$\mu$W, makes it possible to stack multiple ASICs on top of each other, in order to increase the detection efficiency.

92261,2,"Model of chiral spin liquids with Abelian and non-Abelian topological phases We present a two-dimensional lattice model for quantum spin-1/2 for which the low-energy limit is governed by four flavors of strongly interacting Majorana fermions. We study this low-energy effective theory using two alternative approaches. The first consists of a mean-field approximation. The second consists of a random phase approximation (RPA) for the single-particle Green's functions of the Majorana fermions built from their exact forms in a certain one-dimensional limit. The resulting phase diagram consists of two competing chiral phases, one with Abelian and the other with non-Abelian topological order, separated by a continuous phase transition. Remarkably, the Majorana fermions propagate in the two-dimensional bulk, as in the Kitaev model for a spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice.

92362,2,"Quantum energy inequalities in premetric electrodynamics Premetric electrodynamics is a covariant framework for electromagnetism with a general constitutive relation. Its light-cone structure can be more complicated than that of Maxwell theory as is shown by the phenomenon of birefringence. We study the energy density of quantized premetric electrodynamics theories with linear constitutive relations admitting a single hyperbolicity double cone and show that averages of the energy density along the worldlines of suitable observers obey a quantum energy inequality (QEI) in states that satisfy a microlocal spectrum condition. The worldlines must meet two conditions: (a) the classical weak energy condition must hold along them, and (b) their velocity vectors have positive contractions with all positive frequency null covectors (we call such trajectories “subluminal”). After stating our general results, we explicitly quantize the electromagnetic potential in a translationally invariant uniaxial birefringent crystal. Since the propagation of light in such a crystal is governed by two nested light cones, the theory shows features absent in ordinary (quantized) Maxwell electrodynamics. We then compute a QEI bound for worldlines of inertial subluminal observers, which generalizes known results from the Maxwell theory. Finally, it is shown that the QEIs fail along trajectories that have velocity vectors which are timelike with respect to only one of the light cones.",1

As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background star, the background star’s position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses.

The prototypes are based on using low resistivity (~ 10(10) Ω·cm) glass electrodes for performing in high counting rate environment. The strip width/pitch size was chosen such to fulfill the impedance matching with the front-end electronics and the granularity requirements of the innermost zone of the CBM-TOF wall.

92696,2,"Updated Kinematic Constraints on a Dark Disk We update the method of the Holmberg & Flynn study, including an updated model of the Milky Way’s interstellar gas, radial velocities, an updated reddening map, and a careful statistical analysis, to bound the allowed surface density and scale height of a dark disk. We pay careful attention to the self-consistency of the model, including the gravitational influence of the dark disk on other disk components, and to the net velocity of the tracer stars. We find that the data set exhibits a non-zero bulk velocity in the vertical direction as well as a displacement from the expected location at the Galactic midplane. If not properly accounted for, these features would bias the bound toward low dark disk mass. We therefore perform our analysis two ways. In the first, using the traditional method, we subtract the mean velocity and displacement from the tracers’ phase space distributions. In the second method, we perform a non-equilibrium version of the HF method to derive a bound on the dark disk parameters for an oscillating tracer distribution. Despite updates in the mass model and reddening map, the traditional method results remain consistent with those of HF2000. The second, non-equilibrium technique, however, allows a surface density as large as $14\,{M}_{\odot }\,{{\rm{pc}}}^{-2}$ (and as small as $0\,{M}_{\odot }\,{{\rm{pc}}}^{-2}$), demonstrating much weaker constraints. For both techniques, the bound on surface density is weaker for larger scale height.

We construct a full pipeline from microwave sky maps to r likelihood, using two models of diffuse Galactic foregrounds with different complexity and assuming component separation with varying degrees of accuracy. Our pipeline uses a linear mixture (generalized least squares) solution for component separation, and a hybrid approach for power spectrum estimation, with a quadratic maximum likelihood estimator at low ℓs and a pseudo-C_ℓ deconvolution at high ℓs. In the likelihood for r, we explore modelling foreground residuals as nuisance parameters. Our analysis aims at measuring the bias introduced in r by mismodelling the foregrounds and to determine what error is tolerable while still successfully detecting r. We find that r = 0.01 can be measured successfully even for a complex sky model and in the presence of foreground parameters error. However, the detection of r = 0.001 is a lot more challenging, as inaccurate modelling of the foreground spectral properties may result in a biased measurement of r. Once biases are eliminated, the total error on r allows setting an upper limit rather than a detection, unless the uncertainties on the foreground spectral indices are very small, i.e. equal or better than 0.5 per cent error for both dust and synchrotron. This emphasizes the need for pursuing research on component separation and foreground characterization in view of next-generation CMB polarization experiments.",1
92943,2,"Gravitational energy is well defined The energy of gravitating systems has been an issue since Einstein proposed general relativity: considered to be ill defined, having no proper local density. Energy-momentum is now regarded as \emph{quasi-local} (associated with a closed 2-surface). We consider the pseudotensor and quasi-local proposals in the Lagrangian-Noether-Hamiltonian formulations. There are two ambiguities: (i) many expressions, (ii) each depends on some non-dynamical structure, e.g., a reference frame. The Hamiltonian approach gives a handle on both problems. Our remarkable discovery is that with a 4D isometric Minkowski reference a large class of expressions---those that agree with the Einstein pseudotensor's Freud superpotential to linear order---give a common quasi-local energy value. With a best-matched reference on the boundary this value is the non-negative Wang-Yau mass.",1

93011,2,"Path length distribution in two-dimensional causal sets We study the distribution of maximal-chain lengths between two elements of a causal set and its relationship with the embeddability of the causal set in a region of flat spacetime. We start with causal sets obtained from uniformly distributed points in Minkowski space. After some general considerations we focus on the 2-dimensional case and derive a recursion relation for the expected number of maximal chains $n_k$ as a function of their length $k$ and the total number of points $N$ between the maximal and minimal elements. By studying these theoretical distributions as well as ones generated from simulated sprinklings in Minkowski space we identify two features, the most probable path length or peak of the distribution $k_0$ and its width $\Delta$, which can be used both to provide a measure of the embeddability of the causal set as a uniform distribution of points in Minkowski space and to determine its dimensionality, if the causal set is manifoldlike in that sense. We end with a few simple examples of $n_k$ distributions for non-manifoldlike causal sets.",1
93135,2,"Numerical Relativity Simulations of Precessing Binary Neutron Star Mergers We present the first set of numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron mergers that include spin precession effects and are evolved with multiple resolutions. Our simulations employ consistent initial data in general relativity with different spin configurations and dimensionless spin magnitudes ∼0.1. They start at a gravitational-wave frequency of ∼392  Hz and cover more than 1 precession period and about 15 orbits up to merger. We discuss the spin precession dynamics by analyzing coordinate trajectories, quasilocal spin measurements, and energetics, by comparing spin aligned, antialigned, and irrotational configurations. Gravitational waveforms from different spin configuration are compared by calculating the mismatch between pairs of waveforms in the late inspiral. We find that precession effects are not distinguishable from nonprecessing configurations with aligned spins for approximately face-on binaries, while the latter are distinguishable from nonspinning configurations. Spin precession effects are instead clearly visible for approximately edge-on binaries. For the parameters considered here, precession does not significantly affect the characteristic postmerger gravitational-wave frequencies nor the mass ejection. Our results pave the way for the modeling of spin precession effects in the gravitational waveform from binary neutron star events.",1
93307,2,"Pulsar wind nebulae with bow shocks: non-thermal radiation and cosmic ray leptons Pulsars with high spin-down power produce relativistic winds radiating a non-negligible fraction of this power over the whole electromagnetic range from radio to gamma-rays in the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). The rest of the power is dissipated in the interactions of the PWNe with the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). Some of the PWNe are moving relative to the ambient ISM with supersonic speeds producing bow shocks. In this case, the ultrarelativistic particles accelerated at the termination surface of the pulsar wind may undergo reacceleration in the converging flow system formed by the plasma outflowing from the wind termination shock and the plasma inflowing from the bow shock. The presence of magnetic perturbations in the flow, produced by instabilities induced by the accelerated particles themselves, is essential for the process to work. A generic outcome of this type of reacceleration is the creation of particle distributions with very hard spectra, such as are indeed required to explain the observed spectra of synchrotron radiation with photon indices $\varGamma\lesssim 1.5$ . The presence of this hard spectral component is specific to PWNe with bow shocks (BSPWNe). The accelerated particles, mainly electrons and positrons, may end up containing a substantial fraction of the shock ram pressure. In addition, for typical ISM and pulsar parameters, the $e^{+}$ released by these systems in the Galaxy are numerous enough to contribute a substantial fraction of the positrons detected as cosmic ray (CR) particles above few tens of GeV and up to several hundred GeV. The escape of ultrarelativistic particles from a BSPWN—and hence, its appearance in the far-UV and X-ray bands—is determined by the relative directions of the interstellar magnetic field, the velocity of the astrosphere and the pulsar rotation axis. In this respect we review the observed appearance and multiwavelength spectra of three different types of BSPWNe: PSR J0437-4715, the Guitar and Lighthouse nebulae, and Vela-like objects. We argue that high resolution imaging of such objects provides unique information both on pulsar winds and on the ISM. We discuss the interpretation of imaging observations in the context of the model outlined above and estimate the BSPWN contribution to the positron flux observed at the Earth.",1
93331,2,"Analytic study of self-gravitating polytropic spheres with light rings Ultra-compact objects describe horizonless solutions of the Einstein field equations which, like black-hole spacetimes, possess null circular geodesics (closed light rings). We study analytically the physical properties of spherically symmetric ultra-compact isotropic fluid spheres with a polytropic equation of state. It is shown that these spatially regular horizonless spacetimes are generally characterized by two light rings $\{r^{\text {inner}}_{\gamma },r^{\text {outer}}_{\gamma }\}$ with the property $\mathcal{C}(r^{\text {inner}}_{\gamma })\le \mathcal{C}(r^{\text {outer}}_{\gamma })$ , where $\mathcal{C}\equiv m(r)/r$ is the dimensionless compactness parameter of the self-gravitating matter configurations. In particular, we prove that, while black-hole spacetimes are characterized by the lower bound $\mathcal{C}(r^{\text {inner}}_{\gamma })\ge 1/3$ , horizonless ultra-compact objects may be characterized by the opposite dimensionless relation $\mathcal{C}(r^{\text {inner}}_{\gamma })\le 1/4$ . Our results provide a simple analytical explanation for the interesting numerical results that have recently presented by Novotný et al. (Phys Rev D 95:043009, 2017).",1
93343,2,"Metallic phases from disordered (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics Metallic phases have been observed in several disordered two-dimensional (2D) systems, including thin films near superconductor-insulator transitions and quantum Hall systems near plateau transitions. The existence of 2D metallic phases at zero temperature generally requires an interplay of disorder and interaction effects. Consequently, experimental observations of 2D metallic behavior have largely defied explanation. We formulate a general stability criterion for strongly interacting, massless Dirac fermions against disorder, which describe metallic ground states with vanishing density of states. We show that (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED3) with a large, even number of fermion flavors remains metallic in the presence of weak scalar potential disorder due to the dynamic screening of disorder by gauge fluctuations. We also show that QED3 with weak mass disorder exhibits a stable, dirty metallic phase in which both interactions and disorder play important roles.",1
93395,2,"Majorana Fermions in a Box Motivated by potential applications to ultracold matter, we perform a theoretical study of Majorana fermions confined to a finite volume, whose boundary conditions are characterized by self-adjoint extension parameters. While the boundary conditions for Dirac fermions in (1+1)-d are characterized by a 1-parameter family, λ=-λ*, of self-adjoint extensions, for Majorana fermions λ is restricted to ±i. Based on this result, we compute the frequency spectrum of Majorana fermions confined to a 1-d interval. The boundary conditions for Dirac fermions confined to a 3-d region of space are characterized by a 4-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions, which is reduced to two distinct 1-parameter families for Majorana fermions. We also consider the problems related to the quantum mechanical interpretation of the Majorana equation as a single-particle equation. Furthermore, the equation is related to a relativistic Schrödinger equation that does not suffer from these problems. Here we restrict ourselves to theoretical considerations without yet focusing on concrete cold matter applications.",1
93502,2,"Wavelet reconstruction of E and B modes for CMB polarization and cosmic shear analyses We present new methods for mapping the curl-free (E-mode) and divergence-free (B-mode) components of spin 2 signals using spin directional wavelets. Our methods are equally applicable to measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the shear of galaxy shapes due to weak gravitational lensing. We derive pseudo- and pure wavelet estimators, where E-B mixing arising due to incomplete sky coverage is suppressed in wavelet space using scale- and orientation-dependent masking and weighting schemes. In the case of the pure estimator, ambiguous modes (which have vanishing curl and divergence simultaneously on the incomplete sky) are also cancelled. On simulations, we demonstrate the improvement (i.e. reduction in leakage) provided by our wavelet space estimators over standard harmonic space approaches. Our new methods can be directly interfaced in a coherent and computationally efficient manner with component separation or feature extraction techniques that also exploit wavelets.",1
93546,2,"An Evaluation of Cosmological Models from the Expansion and Growth of Structure Measurements We compare a large suite of theoretical cosmological models to observational data from the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of expansion, Type Ia supernova measurements of expansion, redshift space distortion measurements of the growth of structure, and the local Hubble constant. Our theoretical models include parametrizations of dark energy as well as physical models of dark energy and modified gravity. We determine the constraints on the model parameters, incorporating the redshift space distortion data directly in the analysis. To determine whether models can be ruled out, we evaluate the p-value (the probability under the model of obtaining data as bad or worse than the observed data). In our comparison, we find the well-known tension of H 0 with the other data; no model resolves this tension successfully. Among the models we consider, the large-scale growth of structure data does not affect the modified gravity models as a category particularly differently from dark energy models; it matters for some modified gravity models but not others, and the same is true for dark energy models. We compute predicted observables for each model under current observational constraints, and identify models for which future observational constraints will be particularly informative.",1

Six detectors with amplification gaps of $64,~128,~192,~220 ~\mu\mathrm{m}$ and mesh hole pitch of $63,~78 ~\mu\mathrm{m}$ were tested at room temperature and normal gas pressure. Two setups were built to evaluate the effect of the variation of the amplification gap and mesh hole pitch on different detector characteristics. The gain, energy resolution and electron transmission of these Micromegas detectors were measured in Argon-Isobutane (90:10) gas mixture while the measurements of the ion backflow were carried out in P10 gas. These measured characteristics have been compared in detail to the numerical simulations using the Garfield framework that combines packages such as neBEM, Magboltz and Heed.",1
93570,2,"Longitudinal stability in multiharmonic standing wave linacs Accelerating cavities that excite multiple modes at integer harmonics of the fundamental frequency have the potential to be used to suppress the onset of rf breakdown and reduce the pulsed surface heating at high accelerating gradients. Understanding the effect of an additional harmonic cavity mode on the longitudinal beam dynamics is important to their development and use. A Hamiltonian that describes the longitudinal motion of a particle as it traverses a chain of multiharmonic cavities has been derived and is applied to the case of a second harmonic cavity. The Hamiltonian is based upon formalisms found in literature for the fundamental harmonic and is extended to include different longitudinal field distributions and harmonic frequencies. The study initially explores the longitudinal motion for moderate accelerating gradients with high-β protons, as this will allow fundamental properties of the stable region (acceptance and shape of the rf bucket) to be determined. High accelerating gradients are also investigated but the focus will be on phase stability throughout. This work concludes by considering the longitudinal dynamics of a modified European Spallation Source accelerator, comprised of multiharmonic cavities that has specifications broadly consistent with the accelerator.",1

Jotzu , Nature (London) 515, 237 (2014)NATUAS0028-083610.1038/nature13915]—the corresponding Hamiltonians are not equivalent, the one of the shaken lattice presenting a much richer structure.",1
93660,2,"First Law of Compact Binary Mechanics with Gravitational-Wave Tails We derive the first law of binary point-particle mechanics for generic bound (i.e. eccentric) orbits at the fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) order, accounting for the non-locality in time of the dynamics due to the occurence of a gravitational-wave tail effect at that order. Using this first law, we show how the periastron advance of the binary system can be related to the averaged redshift of one of the two bodies for a slightly non-circular orbit, in the limit where the eccentricity vanishes. Combining this expression with existing analytical self-force results for the averaged redshift, we recover the known 4PN expression for the circular-orbit periastron advance, to linear order in the mass ratio.",1
93662,2,"Bending angle of light in equatorial plane of Kerr–Sen Black Hole We study the gravitational lensing by a Kerr–Sen Black Hole arising in heterotic string theory. A closed form expression for the bending angle of light in equatorial plane of Kerr–Sen Black Hole is derived as a function of impact parameter, spin and charge of the Black Hole. Results obtained are also compared with the corresponding cases of Kerr Black Hole in general relativity. It is observed that charge parameter behaves qualitatively similar as the spin parameter for photons travelling in direct orbits while behaves differently for photons in retrograde orbits around Black Hole. As the numerical value of the Black Hole charge increases, bending angle becomes larger in strong field limit. Further it is observed that this effect is more pronounced in case of direct orbits in comparison to the retro orbits. For both the direct and retro motion, the bending angle exceeds 2 π , which in turn results in multiple loops and formation of relativistic images.",1

93671,2,"The imprint of f(R) gravity on weak gravitational lensing – II. Information content in cosmic shear statistics We investigate the information content of various cosmic shear statistics on the theory of gravity. Focusing on the Hu–Sawicki-type f(R) model, we perform a set of ray-tracing simulations and measure the convergence bispectrum, peak counts and Minkowski functionals. We first show that while the convergence power spectrum does have sensitivity to the current value of extra scalar degree of freedom |fR0|, it is largely compensated by a change in the present density amplitude parameter σ8 and the matter density parameter Ωm0. With accurate covariance matrices obtained from 1000 lensing simulations, we then examine the constraining power of the three additional statistics. We find that these probes are indeed helpful to break the parameter degeneracy, which cannot be resolved from the power spectrum alone. We show that especially the peak counts and Minkowski functionals have the potential to rigorously (marginally) detect the signature of modified gravity with the parameter |fR0| as small as 10^−5 (10^−6) if we can properly model them on small (∼1 arcmin) scale in a future survey with a sky coverage of 1500 deg^2. We also show that the signal level is similar among the additional three statistics and all of them provide complementary information to the power spectrum. These findings indicate the importance of combining multiple probes beyond the standard power spectrum analysis to detect possible modifications to general relativity.",1

Despite the many applications, Einstein’s equations in the Newman-Penrose formalism appear complicated and not easily applicable to general studies of spacetimes, mainly because physical and gauge degrees of freedom are mixed in a nontrivial way. In this paper we approach the whole formalism with the goal of expressing the spin coefficients as functions of tetrad invariants once a particular tetrad is chosen. We show that it is possible to do so, and give for the first time a general recipe for the task, as well as an indication of the quantities and identities that are required.",1

93734,2,"Measuring out-of-time-order correlations and multiple quantum spectra in a trapped ion quantum magnet Highly controllable arrays of ions and ultra-cold atoms are providing exciting opportunities for realizing quantum simulators of complex many-body phenomena that can provide insights into unsolved problems in modern science. A fundamental step towards this goal is the development of protocols that can quantify how a quantum simulator builds up quantum correlations and stores quantum information starting from easily prepared uncorrelated states. Out-of-time-order correlation functions have been recently suggested as ideal probes to accomplish this task, because they can quantify the spreading, or ""scrambling"", of quantum information and set speed limits for thermalization. They might also enable experimental tests of the holographic duality between quantum and gravitational systems. Here we report experimental measurements of dynamics of out-of-time-order correlations in a quantum simulator of more than 100 ions in a Penning trap by using the many-body echo sequence developed in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance to probe the multiple quantum coherence spectrum. Our experiment involves the time reversal of the evolution under an all-to-all Ising Hamiltonian and allows us to measure the spin state purity, the spreading of many-body quantum coherences and the build-up of up to 8-body correlations. Comparisons to numerical simulations also allow us to use this protocol as a sensitive tool for quantifying and understanding various sources of decoherence. Our measurements pave the way for using time-reversal schemes for entanglement detection, quantum enhanced metrology, studies of quantum chaos, quantum phase transitions, and criticality.",1

93826,2,"Occupation probabilities of single particle levels using the microscopic interacting boson model: Application to some nuclei of interest in neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay We have developed a new method to calculate the occupancies of single particle levels in atomic nuclei. This method has been developed in the context of the microscopic interacting boson model, in which neutron and proton degrees of freedom are treated explicitly. The energies of the single particle levels constitute a very important input for the calculation of the occupancies in this method. In principle these energies can be considered as input parameters that can be fitted to reproduce the experimental occupancies. Instead of fitting, in this study we have extracted the single particle energies from experimental data on nuclei with a particle more or one particle less than a shell closure. We provide the sets of these single particle energies suitable for several major shells and apply our method to calculate the occupancies of several nuclei of interest in neutrinoless double-β decay using these sets.

Those new experimental results obtained independently shows a short hypertriton lifetime; however, each result could not be decisive. A combination similar to the PDG methodology is used to calculate the world average of the lifetime of hydrogen hyperisotopes.

The D-dimensional inverse Fourier transform has been utilized to map the momentum-space wave function to the spatial one. To regularize the logarithmic blow up of the wave function as x → 0, we employed the dimensional regularization technique.

94358,2,Modeling alignment enhancement for solid polarized targets A model of dynamic orientation using optimized radiofrequency (RF) irradiation produced perpendicular to the holding field is developed for the spin-1 system required for tensor-polarized fixed-target experiments. The derivation applies to RF produced close to the Larmor frequency of the nucleus and requires the electron spin-resonance linewidth to be much smaller than the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency. The rate equations are solved numerically to study a semi-saturated steady-state resulting from the two sources of irradiation: microwave from the DNP process and the additional RF used to manipulate the tensor polarization. The steady-state condition and continuous-wave NMR lineshape are found that optimize the spin-1 alignment in the polycrystalline materials used as solid polarized targets in charged-beam nuclear and particle physics experiments.,1
94384,2,"Topological superconductivity of spin-3/2 carriers in a three-dimensional doped Luttinger semimetal We investigate topological Cooper pairing, including gapless Weyl and fully gapped class DIII superconductivity, in a three-dimensional doped Luttinger semimetal. The latter describes effective spin-3/2 carriers near a quadratic band touching and captures the normal-state properties of the 227 pyrochlore iridates and half-Heusler alloys. Electron-electron interactions may favor non-$s$-wave pairing in such systems, including even-parity $d$-wave pairing. We argue that the lowest energy $d$-wave pairings are always of complex (e.g., $d + i d$) type, with nodal Weyl quasiparticles. This implies $\varrho(E) \sim |E|^2$ scaling of the density of states (DoS) at low energies in the clean limit, or $\varrho(E) \sim |E|$ over a wide critical region in the presence of disorder. The latter is consistent with the $T$-dependence of the penetration depth in the half-Heusler compound YPtBi. We enumerate routes for experimental verification, including specific heat, thermal conductivity, NMR relaxation time, and topological Fermi arcs. Nucleation of any $d$-wave pairing also causes a small lattice distortion and induces an $s$-wave component; this gives a route to strain-engineer exotic $s+d$ pairings. We also consider odd-parity, fully gapped $p$-wave superconductivity. For hole doping, a gapless Majorana fluid with cubic dispersion appears at the surface. We invent a generalized surface model with $\nu$-fold dispersion to simulate a bulk with winding number $\nu$. Using exact diagonalization, we show that disorder drives the surface into a critically delocalized phase, with universal DoS and multifractal scaling consistent with the conformal field theory (CFT) SO($n$)${}_\nu$, where $n \rightarrow 0$ counts replicas. This is contrary to the naive expectation of a surface thermal metal, and implies that the topology tunes the surface renormalization group to the CFT in the presence of disorder.",1

Magnetic field measurements serve for the quality assurance of the magnet production, and for validating numerical field simulation (FEM) tools and magnet design techniques. In order to study the performance of the accelerator and to allocate a budget for magnet misalignment in the tunnel, the beam physicists require the field maps and multipole field errors of the magnet system, either from validated numerical models or from magnetic measurements. When dynamic effects in the magnet exceed the capability of numerical simulations, online field measurements are done for monitoring of the magnet behavior and thus providing direct feedback to the accelerator control room for adjusting the magnet current cycles, and to tune the high-frequency accelerator cavities. The paper describes the approaches and techniques in magnetic field measurements and numerical field computations, discusses their limitations and attempts to make them consistent with the requirements from beam physics and magnet design.",1
94464,2,"Cosmology in the era of Euclid and the Square Kilometre Array Theoretical uncertainties on non-linear scales are among the main obstacles to exploit the sensitivity of forthcoming galaxy and hydrogen surveys like Euclid or the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Here, we devise a new method to model the theoretical error that goes beyond the usual cut-off on small scales. The advantage of this more efficient implementation of the non-linear uncertainties is tested through a Markov--Chain--Monte--Carlo (MCMC) forecast of the sensitivity of Euclid and SKA to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including massive neutrinos with total mass $M_\nu$, and to 3 extended scenarios, including 1) additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($\Lambda$CDM + $M_\nu$ + $N_\mathrm{eff}$), 2) a deviation from the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM + $M_\nu$ + $w_0$), and 3) a time-varying dark energy equation of state parameter ($\Lambda$CDM + $M_\nu$ + $\left(w_0,w_a \right)$). We compare the sensitivity of 14 different combinations of cosmological probes and experimental configurations. For Euclid, our method gives robust predictions for a high sensitivity to the primordial spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ ($\sigma(n_s)=0.00061$), the Hubble constant $H_0$ ($\sigma(H_0)=0.068 \, {\rm km/s/Mpc}$), the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$ ($\sigma(M_\nu)=0.012 \, {\rm eV}$) and the dark energy equation of state parameters $w_0$ ($\sigma(w_0) =0.0023$) and $w_a$ ($\sigma(w_a) = 0.013$). The predicted sensitivity to $M_\nu$ is stable against the extensions of the cosmological model considered here. Interestingly, a significant improvement of the constraints on the extended model parameters is also obtained when combining Euclid with a low redshift HI intensity mapping survey by SKA1, demonstrating the importance of the synergy of Euclid and SKA.",1

We propose a bremsstrahlung model allowing to extract information about probabilities of formation of such nucleus on the basis of analysis of experimental cross-sections of the bremsstrahlung photons.

Using the computer algebra system GAP, we have scanned all the 3D irreps of each of these groups to identify those that are subgroups of $$SU(3)$$; we have labeled each of these subgroups of $$SU(3)$$ by using the extant complete classification of the finite subgroups of $$SU(3)$$.

Once constrained by symmetry and positiveness, the encountered continuity equations provide novel quantifiers for non-classicality (non-Liouvillian fluidity) given in terms of quantum decoherence, purity and von Neumann entropy fluxes. Through definitions in the Weyl-Wigner formalism, one can identify the quantum fluctuations that distort the classical-quantum coincidence regime, and the corresponding quantum information profile, whenever some bounded x − p volume of the phase-space is specified.

94827,2,"Towards a Complete Classification of Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases for Interacting Fermions in Three Dimensions and a General Group Supercohomology Theory The classification and construction of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting boson and fermion systems have become a fascinating theoretical direction in recent years. It has been shown that (generalized) group cohomology theory or cobordism theory gives rise to a complete classification of SPT phases in interacting boson or spin systems. The construction and classification of SPT phases in interacting fermion systems are much more complicated, especially in three dimensions. In this work, we revisit this problem based on an equivalence class of fermionic symmetric local unitary transformations. We construct very general fixed-point SPT wave functions for interacting fermion systems. We naturally reproduce the partial classifications given by special group supercohomology theory, and we show that with an additional B˜H2(Gb,Z2) structure [the so-called obstruction-free subgroup of H2(Gb,Z2)], a complete classification of SPT phases for three-dimensional interacting fermion systems with a total symmetry group Gf=Gb×Z2f can be obtained for unitary symmetry group Gb.

Phys. 30, 1301–1305 (1989)] for the Teukolsky equation is proved for the case of real frequencies. The main result of the paper states that a separated solution of the Teukolsky equation governing massless test fields on the Kerr spacetime, which is purely outgoing at infinity, and purely ingoing at the horizon, must vanish. This has the consequence that for real frequencies, there are linearly independent fundamental solutions of the radial Teukolsky equation Rhor,Rout, which are purely ingoing at the horizon and purely outgoing at infinity, respectively. This fact yields a representation formula for solutions of the inhomogeneous Teukolsky equation and was recently used by Shlapentokh-Rothman [Ann.

95111,2,"Scale-invariant Feature Extraction of Neural Network and Renormalization Group Flow Theoretical understanding of how a deep neural network (DNN) extracts features from input images is still unclear, but it is widely believed that the extraction is performed hierarchically through a process of coarse graining. It reminds us of the basic renormalization group (RG) concept in statistical physics. In order to explore possible relations between DNN and RG, we use the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) applied to an Ising model and construct a flow of model parameters (in particular, temperature) generated by the RBM. We show that the unsupervised RBM trained by spin configurations at various temperatures from T=0 to T=6 generates a flow along which the temperature approaches the critical value Tc=2.27. This behavior is the opposite of the typical RG flow of the Ising model. By analyzing various properties of the weight matrices of the trained RBM, we discuss why it flows towards Tc and how the RBM learns to extract features of spin configurations.",1
95189,2,Double unification of particles with fields and electricity with gravity in non-empty space of continuous complex energies Non-empty space reading of Maxwell equations as local energy identities explains why a Coulomb field is carried rigidly by electrons in experiments. The analytical solution of the Poisson equation defines the sharp radial shape of charged elementary densities which are proportional to continuous densities of electric self-energy. Both Coulomb field and radial charge densities are free from energy divergences. Non-empty space of electrically charged mass-energy can be described by complex analytical densities resulting in real values for volume mass integrals and in imaginary values for volume charge integrals. Imaginary electric charges in the Newton gravitational law comply with real Coulomb forces. Unification of forces through complex charges rids them of radiation self-acceleration. Strong gravitational fields repeal probe bodies that might explainthe accelerated expansion of the dense Metagalaxy. Outward and inward spherical waves form the standing wave process within the radial carrier of complex energy.,1

In this work, we aim at building radiative models of thin accretion disks for both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes in STVG theory. In particular, we study stable circular equatorial orbits around stellar and supermassive black holes in Schwarzschild and Kerr STVG spacetimes. We also calculate the temperature and luminosity distributions of accretion disks around these objects. We find that accretion disks in STVG around stellar and supermassive black holes are colder and less luminous than in GR. The spectral energy distributions obtained do not contradict current astronomical observations.",1

Nuclear pasta phases are studied using both the liquid drop model as well as the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We compare the energy per nucleon for each geometry (spherical nuclei, cylindrical nuclei, nuclear slabs, cylindrical holes, and spherical holes) to obtain the ground state phase as a function of density.

95367,2,"Numerical Study on the Quench Process of Superconducting Solenoid Magnets Protected Using Quench-Back Quench-back from the mandrel has been widely used in quench protection of superconducting magnets. The rational use of quench-back requires detailed understanding of the heat transfer and electromagnetic process in the magnet during a quench process. A coupled transient thermal-electromagnetic-circuit finite-element model was developed to study the quench process with quench-back. This model sequentially solves two different physics models: one is the thermal physics model, which is used to solve the 3-D temperature field, and the other one is the coupled electromagnetic-circuit physics model, which is used to solve the 2-D axisymmetric electromagnetic field and lumped circuit model. The two models are coupled by applying results from one model as inputs into the other model. The quench process of two solenoid magnets in practical engineering is calculated using this model. Results, such as current, hot-spot temperature, and overvoltage during the quench process, were presented. The effect of quench-back on speeding up the quench process is presented. This can provide a theoretical guidance for application of quench-back in quench protection.",1

The model also includes the Tonks-Girardeau gas describing impenetrable bosons as well as an extension with truncated interactions. While the ground state wave function takes a truncated Bijl-Jastrow form, collective modes of the system are found in terms of multivariable symmetric polynomials.

95473,2,"How well can ultracompact bodies imitate black hole ringdowns? The ongoing observations of merging black holes by the instruments of the fledging gravitational wave astronomy has opened the way for testing the general-relativistic Kerr black hole metric and, at the same time, for probing the existence of more speculative horizonless ultracompact objects. In this paper we quantify the difference that these two classes of objects may exhibit in the post-merger ringdown signal. By considering rotating systems in general relativity and assuming an eikonal limit and a third-order Hartle-Thorne slow-rotation approximation, we provide the first calculation of the early ringdown frequency and damping time as a function of the body’s multipolar structure. Using the example of a gravastar, we show that the main ringdown signal may differ by as much as a few percent with respect to that of a Kerr black hole, a deviation that could be probed by near-future Advanced LIGO/Virgo searches.",1

The key idea is to solve the renormalization group flow for the effective action decomposed into the mean-field part and the correlation part. Also, we propose a simple practical method to quantify the uncertainty associated with the truncation of the correlation part. By taking the φ4 theory in zero dimension as a benchmark, we demonstrate that our method shows extremely fast convergence to the exact result even for the highly strong coupling regime.",1

95862,2,"The Dirac equation in two dimensions: Dispersive estimates and classification of threshold obstructions We investigate dispersive estimates for the two dimensional Dirac equation with a potential. In particular, we show that the Dirac evolution satisfies a t$^{−1}$ decay rate as an operator from the Hardy space H$^{1}$ to BMO, the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation. This estimate, along with the L$^{2}$ conservation law allows one to deduce a family of Strichartz estimates. We classify the structure of threshold obstructions as being composed of s-wave resonances, p-wave resonances and eigenfunctions. We show that, as in the case of the Schrödinger evolution, the presence of a threshold s-wave resonance does not destroy the t$^{−1}$ decay rate. As a consequence of our analysis we obtain a limiting absorption principle in the neighborhood of the threshold, and show that there are only finitely many eigenvalues in the spectral gap.",1

The measurement was made using a 1.3 GHz microwave cavity for use in particle accelerator R&D and equipped with a temperature mapping system for precision measurements of local heating. At peak RF fields near the quench field of the cavity, discrete jumps in local heating at the quench origin were observed. A number of these jumps were found to be identical in height within measurement error. This suggests entry of a limited number of vortices at a defect. The behavior observed appears to be consistent with recent theoretical predictions regarding vortex entry at grain boundaries in the material.",1
95884,2,"Neutron flux measurement using activated radioactive isotopes at the Baksan underground scintillation telescope Preliminary results of a neutron background measurement at the Baksan underground scintillation telescope (BUST) are presented. The external planes of the BUST are fully covered with standard scintillation detectors shielding the internal planes and suppressing thus background events due to cosmogenic and local radioactivity. The shielded internal planes were used as target for the neutron flux registration. The experimental method is based on the delayed coincidences between signals from any of the BUST counters. It is assumed that the first signal is due to inelastic interaction of a neutron with the organic scintillator, while the second signal comes from the decay of an unstable radioactive isotope formed when the fast neutron interacts with the$^{12}$C nuclei. Using the Monte-Carlo method (GEANT4) we also simulated propagation of neutrons through a layer of scintillator. The experimentally found muon induced neutron flux is j =1.3$_{-0.3}^{+0.7}$ ×10$^{-10}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for neutron energies E ≥ 22MeV, which is in a qualitative agreement with similar measurements of other underground laboratories as well as with predictions of the GEANT4.",1

The links can be randomly removed and added to the network subject to the condition of the vertex degree conservation. In these constrained graphs we run the Metropolis procedure, which favors the connected unicolor triads of nodes. Changing the chemical potential, μ, of such triads, for some wide region of μ, we find the formation of a finite plateau in the number of intercolor links, which exactly matches the finite plateau in the network algebraic connectivity (the value of the first nonvanishing eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, λ2). We claim that at the plateau the spontaneously broken Z2 symmetry is restored by the mechanism of modes collectivization in clusters of different colors. The phenomena of a finite plateau formation holds also for polychromatic networks with M≥2 colors. The behavior of polychromatic networks is analyzed via the spectral properties of their adjacency and Laplacian matrices.",1
95919,2,"Anisotropy induces non-Fermi-liquid behavior and nematic magnetic order in three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals We illuminate the intriguing role played by spatial anisotropy in three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals featuring quadratic band touching and long-range Coulomb interactions. We observe the anisotropy to be subject to an exceptionally slow renormalization group (RG) evolution so that it can be considered approximately constant when computing the impact of quantum fluctuations on the remaining couplings of the system. Using perturbative RG, we then study the competition of all local short-range interactions that are generated from the long-range interactions for fixed anisotropy. Two main effects come to light for sufficiently strong anisotropy. First, the three-dimensional system features an Abrikosov non-Fermi-liquid ground state. Second, there appear qualitatively new fixed points, which describe quantum phase transitions into phases with nemagnetic orders—higher-rank tensor orders that break time-reversal symmetry, and thus have both nematic and magnetic character. In real materials, these phases may be realized through sufficiently strong microscopic short-range interactions. On the pyrochlore lattice, the anisotropy-induced fixed points determine the onset of all-in-all-out or spin ice ordering of local magnetic moments of the electrons.",1

We first determined our model parameters using the inputs from free space and from nuclear matter properties. Then, we study some basic nuclear properties such as the nuclear binding energy with several different choices of the chiral invariant mass. We observe that our results, especially the nuclear binding energy, approach the experimental values as $m_0$ is increased until $m_0=700$ MeV and start to deviate more from the experiments afterwards with $m_0$ larger than $m_0=700$ MeV, which may imply that $m_0=700$ MeV is preferred by some nuclear properties.",1
95950,2,"Second-order cosmological perturbations. I. Produced by scalar-scalar coupling in synchronous gauge We present a systematic study of the 2nd-order scalar, vector, and tensor metric perturbations in the Einstein-de Sitter Universe in synchronous coordinates. For the scalar-scalar coupling between 1st-order perturbations, we decompose the 2nd-order perturbed Einstein equation into the respective field equations of 2nd-order scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, and obtain their solutions with general initial conditions. In particular, the decaying modes of solution are included, the 2nd-order vector is generated even if the 1st-order vector is absent, and the solution of the 2nd-order tensor corrects that in literature. We perform general synchronous-to-synchronous gauge transformations up to 2nd order generated by a 1st-order vector field ξ(1)μ and a 2nd-order ξ(2)μ. All the residual gauge modes of 2nd-order metric perturbations and density contrast are found, and their number is substantially reduced when the transformed 3-velocity of dust is set to zero. Moreover, we show that only ξ(2)μ is effective in carrying out 2nd-order transformations that we consider, because ξ(1)μ has been used in obtaining the 1st-order perturbations. Holding the 1st-order perturbations fixed, the transformations by ξ(2)μ on the 2nd-order perturbations have the same structure as those by ξ(1)μ on the 1st-order perturbations.",1

96026,2,"Berry phases in an electric-dipole-moment experiment in an all-electric storage ring Systematic effects caused by the Berry (geometric) phases in an electric-dipole-moment experiment in an all-electric storage ring are considered. We analyze the experimental setup when the spin is frozen and local longitudinal and vertical electric fields alternate. Due to the Berry phases, the spin rotates about the radial axis. The corresponding systematic error is rather important while it can be canceled with clockwise and counterclockwise beams. The Berry phases also lead to the spin rotation about the radial axis. This effect can be canceled with clockwise and counterclockwise beams as well. The sign of the azimuthal component of the angular velocity of the spin precession depends on the starting point where the spin orientation is perfect. The radial component of this quantity keeps its value and sign for each starting point. When the longitudinal and vertical electric fields are joined in the same sections without any alternation, the systematic error due to the geometric phases does not appear. However, another systematic effect of the spin rotation about the azimuthal axis takes place and has opposite signs for clockwise and counterclockwise beams.",1

When a two-surface is embedded into three-dimensional Euclidean space, the problem of finding all surfaces applicable upon it gives rise to a non-linear partial differential equation of Monge-Ampere type, first discovered by Darboux, and later reformulated by Weingarten. Even today, this problem remains very difficult, despite some remarkable results. We find an original way of generalizing the Darboux technique, which leads to a coupled set of 6 non-linear partial differential equations. For the 3-manifolds occurring in Friedmann-(Lemaitre)-Robertson-Walker cosmologies, we show that the local isometric embedding of trapped surfaces into them can be proved by solving just one non-linear equation.

The general approach is developed that enables us to construct coordinate frame regular near the horizon. As explicit examples, the Kerr and Kerr-Newmann-(anti-)de Sitter metrics are considered. It is shown how the rotational versions of the Painleve'-Gullstrand and Doran coordinates appear in this scheme as particular cases. For the 2+1 version of the metric the direct generalization of the Lema\^itre coordinate system is obtained. It is shown that the possibility of introducing a regular frame is indirectly related to the constancy of a black hole angular velocity and the rate with which the metric coefficient responsible for the rotation of spacetime, tends to it.",1
96387,2,"Modeling Vacuum Arcs in Linac Structures We describe our vacuum arc model, which divides breakdown into four stages: trigger, plasma formation, plasma evolution and surface damage. We have modeled all four stages numerically and find that the properties of surface cracks and unipolar arcs can explain essentially all the experimental data we have seen. In addition to linac breakdown, the model should apply to arcs in a wide variety of applications, such as laser ablation, tokamak edge plasmas and micrometeorite impacts. We also outline differences with other work",1
96515,2,"Excess B-modes extracted from the Planck polarization maps One of the main obstacles for extracting the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from mm/submm observations is the pollution from the main Galactic components: synchrotron, free-free and thermal dust emission. The feasibility of using simple neural networks to extract CMB has been demonstrated on both temperature and polarization data obtained by the WMAP satellite. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of neural networks for extracting the CMB signal from the <em>Planck</em> polarization data with high precision. Both auto-correlation and cross-correlation power spectra within a mask covering about 63 % of the sky have been used together with a 'high pass filter' in order to minimize the influence of the remaining systematic errors in the <em>Planck Q</em> and <em>U</em> maps. Using the Planck 2015 released polarization maps, a BB power spectrum have been extracted by <em>Multilayer Perceptron</em> neural networks. This spectrum contains a bright feature with signal to noise ratios 4.5 within 200 &#8810; l &#8810; 250. The spectrum is significantly brighter than the BICEP2 2015 spectrum, with a spectral behaviour quite different from the 'canonical' models (weak lensing plus B-modes spectra with different tensor to scalar ratios). The feasibility of the neural network to remove the residual systematics from the available <em>Planck</em> polarization data to a high level has been demonstrated..",1
96580,2,"Consistency of Hitomi, XMM-Newton, and Chandra 3.5 keV data from Perseus Hitomi observations of Perseus with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) provide a high-resolution look at the 3.5 keV feature reported by multiple groups in the Perseus cluster. The Hitomi spectrum—which involves the sum of diffuse cluster emission and the pointlike central active galactic nucleus (AGN)—does not show any excess at E∼3.5  keV, giving an apparent inconsistency with previous observations of excess diffuse emission. We point out that 2009 Chandra data reveals a strong dip in the AGN spectrum at E=(3.54±0.02)  keV (cluster frame)—the identical energy to the diffuse excess observed by XMM-Newton. Scaling this dip to the 2016 AGN luminosity and adding it to the diffuse XMM-Newton excess, this predicts an overall dip in the SXS field of view of (-5.9±4.4)×10-6  ph cm-2 s-1 at E=3.54  keV—a precise match to the Hitomi data when broadened by the dark matter virial velocity. We describe models of fluorescent dark matter that can reproduce this physics, in which dark matter absorbs and then reemits 3.5 keV photons emitted from the central AGN.",1
96681,2,Chiral nucleon forces up to N$^4$LO Three-nucleon forces play very important role in few and many-body simulations of nuclei/ nuclear reactions at low energy. Knowledge of their precise form might lead to resolution of long standing puzzles in few-nucleon physics (e.g. Ay-puzzle in elastic nucleon-deuteron scattering). Chiral effective field theory provides a systematically improvable tool for their calculation. By now three-nucleon forces have been calculated up to N3LO (partly up to N4LO) in chiral expansion. In this proceeding I will discuss the current status of their construction and their ongoing implementation in few-body calculations.,1
96682,2,"Beam Acceleration and Transition Crossing in the Fermilab Booster To suppress eddy currents, the Fermilab rapid cycling Booster synchrotron has no beam pipe; rather, its combined function dipoles are evacuated, exposing the beam directly to the magnet laminations. This arrangement significantly increases the resistive wall impedance of the dipoles and, in combination with the space charge impedance, substantially complicates longitudinal dynamics at transition. Voltage and accelerating phase profiles in the vicinity of transition are typically empirically optimized to minimize beam loss and emittance growth. In this contribution, we present results of experimental studies of beam acceleration near transition. Using comparisons between observed beam parameters and simulations, we obtain accurate calibrations for the RF program and extract quantitative information about parameters of relevance to the Booster laminated magnets longitudinal impedance model. The results are used to analyze transition crossing in the context of a future 50% increase in beam intensity planned for PIP-II, an upgrade of the Fermilab accelerating complex.",1
96712,2,"Thermodynamic properties of ideal Fermi gases in a harmonic potential in an n-dimensional space under the generalized uncertainty principle Using the semi-classical (Thomas–Fermi) approximation, the thermodynamic properties of ideal Fermi gases in a harmonic potential in an n-dimensional space are studied under the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The mean particle number, internal energy, heat capacity and other thermodynamic variables of the Fermi system are calculated analytically. Then, analytical expressions of the mean particle number, internal energy, heat capacity, chemical potential, Fermi energy, ground state energy and amendments of the GUP are obtained at low temperatures. The influence of both the GUP and the harmonic potential on the thermodynamic properties of a copper-electron gas and other systems with higher electron densities are studied numerically at low temperatures. We find: (1) When the GUP is considered, the influence of the harmonic potential is very much larger, and the amendments produced by the GUP increase by eight to nine orders of magnitude compared to when no external potential is applied to the electron gas. (2) The larger the particle density, or the smaller the particle masses, the bigger the influence of the GUP. (3) The effect of the GUP increases with the increase in the spatial dimensions. (4) The amendments of the chemical potential, Fermi energy and ground state energy increase with an increase in temperature, while the heat capacity decreases. T F0 is the Fermi temperature of the ideal Fermi system in a harmonic potential. When the temperature is lower than a certain value (0.22 times T F0 for the copper-electron gas, and this value decreases with increasing electron density), the amendment to the internal energy is positive, however, the amendment decreases with increasing temperature. When the temperature increases to the value, the amendment is zero, and when the temperature is higher than the value, the amendment to the internal energy is negative and the absolute value of the amendment increases with increasing temperature. (5) When electron density is greater than or equal to 1037 m−3, the influence of the GUP becomes the dominant factor affecting the thermodynamic properties of the system.",1
96745,2,"Neural Networks for Modeling and Control of Particle Accelerators Particle accelerators are host to myriad nonlinear and complex physical phenomena. They often involve a multitude of interacting systems, are subject to tight performance demands, and should be able to run for extended periods of time with minimal interruptions. Often times, traditional control techniques cannot fully meet these requirements. One promising avenue is to introduce machine learning and sophisticated control techniques inspired by artificial intelligence, particularly in light of recent theoretical and practical advances in these fields. Within machine learning and artificial intelligence, neural networks are particularly well-suited to modeling, control, and diagnostic analysis of complex, nonlinear, and time-varying systems, as well as systems with large parameter spaces. Consequently, the use of neural network-based modeling and control techniques could be of significant benefit to particle accelerators. For the same reasons, particle accelerators are also ideal test-beds for these techniques. Many early attempts to apply neural networks to particle accelerators yielded mixed results due to the relative immaturity of the technology for such tasks. The purpose of this paper is to re-introduce neural networks to the particle accelerator community and report on some work in neural network control that is being conducted as part of a dedicated collaboration between Fermilab and Colorado State University (CSU). We describe some of the challenges of particle accelerator control, highlight recent advances in neural network techniques, discuss some promising avenues for incorporating neural networks into particle accelerator control systems, and describe a neural network-based control system that is being developed for resonance control of an RF electron gun at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility, including initial experimental results from a benchmark controller.",1
96772,2,"Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equations in the Newman-Penrose formalism The Dirac equation on a non-torsional space-time has been studied extensively in the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. In particular, a comprehensive treatment is given by Chandrasekhar in his book `The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes', which we take as our primary source. Building upon this work, we aim to (working always in the NP formalism) explicitly write the contorsion spin coefficients in terms of the Dirac spinor components. We then generalise the Dirac equations by carrying them into a torsional space-time -- where it is known in this form as the Hehl-Datta equation -- as permitted by the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble (ECSK) framework which has non-vanishing torsion. Finally, we write down the full Einstein-Cartan-Dirac (ECD) equations in the NP formalism, and provide a solution (on Minkowski background) in various specific cases. In particular, we demonstrate how torsion physically changes the solutions of the torsion-free Dirac equations.",1
96832,2,"Discovery of recombining plasma from the faintest GeV SNR HB 21 and a possible scenario of the cosmic ray escaping from SNR shocks We present an X-ray study of the GeV gamma-ray supernova remnant (SNR) HB 21 with Suzaku. HB 21 is interacting with molecular clouds and the faintest in the GeV band among known GeV SNRs. We discovered strong radiative recombination continua of Si and S from the center of the remnant, which provide the direct evidence of a recombining plasma (RP). The total emission can be explained with the RP and ionizing plasma components. The electron temperature and recombination timescale of the RP component were estimated as 0.17 (0.15-0.18) keV and 3.2 (2.0-4.8) $\times$ 10$^{11}$ s cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The estimated age of the RP (RP age; $\sim$ 170 kyr) is the longest among known recombining GeV SNRs, because of very low density of electrons ($\sim$ 0.05 cm$^{-3}$). We have examined dependencies of GeV spectral indices on each of RP ages and SNR diameters for nine recombining GeV SNRs. Both showed possible positive correlations, indicating that both the parameters can be good indicators of properties of accelerated protons, for instance, degree of escape from the SNR shocks. A possible scenario for a process of proton escape is introduced; interaction with molecular clouds makes weaker magnetic turbulence and cosmic-ray protons escape, simultaneously cooling down the thermal electrons and generate an RP.",1
96854,2,"Universal scaled Higgs-mass gap for the bilayer Heisenberg model in the ordered phase The spectral properties for the bilayer quantum Heisenberg model were investigated with the numerical diagonalization method. In the ordered phase, there appears the massive Higgs excitation embedded in the continuum of the Goldstone excitations. Recently, it was claimed that the properly scaled Higgs mass is a universal constant in proximity to the critical point. Diagonalizing the finite-size cluster with N ≤ 36 spins, we calculated the dynamical scalar susceptibility \hbox{$\chi_s''(\omega)$} χ s ′′ ( ω ) , which is rather insensitive to the Goldstone mode. A finite-size-scaling analysis of \hbox{$\chi_s ''(\omega)$} χ s ′′ ( ω ) is made, and the universal (properly scaled) Higgs mass is estimated.",1

A transition is implemented to a Schr\""odinger-type relativistic equation. For the case where the angular and radial variables are not separated, the method of obtaining effective potentials is generalized. Effective potentials have isolated singularities on the event horizons as well as at certain parameters of the Kerr-Newman field and of the fermion in the neighborhoods of some values of the radial coordinate. For the extreme Kerr-Newman field, the impossibility of existence of stationary bound states of half-spin particles is proved.",1
97025,2,"Emergent SO(5) symmetry at the columnar ordering transition in the classical cubic dimer model The classical cubic-lattice dimer model undergoes an unconventional transition between a columnar crystal and a dimer liquid, in the same universality class as the deconfined quantum critical point in spin-1/2 antiferromagnets but with very different microscopic physics and microscopic symmetries. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this transition has an emergent SO(5) symmetry relating quantities characterizing the two adjacent phases. While the low-temperature phase has a conventional order parameter, the defining property of the Coulomb liquid on the high-temperature side is deconfinement of monomers, and so the SO(5) symmetry relates fundamentally different types of objects. We study linear system sizes up to $L=96$, and find that this symmetry applies with an excellent precision that consistently improves with system size over this range. It is remarkable that SO(5) emerges in a system as basic as the cubic dimer model, with only simple discrete degrees of freedom. Our results are important evidence for the generality of the SO(5) symmetry that has been proposed for the NCCP$^1$ field theory. We describe a possible interpretation for these results in terms of a consistent hypothesis for the renormalization-group flow structure, allowing for the possibility that SO(5) may ultimately be a near-symmetry rather than an exact one.",1

We provide intrinsic Newton–Cartan definitions of Killing tensors and conformal Schrödinger–Killing tensors, and we discuss their respective links to conserved quantities and to the higher symmetries of the Schrödinger equation.

97147,2,"Nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model in discrete complex analysis We examine a discrete version of the two-dimensional nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model derived from discrete complex analysis. We adopt two lattices, one rectangular, the other polar. We define a discrete energy $E({f})^{\rm disc.}$ and a discrete area ${\cal{A}}({f})^{\rm disc.}$, where the function $f$ is related to a stereographic projection governed by a unit vector of the model. The discrete energy and area satisfy the inequality $E({f})^{\rm disc.} \ge |{\cal{A}}({f})^{\rm disc.}|$, which is saturated if and only if the function $f$ is discrete (anti-)holomorphic. We show for the rectangular lattice that, except for a factor 2, the discrete energy and the area tend to the usual continuous energy $E({f})$ and the area ${\cal{A}}({f})=4 \pi N, \,\,N\in \pi_2(S^2)$ as the lattice spacings tend to zero. In the polar lattice, we section the plane by $2M$ lines passing through the origin into $2M$ equal sectors and place vertices radially in a geometric progression with a common ratio $q$. For this polar lattice, the Euler--Lagrange equation derived from the discrete energy $E({f})^{\rm disc.}$ yields rotationally symmetric (anti-)holomorphic solutions $f(z)=Cz^{\pm 1}\,\,(C\bar{z}^{\pm 1})$ in the zeroth order of $\kappa:=q^{-1}-q$. We find that the discrete area evaluated by these zeroth-order solutions is expressible as a $q$-integral (the Jackson integral). Moreover, the area tends to $\pm 2\cdot 4\pi$ in the continuum limit ($M \to \infty$ and $q \to 1\!-0$) with fixed discrete conformal structure $\rho_0 =2 \sin{(\pi/M)}/ \kappa$.",1

97182,2,"Interface localization near criticality The theory of interface localization in near-critical planar systems at phase coexistence is formulated from first principles. We show that mutual delocalization of two interfaces, amounting to interfacial wetting, occurs when the bulk correlation length critical exponent ν is larger than or equal to 1. Interaction with a boundary or defect line involves an additional scale and a dependence of the localization strength on the distance from criticality. The implications are particularly rich in the boundary case, where delocalization proceeds through different renormalization patterns sharing the feature that the boundary field becomes irrelevant in the delocalized regime. The boundary delocalization (wetting) transition is shown to be continuous, with surface specific heat and layer thickness exponents which can take values that we determine.",1
97227,2,"Topological Phase Transitions in Multicomponent Superconductors We study the phase transition between a trivial and a time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor in a single-band system. By analyzing the interplay of symmetry, topology, and energetics, we show that for a generic normal state band structure, the phase transition occurs via extended intermediate phases in which even- and odd-parity pairing components coexist. For inversion-symmetric systems, the coexistence phase spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. For noncentrosymmetric superconductors, the low-temperature intermediate phase is time-reversal breaking, while the high-temperature phase preserves time-reversal symmetry and has topologically protected line nodes. Furthermore, with approximate rotational invariance, the system has an emergent U(1)×U(1) symmetry, and novel topological defects, such as half vortex lines binding Majorana fermions, can exist. We analytically solve for the dispersion of the Majorana fermion and show that it exhibits small and large velocities at low and high energies.

To obtain the evolution of the trajectory and momentum of the electron for modeling its acceleration the wakefield structure was determined.

We show that supersymmetry is not only an emergent property of the scaling limit but also manifests itself on the lattice. Namely, we find explicit lattice expressions for the supersymmetry generators and currents. Writing the Hamiltonian in terms of these generators allows us to find the ground states exactly at a frustration-free coupling. These confirm the coexistence between two (topologically) ordered ground states and a disordered one in the gapped phase. Deforming the model by including explicit chiral symmetry breaking, we find the phases persist up to an unusual chiral phase transition where the supersymmetry becomes exact even on the lattice.",1
97326,2,"Testing Emergent Gravity with Isolated Dwarf Galaxies Verlinde (2016) has proposed a new modified theory of gravity, Emergent Gravity (EG), as an alternative to dark matter. EG reproduces the Tully-Fisher relationship with no free parameters, and agrees with the velocity curves of most massive, spiral galaxies well. In its current form, the theory only applies to isolated, spherically symmetric systems in a dark energy-dominated Universe, and thus can only be tested fairly with such systems. Here I develop equations for EG's velocity curve predictions given a realistic, extended mass distribution. I apply this to isolated dwarf galaxies. Then I test the predictions from EG versus the maximum velocity measurements of 81 isolated dwarf galaxies with projected shapes close to circular. I find that EG severely underpredicts the maximum velocities for those galaxies with measured velocities v>165 km/s. Most of these galaxies have greater HI gas masses than stellar masses, and it is seems that EG is unable to describe these systems well. Rotation curves of these isolated, HI gas-rich, nearly spherical dwarf galaxies would provide the definitive test of EG.",1

The experimental results showed a dependence of the beamlets’ positions on the total beam intensity.

We use a complete and rigorous statistical indicator to measure the level of concordance between cosmological data sets, without relying on the inspection of the marginal posterior distribution of some selected parameters. We apply this test to state of the art cosmological data sets, to assess their agreement within the Λ cold dark matter model. We find that there is a good level of concordance between all the experiments with one noticeable exception. There is substantial evidence of tension between the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization measurements of the Planck satellite and the data from the CFHTLenS weak lensing survey even when applying ultraconservative cuts.

97758,2,"Exploring compensated isocurvature perturbations with CMB spectral distortion anisotropies We develop a linear perturbation theory for the spectral $y$-distortions of the cosmic microwave background(CMB). The $y$-distortions generated during the recombination epoch are usually negligible because the energy transfer due to the Compton scattering is strongly suppressed at that time, but they can be significant if there is a considerable amount of compensated isocurvature perturbation(CIP), which is not tightly constrained from the present CMB observations. The linear $y$-distortions explicitly depend on the baryon density fluctuations, therefore $y$ anisotropies can completely resolve the degeneracy between the baryon isocurvature perturbations and the cold dark matter ones. This novel method is free from lensing contaminations that can affect the previous approach to the CIPs based on the nonlinear modulation of the CMB anisotropies. We compute the cross correlation functions of the $y$-distortions with the CMB temperature and the $E$ mode polarization anisotropies. They are sensitive to the correlated CIPs parameterized by $f'\equiv\mathcal P_{\rm CIP\zeta}/\mathcal P_{\zeta \zeta}$ with $\mathcal P_{\zeta \zeta}$ and $\mathcal P_{\rm CIP\zeta}$ being the auto correlation of the adiabatic perturbations and the cross correlation between them and the CIPs. We investigate how well the $y$ anisotropies will constrain $f'$ in future observations such as those provided by a PIXIE-like and a PRISM-like survey, LiteBIRD and a cosmic variance limited(CVL) survey, taking into account the degradation in constraining power due to the presence of Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect from galaxy clusters. For example, our forecasts show that it is possible to achieve an upper limit of $f'< 10^{5}$ at 68\% C.L. with LiteBIRD, and $f'<2\times 10^{4}$ with CVL observations.",1

97842,2,"Isospin Dependence of the EMC effect and Short range Correlations Recent studies have shown that the per-nucleon number of Short-Range Correlated (SRC) pairs in nuclei and the strength of the EMC effect are linearly correlated, increasing from light nuclei up to iron and then saturating. This paper shows that the per-proton number of SRC pairs and the strength of the EMC effect are linearly correlated and increase from light to heavy asymmetric neutron-rich nuclei without saturation. These quantities, calculated per neutron, are also linearly related, but saturate (have constant value) remarkably early, starting with 12C. We propose that the observed phenomenological relationships indicate an isospin dependence of the EMC effect which is associated with the dominance of SRCs by neutron-proton pairs from 3He to heavy asymmetric neutron-rich nuclei.",1
97868,2,"An architecture for efficient gravitational wave parameter estimation with multimodal linear surrogate models The recent direct observation of gravitational waves has further emphasized the desire for fast, low-cost, and accurate methods to infer the parameters of gravitational wave sources. Due to expense in waveform generation and data handling, the cost of evaluating the likelihood function limits the computational performance of these calculations. Building on recently developed surrogate models and a novel parameter estimation pipeline, we show how to quickly generate the likelihood function as an analytic, closed-form expression. Using a straightforward variant of a production-scale parameter estimation code, we demonstrate our method using surrogate models of effective-one-body and numerical relativity waveforms. Our study is the first time these models have been used for parameter estimation and one of the first ever parameter estimation calculations with multi-modal numerical relativity waveforms, which include all $\ell \leqslant 4$ modes. Our grid-free method enables rapid parameter estimation for any waveform with a suitable reduced-order model. The methods described in this paper may also find use in other data analysis studies, such as vetting coincident events or the computation of the coalescing-compact-binary detection statistic.",1

We discuss dissipative and radiative processes in the jet and how radiative transfer shapes the observed nonthermal spectrum released at the photosphere. A comparison of recent detailed models with observations gives estimates for important parameters of GRB jets, such as the Lorentz factor and magnetization. We also discuss predictions for GRB polarization and neutrino emission.",1
98007,2,"Neutron capture cross section measurement of $^{238}$U at the CERN n_TOF facility in the energy region from 1 eV to 700 keV The aim of this work is to provide a precise and accurate measurement of the U238(n,γ) reaction cross section in the energy region from 1 eV to 700 keV. This reaction is of fundamental importance for the design calculations of nuclear reactors, governing the behavior of the reactor core. In particular, fast reactors, which are experiencing a growing interest for their ability to burn radioactive waste, operate in the high energy region of the neutron spectrum. In this energy region most recent evaluations disagree due to inconsistencies in the existing measurements of up to 15%. In addition, the assessment of nuclear data uncertainty performed for innovative reactor systems shows that the uncertainty in the radiative capture cross section of U238 should be further reduced to 1–3% in the energy region from 20 eV to 25 keV. To this purpose, addressed by the Nuclear Energy Agency as a priority nuclear data need, complementary experiments, one at the GELINA and two at the n_TOF facility, were proposed and carried out within the 7th Framework Project ANDES of the European Commission. The results of one of these U238(n,γ) measurements performed at the n_TOF CERN facility are presented in this work. The γ-ray cascade following the radiative neutron capture has been detected exploiting a setup of two C6D6 liquid scintillators. Resonance parameters obtained from this work are on average in excellent agreement with the ones reported in evaluated libraries. In the unresolved resonance region, this work yields a cross section in agreement with evaluated libraries up to 80 keV, while for higher energies our results are significantly higher.",1
98085,2,"The Statistical Properties of the -Deformed Dirac Oscillator in One and Two Dimensions We study the behavior of the eigenvalues of the one and two dimensions of -deformed Dirac oscillator. The eigensolutions have been obtained by using a method based on the -deformed creation and annihilation operators in both dimensions. For a two-dimensional case, we have used the complex formalism which reduced the problem to a problem of one-dimensional case. The influence of the -numbers on the eigenvalues has been well analyzed. Also, the connection between the -oscillator and a quantum optics is well established. Finally, for very small deformation , we (i) showed the existence of well-known -deformed version of Zitterbewegung in relativistic quantum dynamics and (ii) calculated the partition function and all thermal quantities such as the free energy, total energy, entropy, and specific heat. The extension to the case of Graphene has been discussed only in the case of a pure phase ().",1
98156,2,"Gaseous electron multiplier gain characteristics using low-pressure Ar/CO$_{2}$ Gaseous Electron Multiplier detectors, or GEMs, show promise for use on space-based X-ray missions. Operating pressure strongly affects the gain of the detector and must be optimized for best performance. We have measured the gain characteristics of a GEM detector at various pressures below atmosphere using a mixture of Ar:CO$_{2}$ with the goal of maximizing gain to push GEM capabilities to the lowest energies possible. This paper discusses our tests, results, and their implications for choosing a detector pressure. We found that at any operating pressure the detector voltage can be adjusted to achieve roughly the same maximum gain prior to the onset of electrical discharges. We also find that the gain varies substantially by spatial location across the detector, but this variation is insensitive to changes in pressure allowing it to be calibrated and corrected if necessary. The detector pressure can therefore be optimized in the interest of other performance parameters such as leak rate, window stress, power requirements, or quantum efficiency without concern for negatively affecting the gain. These results can inform the choice of operating pressure and voltage for GEMs used onboard future space missions.",1
98219,2,"Capturing Structural Dynamics in Crystalline Silicon Using Chirped Electrons from a Laser Wakefield Accelerator Recent progress in laser wakefield acceleration has led to the emergence of a new generation of electron and X-ray sources that may have enormous benefits for ultrafast science. These novel sources promise to become indispensable tools for the investigation of structural dynamics on the femtosecond time scale, with spatial resolution on the atomic scale. Here, we demonstrate the use of laser-wakefield-accelerated electron bunches for time-resolved electron diffraction measurements of the structural dynamics of single-crystal silicon nano-membranes pumped by an ultrafast laser pulse. In our proof-of-concept study, we resolve the silicon lattice dynamics on a picosecond time scale by deflecting the momentum-time correlated electrons in the diffraction peaks with a static magnetic field to obtain the time-dependent diffraction efficiency. Further improvements may lead to femtosecond temporal resolution, with negligible pump-probe jitter being possible with future laser-wakefield-accelerator ultrafast-electron-diffraction schemes.",1
98243,2,"Lensing convergence in galaxy clustering in ΛCDM and beyond We study the impact of neglecting lensing magnification in galaxy clustering analyses for future galaxy surveys, considering the ΛCDM model and two extensions: massive neutrinos and modifications of General Relativity. Our study focuses on the biases on the constraints and on the estimation of the cosmological parameters. We perform a comprehensive investigation of these two effects for the upcoming photometric and spectroscopic galaxy surveys Euclid and SKA for different redshift binning configurations. We also provide a fitting formula for the magnification bias of SKA. Our results show that the information present in the lensing contribution does improve the constraints on the modified gravity parameters whereas the lensing constraining power is negligible for the ΛCDM parameters. For photometric surveys the estimation is biased for all the parameters if lensing is not taken into account. This effect is particularly significant for the modified gravity parameters. Conversely for spectroscopic surveys the bias is below one sigma for all the parameters. Our findings show the importance of including lensing in galaxy clustering analyses for testing General Relativity and to constrain the parameters which describe its modifications.",1
98293,2,"An analytical approach to the CMB polarization in a spatially closed background The scalar mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is derived in a spatially closed universe from the Boltzmann equation using the line of sight integral method. The EE and TE multipole coefficients have been extracted analytically by considering some tolerable approximations such as considering the evolution of perturbation hydrodynamically and sudden transition from opacity to transparency at the time of last scattering. As the major advantage of analytic expressions, CEE,ℓS and CTE,ℓS explicitly show the dependencies on baryon density ΩB , matter density ΩM , curvature ΩK , primordial spectral index ns , primordial power spectrum amplitude As , Optical depth τreion , recombination width σt and recombination time tL . Using a realistic set of cosmological parameters taken from a fit to data from Planck, the closed universe EE and TE power spectrums in the scalar mode are compared with numerical results from the CAMB code and also latest observational data. The analytic results agree with the numerical ones on the big and moderate scales. The peak positions are in good agreement with the numerical result on these scales while the peak heights agree with that to within 20% due to the approximations have been considered for these derivations. Also, several interesting properties of CMB polarization are revealed by the analytic spectra.",1
98342,2,"Solution-generating methods of Einstein's equations by Hamiltonian reduction The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a new method of generating exact solutions to the Einstein's equations obtained by the Hamiltonian reduction. The key element to the successful Hamiltonian reduction is finding the privileged spacetime coordinates in which physical degrees of freedom manifestly reside in the conformal two-metric, and all the other metric components are determined by the conformal two-metric. In the privileged coordinates the Einstein's constraint equations become trivial; the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints are simply the defining equations of a non-vanishing gravitational Hamiltonian and momentum densities in terms of conformal two-metric and its conjugate momentum, respectively. Thus, given any conformal two-metric, which is a constraint-free data, one can construct the whole 4-dimensional spacetime by integrating the first-order superpotential equations. As the first examples of using Hamiltonian reduction in solving the Einstein's equations, we found two exact solutions to the Einstein's equations in the privileged coordinates. Suitable coordinate transformations from the privileged to the standard coordinates show that they are just the Einstein-Rosen wave and the Schwarzschild solution. The local gravitational Hamiltonian and momentum densities of these spacetimes are also presented in the privileged coordinates.",1
98414,2,"From dynamical scaling to local scale-invariance: a tutorial Dynamical scaling arises naturally in various many-body systems far from equilibrium. After a short historical overview, the elements of possible extensions of dynamical scaling to a local scale-invariance will be introduced. Schrödinger-invariance, the most simple example of local scale-invariance, will be introduced as a dynamical symmetry in the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class of interface growth. The Lie algebra construction, its representations and the Bargman superselection rules will be combined with non-equilibrium Janssen-de Dominicis field-theory to produce explicit predictions for responses and correlators, which can be compared to the results of explicit model studies. At the next level, the study of non-stationary states requires to go over, from Schrödinger-invariance, to ageing-invariance. The ageing algebra admits new representations, which acts as dynamical symmetries on more general equations, and imply that each non-equilibrium scaling operator is characterised by two distinct, independent scaling dimensions. Tests of ageing-invariance are described, in the Glauber-Ising and spherical models of a phase-ordering ferromagnet and the Arcetri model of interface growth.",1

98507,2,"The Dark Energy Survey: more than dark energy – an overview This overview paper describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4 m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion, the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterize dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large-scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper, we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from ‘Science Verification’, and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the Solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Λ+cold dark matter, then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 trans-Neptunian objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z > 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).",1
98558,2,"Entanglement structure of non-equilibrium steady states We study the problem of calculating transport properties of interacting quantum systems, specifically electrical and thermal conductivities, by computing the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of the system biased by contacts. Our approach is based on the structure of entanglement in the NESS. With reasonable physical assumptions, we show that a NESS close to local equilibrium is lightly entangled and can be represented via a computationally efficient tensor network. We further argue that the NESS may be found by dynamically evolving the system within a manifold of appropriate low entanglement states. A physically realistic law of dynamical evolution is Markovian open system dynamics, or the Lindblad equation. We explore this approach in a well-studied free fermion model where comparisons with the literature are possible. We study both electrical and thermal currents with and without disorder, and compute entropic quantities such as mutual information and conditional mutual information. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects of this approach for the challenging problem of transport in strongly interacting systems, especially those with disorder.",1
98591,2,"Collisions versus stellar winds in the runaway merger scenario: place your bets The runaway merger scenario is one of the most promising mechanisms to explain the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in young dense star clusters (SCs). On the other hand, the massive stars that participate in the runaway merger lose mass by stellar winds. This effect is tremendously important, especially at high metallicity. We discuss N-body simulations of massive (~6x10^4 Msun) SCs, in which we added new recipes for stellar winds and supernova explosion at different metallicity. At solar metallicity, the mass of the final merger product spans from few solar masses up to ~30 Msun. At low metallicity (0.01-0.1 Zsun) the maximum remnant mass is ~250 Msun, in the range of IMBHs. A large fraction (~0.6) of the massive remnants are not ejected from the parent SC and acquire stellar or black hole companions. Finally, I discuss the importance of this result for gravitational wave detection.",1
98663,2,"New trial wave function for the nuclear cluster structure of nuclei A new trial wave function is proposed for nuclear cluster physics, in which an exact solution to the long-standing center-of-mass problem is given. In the new approach, the widths of the single-nucleon Gaussian wave packets and the widths of the relative Gaussian wave functions describing correlations of nucleons or clusters are treated as variables in the explicit intrinsic wave function of the nuclear system. As an example, this new wave function was applied to study the typical $${^{20}{\rm Ne}}$$ ($$\alpha$$+$${{^{16}}{\rm O}}$$) cluster system. By removing exactly the spurious center-of-mass effect in a very simple way, the energy curve of $${^{20}{\rm Ne}}$$ was obtained by variational calculations with the width of the $$\alpha$$ cluster, the width of the $${{^{16}}{\rm O}}$$ cluster, and the size parameter of the nucleus. These are considered the three crucial variational variables in describing the $${^{20}{\rm Ne}}$$ ($$\alpha$$+$${{^{16}}{\rm O}}$$) cluster system. This shows that the new wave function can be a very interesting new tool for studying many-body and cluster effects in nuclear physics.",1

We model the leads of the quantum point contact as Luttinger liquids, incorporate the effects of finite temperature and analyze the detection-induced decoherence rate and the detector efficiency, Q. We find that interactions generically reduce the induced decoherence along with the detector's efficiency, and strongly affect the relative strength of the decoherence induced by tunneling and that induced by interactions with the local density. With increasing interaction strength, the regime of quantum-limited detection (Q→1) is shifted to increasingly lower temperatures or higher bias voltages respectively. For small to moderate interaction strengths, Q is a monotonously decreasing function of temperature as in the noninteracting case. Surprisingly, for sufficiently strong interactions we identify an intermediate temperature regime where the efficiency of the detector increases with rising temperature.",1
98695,2,"Neo-Cartesian Unified Fluid Theory: From the Classical Wave Equation to De Broglie’s Lorentzian Quantized Mechanics and Quantized Gravity This paper introduces a fluid aether formed by discrete, 3D-extended energy-like sagions obeying three conservation principles of classical mechanics: total energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum. In contrast to Newtonian mechanics, neither mass, nor force are primitive notions (hence, the Cartesian”), but the theory is atomistic (hence the “neo”). Firstly, the notions of field, continuity, discreteness, extension, and philosophical and empirical reasons leading to reinstating aether are clarified. The collective fluid behaviour is described by the classical wave equation, also known as the homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation (HKGE). Connections of electromagnetism (EM), gravity and quantum mechanics (QM) to the theory of fluids are noted. The goal is to attain a unified field theory that contain as special cases the other “forces”. In particular, QM must be relativistic ab initio for consistency with Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GTR), while GTR must be extended to allow for permanent violation of the principle of equivalence, in the sense that gravity interactions depend upon composition of matter, as effectively observed in the original Eötvös experiment, and in the outstanding, but neglected, experiments of Quirino Majorana. Of particular interest are three families of nonharmonic solutions to the HKGE discovered by this author in the 1990s. The minimum angular momentum in sagion-sagion interactions is identified as Planck constant, thus introducing quantum features in classical mechanics. Coalescence of sagions leads to a kinematic theory of photons and fundamental particles, whose simplest object is a rotating dumbbell, which forms a torus in 3D-space. Acceleration produced by successive pushes of a small projectile (say, a sagion) generates an acceleration curve resembling Einstein’s mass increase, thus giving a different interpretation to some claims of special theory of relativity (STR); in particular, Bertozzi experiment is explained as an inefficient transfer of linear momentum, and the fitting of Bertozzi data by neo-Cartesian predictions is superior to STR’s predictions.",1

In the present paper we consider only the averaged dynamics of the Universe at very large scales, allowing us to work with conformal flat geometry. The corresponding covariant propagation and constraint equations are treated in a shear-free nonrelativistic limit. The dynamics is described with a Lagrangian in minisuperspace. Analytic solutions for the energy density, the Hubble function and the 1st order relativistic correction to the spatial curvature are obtained by means of two conditional dynamical symmetries. This leads to a cosmological model where the accelerated expansion of the Universe is driven by a time-dependent spatial curvature without the need for introducing any kind of dark energy. A differential equation for the area distance is derived in addition.",1

98756,2,"Partial restoration of spin-isospin SU(4) symmetry and the one-quasiparticle random-phase approximation method in double- β decay The one-quasiparticle random-phase approximation (one-QRPA) method is used to describe simultaneously both double-β-decay modes, giving special attention to the partial restoration of spin-isospin SU(4) symmetry. To implement this restoration and to fix the model parameters, we resort to the energetics of Gamow-Teller resonances and to the minima of the single-β+-decay strengths. This makes the theory predictive regarding the ββ2ν decay, producing the 2ν moments in Ca48, Ge76, Se82, Zr96, Mo100, Te128,130, and Nd150, that are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental ones; however, the agreement with ββ2ν data is only modest. To include contributions coming from induced nuclear weak currents, we extend the ββ0ν-decay formalism employed previously in C. Barbero et al., Nucl. Phys. A 628, 170 (1998)NUPABL0375-947410.1016/S0375-9474(97)00614-3, which is based on the Fourier-Bessel expansion. The numerical results for the ββ0ν moments in the above mentioned nuclei are similar to those obtained in other theoretical studies although smaller on average by ∼40%. We attribute this difference basically to the one-QRPA method, employed here for the first time, instead of the currently used two-QRPA method. The difference is partially due also to the way of carrying out the restoration of the spin-isospin symmetry. It is hard to say which is the best way to make this restoration, since the ββ0ν moments are not experimentally measurable. The recipe proposed here is based on physically robust arguments. The numerical uncertainties in the ββ moments, related to (i) their strong dependence on the residual interaction in the particle-particle channel when evaluated within the QRPA, and (ii) lack of proper knowledge of single-particle energies, have been quantified. It is concluded that the partial restoration of the SU(4) symmetry, generated by the residual interaction, is crucial in the description of the ββ decays, regardless of the nuclear model used.",1
98763,2,"Substructure and galaxy formation in the Copernicus Complexio warm dark matter simulations We use the Copernicus Complexio (coco) high-resolution N-body simulations to investigate differences in the properties of small-scale structures in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model and in a model with a cutoff in the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations consistent with both a thermally produced warm dark matter (WDM) particle with a rest mass of 3.3 keV and a sterile neutrino with mass 7 keV and leptogenesis parameter L_6 = 8.7. The latter corresponds to the ‘coldest’ model with this sterile neutrino mass compatible with the identification of the recently detected 3.5 keV X-ray line as resulting from particle decay. CDM and WDM predict very different number densities of subhaloes with mass ≲ 10^9 h^−1 M_⊙ although they predict similar, nearly universal, normalized subhalo radial density distributions. Haloes and subhaloes in both models have cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White profiles, but WDM subhaloes below the cut-off scale in the power spectrum (corresponding to maximum circular velocities V_maxz = 0 ≤ 50 kms− 1) are less concentrated than their CDM counterparts. We make predictions for observable properties using the galform semi-analytic model of Galaxy formation. Both models predict Milky Way satellite luminosity functions consistent with observations, although the WDM model predicts fewer very faint satellites.

TMC superconducting wires were developed and studied in academia and industry, i.e., Mitsubishi (Japan), Alstom (France), and Plansee (Austria), until the mid-1990s.

98968,2,"An operator-based local discontinuous  Galerkin method compatible with the BSSN  formulation of the Einstein equations Discontinuous Galerkin finite element (DGFE) methods offer a mathematically beautiful, computationally efficient, and efficiently parallelizable way to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). These properties make them highly desirable for numerical calculations in relativistic astrophysics and many other fields. The BSSN formulation of the Einstein equations has repeatedly demonstrated its robustness. The formulation is not only stable but allows for puncture-type evolutions of black hole systems. To-date no one has been able to solve the full (3  +  1)-dimensional BSSN equations using DGFE methods. This is partly because DGFE discretization often occurs at the level of the equations, not the derivative operator, and partly because DGFE methods are traditionally formulated for manifestly flux-conservative systems. By discretizing the derivative operator, we generalize a particular flavor of DGFE methods, Local DG methods, to solve arbitrary second-order hyperbolic equations. Because we discretize at the level of the derivative operator, our method can be interpreted as either a DGFE method or as a finite differences stencil with non-constant coefficients.",1

A cubical box of different materials like Al, Fe, Pb, Ag has been placed symmetrically under the particle generation plane between two layers of detection plane. The hit positions on the detectors have been plotted to study the image pattern produced for different materials individually.",1
99084,2,"Dynamics of a Bianchi Type I Model With a Concave Potential In this paper, we study the dynamics of a Bianchi Type I potential in the presence of a concave potential of the form $V(\phi) = V_0 \left[1- \left( \frac{\phi}{\mu}\right)^n\right]$, where $V_0$ is a constant, and $\mu$ is a mass scale. We show that there are two classes of equilibrium points. The first class corresponds to $\phi \neq 0$, $\mu \neq 0$, $n = 0$, and $\dot{\phi} = 0$, which describe expanding and contracting de Sitter universes, for which the shear anisotropy is zero. We show that the expanding de Sitter universe is a local sink of the system, and therefore has associated to it a stable manifold. Thus, orbits will approach this point at late times. In other words, such a model is found to inflate and isotropize at late times as long as $n = 0$. The second class of equilibrium points corresponds to an expanding and contracting anisotropic universe. However, these points are found to emerge only when $n > 1$, $\phi = \dot{\phi} = 0$, which importantly implies that $V = V_0 < 0$ at this point in order to ensure that the square of the shear scalar, $\sigma^2$ is real. Therefore, such equilibrium points correspond to the ekpyrotic cosmological models. Further, we show that for $n = 2$, by Lyapunov's stability theorem, the expanding equilibrium point is asymptotically stable, while for $n > 2$, a two-dimensional stable manifold exists corresponding to the fact that for $n > 2$, such an equilibrium point represents a local sink of the system. Finally, we give a general condition for inflation to occur in this model in terms of the deceleration parameter, and show that the expanding ekpyrotic equilibrium point undergoes the phenomenon of anisotropic inflation if $-3\Lambda/5 < V_0 < 0$, where $\Lambda > 0$ is the cosmological constant.",1
99159,2,Radioactive source deployment system for the calibration of the SuperNEMO detector An automatic source deployment system has been developed to introduce radioactive sources into the SuperNEMO detector for the purpose of calibration. Six plumb bobs are deployed from long wires which contain a number of well characterized sources at specific locations along their lengths. These sources are introduced using six stepper motors in a fully automated process which is both prompt and accurate. The position of each plumb bob is known using laser sensors which can stop the plumb bobs with a precision of 120 μm. Control and monitoring of the system is achieved using a National Instruments compactRIO which allows visual feedback through a graphical interface as well as remote access.,1
99314,2,"Splashback in galaxy clusters as a probe of cosmic expansion and gravity The splashback radius is a physical scale in dark matter halos that is set by the gravitational dynamics of recently accreted shells. We use analytical models and N-body simulations to study the dependence of splashback on dark energy and screened modified gravity theories. In modified gravity models, the transition from screened to unscreened regions typically occurs in the cluster outskirts, suggesting potentially observable signatures in the splashback feature. We investigate the location of splashback in both chameleon and Vainshtein screened models and find significant differences compared with $\Lambda$CDM predictions. We also find an interesting interplay between dynamical friction and modified gravity, providing a distinctive signature for modified gravity models in the behavior of the splashback feature as a function of galaxy luminosity.",1
99322,2,"Distinguishing between Kerr and rotating JNW space-times via frame dragging and tidal effects In this paper, we first investigate some aspects of frame dragging in strong gravity. The computations are carried out for the Kerr black hole and for the rotating Janis-Newman-Winicour solution, that is known to have a naked singularity on a surface at a finite radius. For the Kerr metric, a few interesting possibilities of gyroscope precession frequency, as measured by a Copernican observer outside the ergoregion, are pointed out. It is shown that for certain angular velocities of a stationary observer, this frequency might vanish exactly, close to the ergoregion. Similar computations are repeated for static observers in the naked singularity background, and strong enhancement of the Lense-Thirring precession frequency compared to the black hole case is established. Then, we study the nature of tidal forces in the rotating naked singularity background, in Fermi normal coordinates. Here, physical quantities characterizing tidal disruptions of celestial objects in equatorial circular orbits are computed numerically. Our results here indicate that there might be significant deviations from corresponding Kerr black hole calculations, up to the level of approximation that we consider.",1
99360,2,"Simulating cosmologies beyond $\Lambda$CDM with PINOCCHIO We present a method that extends the capabilities of the PINpointing Orbit-Crossing Collapsed HIerarchical Objects (PINOCCHIO) code, allowing it to generate accurate dark matter halo mock catalogues in cosmological models where the linear growth factor and the growth rate depend on scale. Such cosmologies comprise, among others, models with massive neutrinos and some classes of modified gravity theories. We validate the code by comparing the halo properties from PINOCCHIO against N-body simulations, focusing on cosmologies with massive neutrinos: νΛCDM. We analyse the halo mass function, halo two-point correlation function and halo power spectrum, showing that PINOCCHIO reproduces the results from simulations with the same level of precision as the original code (~ 5–10%). We demonstrate that the abundance of halos in cosmologies with massless and massive neutrinos from PINOCCHIO matches very well the outcome of simulations, and point out that PINOCCHIO can reproduce the Ω(ν)–σ(8) degeneracy that affects the halo mass function. We finally show that the clustering properties of the halos from PINOCCHIO matches accurately those from simulations both in real and redshift-space, in the latter case up to k = 0.3 h Mpc(−)(1). We emphasize that the computational time required by PINOCCHIO to generate mock halo catalogues is orders of magnitude lower than the one needed for N-body simulations. This makes this tool ideal for applications like covariance matrix studies within the standard ΛCDM model but also in cosmologies with massive neutrinos or some modified gravity theories.",1
99398,2,"Optical model potential analysis of $\bar nA$ and $nA$ interactions We use a momentum-dependent optical model potential to analyze the annihilation cross sections of antineutron $\bar n$ on C, Al, Fe, Cu, Ag, Sn, and Pb nuclei for projectile momenta $p_{\rm lab}$ $\lesssim$ 500 MeV/$c$. We obtain good description of annihilation cross sections data of Barbina {\it et al.} [Nucl.~Phys.~A {\bf 612}, ~346~(1997)] and of Astrua {\it et al.} [Nucl.~Phys.~A {\bf 697},~209~(2002)] which exhibit an interesting dependence of the cross sections on the $p_{\rm lab}$ as well as on the target atomic mass number $A$. We also obtain the neutron ($n$) non-elastic reaction cross sections for the same targets. Contrasting the $nA$ reaction cross sections $\sigma^{nA}_{\rm rec}$ to the $\bar nA$ annihilation cross sections $\sigma^{\bar nA}_{\rm ann}$, we find the $\sigma^{\bar nA}_{\rm ann}$ is significantly larger than the $\sigma^{nA}_{\rm rec}$, that is, the $\sigma^{\bar nA}_{\rm ann}$/$\sigma^{nA}_{\rm rec}$ cross section ratio lies between the values of order 1.8 and 3.8 in the momentum region where comparison is possible. The dependence of the annihilation cross section on the projectile charge is also examined in comparison with antiproton $\bar p$. Here we predict the $\bar pA$ annihilation cross section on the simplest assumption that both $\bar pA$ and $\bar nA$ interactions have the same nuclear part of the optical model potential but differs only on the electrostatic Coulomb interaction. Deviation from such simple model extrapolation in measurements will provide new information on the difference between $\bar nA$ and $\bar pA$ potentials.",1
99409,2,"Thermodynamical stability for a perfect fluid According to the maximum entropy principle, it has been proved that the gravitational field equations could be derived by the extrema of the total entropy for a perfect fluid, which implies that thermodynamic relations contain information as regards gravity. In this manuscript, we obtain a criterion for the thermodynamical stability of an adiabatic, self-gravitating perfect fluid system by the second variation of the total entropy. We show, for Einstein’s gravity with spherical symmetry spacetime, that the criterion is consistent with that for the dynamical stability derived by Chandrasekhar and Wald. We also find that the criterion could be applied to cases without spherical symmetry, or under general perturbations. The result further establishes the connection between thermodynamics and gravity.",1
99489,2,"Identity method reexamined This paper discusses the impact of finite particle losses associated with instrumental effects in measurements of moments of produced multiplicities with the identity method towards the evaluation of fluctuation measures such as νdyn. One finds that the identity method remains applicable provided it is modified to determine factorial moments 〈N(N−1)〉, rather than moments 〈N2〉. It is further demonstrated that νdyn remains robust if detection efficiencies are uniform across the measurement's acceptance. The robustness is lost, however, if detection efficiencies are momentum dependent, although the identity method remains applicable provided detection efficiencies can be determined with sufficient accuracy.",1
99613,2,"Rarefied elliptic hypergeometric functions Two exact evaluation formulae for multiple rarefied elliptic beta integrals related to the simplest lens space are proved. They generalize evaluations of the type I and II elliptic beta integrals attached to the root system $C_n$. In a special $n=1$ case, the simplest $p\to 0$ limit is shown to lead to a new class of $q$-hypergeometric identities. Symmetries of a rarefied elliptic analogue of the Euler-Gauss hypergeometric function are described and the respective generalization of the hypergeometric equation is constructed. Some extensions of the latter function to $C_n$ and $A_n$ root systems and corresponding symmetry transformations are considered. An application of the rarefied type II $C_n$ elliptic hypergeometric function to some eigenvalue problems is briefly discussed.",1
99654,2,"Resistive-wall impedances of a thin non-evaporable getter coating on a conductive chamber The resistive-wall impedances of a thin non-evaporable getter (NEG) with constant conductivity coating on a copper chamber are studied in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The copper chamber has a finite thickness and is surrounded by air. As the frequency increases, wake fields see mostly the air first and then the copper chamber next, and then finally the NEG coating. Both longitudinal and transverse impedances slowly undergo transitions from the resistive-wall impedances of the copper-only chamber to those of the NEG-only chamber over a 0.1–100 GHz frequency range. They start to deviate from the conventional impedance lines for the NEG-only chamber at $$\sim$$100 GHz. They increase first to $$\sim$$1 THz and then decrease rapidly as a function of the frequency. Numerical examples of the resistive-wall impedances are presented up to $$\sim$$100 THz using similar parameters to those of the SLS-II (Swiss Light Source) upgrade. We briefly discuss the characteristic of a loss factor for the chamber with NEG coating.",1
99689,2,"Core Structure and Non-Abelian Reconnection of Defects in a Biaxial Nematic Spin-2 Bose-Einstein Condensate We calculate the energetic structure of defect cores and propose controlled methods to imprint a nontrivially entangled vortex pair that undergoes non-Abelian vortex reconnection in a biaxial nematic spin-2 condensate. For a singular vortex, we find three superfluid cores in addition to depletion of the condensate density. These exhibit order parameter symmetries that are different from the discrete symmetry of the biaxial nematic phase, forming an interface between the defect and the bulk superfluid. We provide a detailed analysis of phase mixing in the resulting vortex cores and find an instability dependent upon the orientation of the order parameter. We further show that the spin-2 condensate is a promising system for observing spontaneous deformation of a point defect into an “Alice ring” that has so far avoided experimental detection.",1
99719,2,"A new approach to the connection problem for local solutions to the general Heun equation We present new solution of the the connection problem for local solutions to the general Heun equation. Our approach is based on the symmetric form of the Heun's differential equation \cite{Fiziev14,Fiziev16} with four different regular singular points $z_{1,2,3,4}$. The four special regular points in the complex plane: $Z_{123},Z_{234},Z_{341},Z_{412}$ are the centers of the circles, defined by the different triplets $\{z_k,z_l,z_m\}$ with corresponding different indexes and play fundamental role, since the coefficients of the connection matrix can be expressed using the values of local solutions of the general Heun's equation at these points. A special case when all coefficients can be calculated using only one of the points $Z_{klm}$ is also considered.",1

We discuss its subgap spectrum and study how robust the zero-energy quasiparticles are against the diagonal and off-diagonal disorder. Studying the Z2 topological invariant we show that disorder-induced transition from the topologically nontrivial to trivial phases is manifested by characteristic features in the spatially resolved quasiparticle spectrum at zero energy. We provide evidence for the nonlocal nature of the zero-energy Majorana quasiparticles that are well preserved upon partitioning the chain into separate pieces. Even though the Majorana quasiparticles are not completely immune to inhomogeneity, we show that they can spread onto other (normal) nanoscopic objects via the proximity effect.",1
99731,2,"Model-independent limits and constraints on extended theories of gravity from cosmic reconstruction techniques The onset of dark energy domination depends on the particular gravitational theory driving the cosmic evolution. Model independent techniques are crucial to test the both the present ΛCDM cosmological paradigm and alternative theories, making the least possible number of assumptions about the Universe. In this paper we investigate whether cosmography is able to distinguish between different gravitational theories, by determining bounds on model parameters for three different extensions of General Relativity, namely quintessence, F(𝒯) and f(R) gravitational theories. We expand each class of theories in powers of redshift z around the present time, making no additional assumptions. This procedure is an extension of previous work and can be seen as the most general approach for testing extended theories of gravity through the use of cosmography. In the case of F(𝒯) and f(R) theories, we show that some assumptions on model parameters often made in previous works are superfluous or even unjustified. We use data from the Union 2.1 supernovae catalogue, baryonic acoustic oscillation data and H(z) differential age compilations, which probe cosmology on different scales of the cosmological evolution. We perform a Monte Carlo analysis using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion, reporting 1-σ and 2-σ confidence levels. To do so, we perform two distinct fits, assuming only data within z < 1 first and then without limitations in redshift. We obtain the corresponding numerical intervals in which coefficients span, and find that the data is compatible the ΛCDM limit of all three theories at the 1-σ level, while still compatible with quite a large portion of parameter space. We compare our results to the truncated ΛCDM paradigm, demonstrating that our bounds divert from the expectations of previous works, showing that the permitted regions of coefficients are significantly modified and in general widened with respect to values usually reported in the existing literature. Finally, we test the extended theories through the Bayesian selection criteria AIC and BIC.",1

99750,2,"On the Test of Newton’s Inverse Square Law and Unification of Gravitation and Electromagnetism Newton’s inverse-square law of gravitation is the oldest standing mathematical description of a fundamental interaction. However, both Newton and Einstein failed to explain the Anomaly of the Space-Probes and flybys. Moreover, they also failed to explain experiments on the weight reductions of a charged metal ball, a charged capacitor and heated-up metal. These show that E = mc2 is not valid. To show that the weight reduction is not due to mass reduction, one can measure the acceleration of a neutral object in a free fall. We shall show that the accurate test of Newton’s law is related to the unification of gravitation and electromagnetism that includes the charge-mass interaction and the current-mass interaction. Thus, to have an accurate test of this law, we must understand Einstein’s unification, and exactly how temperature affects the measurement of weight. However, Einstein and his followers failed to show the need of unification due to inadequacy in non-linear mathematics and physics. Also, we point out that the accuracy of the J. Luo Newtonian gravitational constant, needs more work since temperature dependence of gravitation has been verified.",1
99762,2,"Quench absorption coils: a quench protection concept for high-field superconducting accelerator magnets A quench protection concept based on coupled secondary coils is studied for inductively transferring energy out of a quenching superconducting dipole and thus limiting the peak hotspot temperature. So-called ‘quench absorption coils’ are placed in close proximity to the superconducting coils and are connected in series with a diode for the purpose of preventing current transformation during regular operation. During a quench, current is then transformed into the quench absorption coils so that a significant fraction of the stored magnetic energy is dissipated in the these coils. Numerical calculations are performed to determine the impact of such a concept and to evaluate the dimensions of the quench absorption coils needed to obtain significant benefits. A previously constructed 15 T $Nb_{3}Sn$ block coil is taken as a reference layout. Finite-element calculations are used to determine the combined inductive and thermal response of this system and these calculations are validated with a numerical model using an adiabatic approximation. The calculation results indicate that during a quench the presence of the quench absorption coils reduces the energy dissipated in the superconducting coils by 45% and reduces the hotspot temperature by over 100 K. In addition, the peak resistive voltage over the superconducting coils is significantly reduced. This suggests that this concept may prove useful for magnet designs in which the hotspot temperature is a design driver.",1
99763,2,"The Klein–Gordon–Fock equation in the curved spacetime of the Kerr–Newman (anti) de Sitter black hole Exact solutions of the Klein–Gordon–Fock (KGF) general relativistic equation that describe the dynamics of a massive, electrically charged scalar particle in the curved spacetime geometry of an electrically charged, rotating Kerr–Newman–(anti) de Sitter black hole are investigated. In the general case of a rotating, charged, cosmological black hole the solution of the KGF equation with the method of separation of variables results in Fuchsian differential equations for the radial and angular parts which for most of the parameter space contain more than three finite singularities and thereby generalise the Heun differential equations. For particular values of the physical parameters (i.e. mass of the scalar particle) these Fuchsian equations reduce to the case of the Heun equation and the closed form analytic solutions we derive are expressed in terms of Heun functions. For other values of the parameters some of the extra singular points are false singular points. We derive the conditions on the coefficients of the generalised Fuchsian equation such that a singular point is a false point. In such a case the exact solution of the Fuchsian equation can in principle be simplified and expressed in terms of Heun functions. This is the generalisation of the case of a Heun equation with a false singular point in which the exact solution of Heun’s differential equation is expressed in terms of Gauß  hypergeometric function. We also derive the exact solutions of the radial and angular equations for a charged massive scalar particle in the Kerr–Newman spacetime. The analytic solutions are expressed in terms of confluent Heun functions. Moreover, we derived the constraints on the parameters of the theory such that the solution simplifies and expressed in terms of confluent Kummer hypergeometric functions. We also investigate the radial solutions in the KN case in the regions near the event horizon and far from the black hole. Finally, we construct several expansions of the solutions of the Heun equation in terms of generalised hypergeometric functions of Lauricella–Appell.",1

99933,2,"Scale-dependent galaxy bias, CMB lensing-galaxy cross-correlation, and neutrino masses One of the most powerful cosmological datasets when it comes to constraining neutrino masses is represented by galaxy power spectrum measurements, $P_{gg}(k)$. The constraining power of $P_{gg}(k)$ is however severely limited by uncertainties in the modeling of the scale-dependent galaxy bias $b(k)$. In this Letter we present a new method to constrain $b(k)$ by using the cross-correlation between the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing signal and galaxy maps ($C_\ell^{\rm \kappa g}$) using a simple but theoretically well-motivated parametrization for $b(k)$. We apply the method using $C_\ell^{\rm \kappa g}$ measured by cross-correlating Planck lensing maps and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 11 (DR11) CMASS galaxy sample, and $P_{gg}(k)$ measured from the BOSS DR12 CMASS sample. We detect a non-zero scale-dependence at moderate significance, which suggests that a proper modeling of $b(k)$ is necessary in order to reduce the impact of non-linearities and minimize the corresponding systematics. The accomplished increase in constraining power of $P_{gg}(k)$ is demonstrated by determining a 95% C.L. upper bound on the sum of the three active neutrino masses $M_{\nu}$ of $M_{\nu}<0.19\, {\rm eV}$. This limit represents a significant improvement over previous bounds with comparable datasets. Our method will prove especially powerful and important as future large-scale structure surveys will overlap more significantly with the CMB lensing kernel providing a large cross-correlation signal.",1

This method is demonstrated in solving the Dirac equation for a given spherical potential in a 3D lattice space. In comparison with the results obtained by the shooting method, the differences in single-particle energy are smaller than 10−4 MeV, and the densities are almost identical, which demonstrates the high accuracy of the present method.

The very late period of 0≤z≲0.0880, during which the model deviates from the ΛCDM expansion history, is interesting because it causes the current value of the Hubble parameter to be about 4.5% larger than it would be for the ΛCDM model.

Such an mPNS formation is indicated in a recent numerical relativity simulation. We construct steady, spherically symmetric wind solutions with large neutrino luminosities of ∼10^53 erg s^−1 and average energies of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos in the ranges of 9–16 and 11–18 MeV based on the numerical simulation. The winds have much shorter expansion timescale than that of the winds from ordinary PNSs and, depending on the energy of neutrinos, they can be both neutron (n)-rich and proton (p)-rich. In the n-rich wind, the r-process occurs and the abundance distribution of a fiducial wind model gives an approximate agreement with the abundance pattern of a metal-poor weak r star HD 122563, although the third-peak elements are produced only when the antineutrino energy is much larger than the neutrino one. In the p-rich wind, the strong \(\nu \)p-process occurs and A > 100 nuclides are synthesized. In addition, an interesting nucleosynthesis occur in the wind with \(Y_{e}\) ∼ 0.5. In this process, the abundance distribution of heavy nuclei of A > 100 achieves quasi-statistical equilibrium (QSE) at high temperature and the abundance is frozen when the temperature falls.

100233,2,"Thermodynamics of one-dimensional SU(4) and SU(6) fermions with attractive interactions Motivated by advances in the manipulation and detection of ultracold atoms with multiple internal degrees of freedom, we present a finite-temperature lattice Monte Carlo calculation of the density and pressure equations of state, as well as Tan's contact, of attractively interacting SU(4)- and SU(6)-symmetric fermion systems in one spatial dimension. We also furnish a nonperturbative proof of a universal relation whereby quantities computable in the SU(2) case completely determine the virial coefficients of the SU(Nf) case. These one-dimensional systems are appealing because they can be experimentally realized in highly constrained traps and because of the dominant role played by correlations. The latter are typically nonperturbative and are crucial for understanding ground states and quantum phase transitions. While quantum fluctuations are typically overpowered by thermal ones in one and two dimensions at any finite temperature, we find that quantum effects do leave their imprint in thermodynamic quantities. Our calculations show that the additional degrees of freedom, relative to the SU(2) case, provide a dramatic enhancement of the density and pressure (in units of their noninteracting counterparts) in a wide region around vanishing βμ, where β is the inverse temperature and μ the chemical potential. As shown recently in experiments, the thermodynamics we explore here can be measured in a controlled and precise fashion in highly constrained traps and optical lattices.

100338,2,"Testing Gravity Using Galaxy Clusters: New Constraints on Beyond Horndeski Theories The Beyond Horndeski class of alternative gravity theories allow for Self-accelerating de-Sitter cosmologies with no need for a cosmological constant. This makes them viable alternatives to ΛCDM and so testing their small-scale predictions against General Relativity is of paramount importance. These theories generically predict deviations in both the Newtonian force law and the gravitational lensing of light inside extended objects. Therefore, by simultaneously fitting the X-ray and lensing profiles of galaxy clusters new constraints can be obtained. In this work, we apply this methodology to the stacked profiles of 58 high-redshift (0.1 < z < 1.2) clusters using X-ray surface brightness profiles from the XMM Cluster Survey and weak lensing profiles from CFHTLenS. By performing a multi-parameter Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, we are able to place new constraints on the parameters governing deviations from Newton's law Upsilon(1) = −0.11(+0.93)(−)(0.67) and light bending Upsilon(2) = −0.22(+1.22)(−)(1.19). Both constraints are consistent with General Relativity, for which Upsilon(1) = Upsilon(2) = 0. We present here the first observational constraints on Upsilon(2), as well as the first extragalactic measurement of both parameters.",1
100414,2,"New Cavity Techniques and Future Prospects In the recent decades, Superconducting cavities have been widely used to accelerate electron, positron, and ions. Most SRF cavities are made from bulk niobi-um till now, which has developed fast in the past years and is hard to advance more. Take 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavi-ty for example, the quality factor (Q) can keep above 10¹⁰ when the accelerating field (Eacc) reach 40 MV/m, which nearly touch the theoretical limitation of Q and Eacc for bulk niobium. For large superconducting accelerators in future (FCC, CEPC, etc), Q and Eacc should be increased significantly compared to now, which can reduce the cryogenic power and use fewer cavities. So new cavity material and techniques are being studied at accelerator laboratories, while Nitro-gen doping (N-doping) and Nb3Sn have developed quickly and been paid attention to mostly [1]. N-doping can increase Q by one time for 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavity, which have been adopted by Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) at SLAC [2].",1

100623,2,"Development and application of a generic CFD toolkit covering the heat flows in combined solid–liquid systems with emphasis on the thermal design of HiLumi superconducting magnets The main objective of this work is to develop a robust multi-region numerical toolkit for the modeling of heat flows in combined solid–liquid systems. Specifically heat transfer in complex cryogenic system geometries involving super-fluid helium. The incentive originates from the need to support the design of superconductive magnets in the framework of the HiLumi-LHC project (Brüning and Rossi, 2015) [1]. The intent is, instead of solving heat flows in restricted domains, to be able to model a full magnet section in one go including all relevant construction details as accurately as possible. The toolkit was applied to the so-called MQXF quadrupole magnet design. Parametrisation studies were used to find a compromise in thermal design and electro-mechanical construction constraints. The cooling performance is evaluated in terms of temperature margin of the magnets under full steady state heat load conditions and in terms of maximal sustainable load. We also present transient response to pulse heat loads of varying duration and power and the system response to time-varying cold source temperatures.",1
100627,2,"Numerical relativity waveform surrogate model for generically precessing binary black hole mergers A generic, noneccentric binary black hole (BBH) system emits gravitational waves (GWs) that are completely described by seven intrinsic parameters: the black hole spin vectors and the ratio of their masses. Simulating a BBH coalescence by solving Einstein’s equations numerically is computationally expensive, requiring days to months of computing resources for a single set of parameter values. Since theoretical predictions of the GWs are often needed for many different source parameters, a fast and accurate model is essential. We present the first surrogate model for GWs from the coalescence of BBHs including all seven dimensions of the intrinsic noneccentric parameter space. The surrogate model, which we call NRSur7dq2, is built from the results of 744 numerical relativity simulations. NRSur7dq2 covers spin magnitudes up to 0.8 and mass ratios up to 2, includes all ℓ≤4 modes, begins about 20 orbits before merger, and can be evaluated in ∼50  ms. We find the largest NRSur7dq2 errors to be comparable to the largest errors in the numerical relativity simulations, and more than an order of magnitude smaller than the errors of other waveform models. Our model, and more broadly the methods developed here, will enable studies that were not previously possible when using highly accurate waveforms, such as parameter inference and tests of general relativity with GW observations.",1

100804,2,"Cosmological Constant Implementing Mach Principle in General Relativity We consider the fact that noticing on the operational meaning of the physical concepts played an impetus role in the appearance of general relativity (GR). Thus, we have paid more attention to the operational definition of the gravitational coupling constant in this theory as a dimensional constant which is gained through an experiment. However, as all available experiments just provide the value of this constant locally, this coupling constant can operationally be meaningful only in a local area. Regarding this point, to obtain an extension of GR for the large scale, we replace it by a conformal invariant model and then, reduce this model to a theory for the cosmological scale via breaking down the conformal symmetry through singling out a specific conformal frame which is characterized by the large scale characteristics of the universe. Finally, we come to the same field equations that historically were proposed by Einstein for the cosmological scale (GR plus the cosmological constant) as the result of his endeavor for making GR consistent with the Mach principle. However, we declare that the obtained field equations in this alternative approach do not carry the problem of the field equations proposed by Einstein for being consistent with Mach’s principle (i.e., the existence of de Sitter solution), and can also be considered compatible with this principle in the Sciama view.",1
100947,2,"A laser diode based system for calibration of fast time-of-flight detectors A system based on commercially available items, such as a laser diode, emitting in the visible range ~ 400 nm, and multimode fiber patches, fused fiber splitters and optical switches may be assembled, for time calibration of multi-channels time-of-flight (TOF) detectors with photomultipliers' (PMTs') readout. As available laser diode sources have unfortunately limited peak power, the main experimental problem is the tight light power budget of such a system. In addition, while the technology for fused fiber splitters is common in the Telecom wavelength range (λ ~ 850, 1300–1500 nm), it is not easily available in the visible one. Therefore, extensive laboratory tests had to be done on purpose, to qualify the used optical components, and a full scale timing calibration prototype was built. Obtained results show that with such a system, a calibration resolution (σ) in the range 20–30 ps may be within reach. Therefore, fast multi-channels TOF detectors, with timing resolutions in the range 50–100 ps, may be easily calibrated in time. Results on tested optical components may be of interest also for time calibration of different light detection systems based on PMTs, as the ones used for detection of the vacuum ultraviolet scintillation light emitted by ionizing particles in large LAr TPCs.",1
100997,2,"Prescriptions for measuring and transporting local angular momenta in general relativity For observers in curved spacetimes, elements of the dual space of the set of linearized Poincaré transformations from an observer’s tangent space to itself can be naturally interpreted as local linear and angular momenta. We present an operational procedure by which observers can measure such quantities using only information about the spacetime curvature at their location. When applied by observers near spacelike or null infinity in stationary, vacuum, asymptotically flat spacetimes, there is a sense in which the procedure yields the well-defined linear and angular momenta of the spacetime. We also describe a general method by which observers can transport local linear and angular momenta from one point to another, which improves previous prescriptions. This transport is not path independent in general, but becomes path independent for the measured momenta in the same limiting regime. The transport prescription is defined in terms of differential equations, but it can also be interpreted as parallel transport in a particular direct-sum vector bundle. Using the curvature of the connection on this bundle, we compute and discuss the holonomy of the transport law. We anticipate that these measurement and transport definitions may ultimately prove useful for clarifying the physical interpretation of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs charges of asymptotically flat spacetimes.",1

For this purpose we use the basic notions of the calculus of 3-dimensional matrices, define the $\mathbb Z_2$ -graded (or super) structure of a cubic matrix relative to one of the directions of a cubic matrix and the super trace of a cubic supermatrix. Making use of the super trace of a cubic supermatrix we introduce the triple product of cubic supermatrices and find the identities for this triple product, where one of them can be regarded as the analog of ternary associativity. We also show that given a Lie algebra one can construct the n-ary Lie bracket by means of an $(n-2)$ -cochain of given Lie algebra and find the conditions under which this n-ary bracket satisfies the Filippov–Jacobi identity, thereby inducing the structure of n-Lie algebra. We extend this approach to n-Lie superalgebras.",1
101082,2,"New application of superconductors: high sensitivity cryogenic light detectors In this paper we describe the current status of the CALDER project, which is developing ultra-sensitive light detectors based on superconductors for cryogenic applications. When we apply an AC current to a superconductor, the Cooper pairs oscillate and acquire kinetic inductance, that can be measured by inserting the superconductor in a LC circuit with high merit factor. Interactions in the superconductor can break the Cooper pairs, causing sizable variations in the kinetic inductance and, thus, in the response of the LC circuit. The continuous monitoring of the amplitude and frequency modulation allows to reconstruct the incident energy with excellent sensitivity. This concept is at the basis of Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) that are characterized by natural aptitude to multiplexed read-out (several sensors can be tuned to different resonant frequencies and coupled to the same line), resolution of few eV, stable behavior over a wide temperature range, and ease in fabrication. We present the results obtained by the CALDER collaboration with 2×2 cm 2 substrates sampled by 1 or 4 Aluminum KIDs.

101114,2,"Electroweak Decay Studies of Highly Charged Radioactive Ions with TITAN at TRIUMF Several modes of electroweak radioactive decay require an interaction between the nucleus and bound electrons within the constituent atom. Thus, the probabilities of the respective decays are not only influenced by the structure of the initial and final states in the nucleus, but can also depend strongly on the atomic charge. Conditions suitable for the partial or complete ionization of these rare isotopes occur naturally in hot, dense astrophysical environments, but can also be artificially generated in the laboratory to selectively block certain radioactive decay modes. Direct experimental studies on such scenarios are extremely difficult due to the laboratory conditions required to generate and store radioactive ions at high charge states.

101190,2,Scattering cluster wave functions on the lattice using the adiabatic projection method The adiabatic projection method is a general framework for obtaining a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for clusters. Previous studies have used the adiabatic projection method in combination with the finite-volume energy Lüscher’s method to extract scattering phase shifts. We discuss several methods to calculate elastic phase shifts directly from asymptotic cluster wave functions obtained from the effective cluster Hamiltonian for examples in one and three dimensions. This approach is less sensitive than the finite-volume energy Lüscher method to stochastic and systematic errors which appear in the application of the adiabatic projection method.,1

For this particular application, it is shown that a convex optimization problem can be formulated in the H∞ sense to shape the closed-loop FRF while guaranteeing the closed-loop stability. This optimization problem is realized by linearizing a non-convex constraint around a stabilizing operating point.

101336,2,"Real-time dynamics of matrix quantum mechanics beyond the classical approximation We describe a numerical method which allows to go beyond the classical approximation for the real-time dynamics of many-body systems by approximating the many-body Wigner function by the most general Gaussian function with time-dependent mean and dispersion. On a simple example of a classically chaotic system with two degrees of freedom we demonstrate that this Gaussian state approximation is accurate for significantly smaller field strengths and longer times than the classical one. Applying this approximation to matrix quantum mechanics, we demonstrate that the quantum Lyapunov exponents are in general smaller than their classical counterparts, and even seem to vanish below some temperature. This behavior resembles the finite-temperature phase transition which was found for this system in Monte-Carlo simulations, and ensures that the system does not violate the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound λL < 2πT, which inevitably happens for classical dynamics at sufficiently small temperatures.",1

The problem belongs to a family of Fokker-Planck equations with logarithmic potentials closely related to the Bessel process that has been extensively studied for its applications in physics, biology, and finance. The Bessel-like process we consider can be solved by seeking solutions through an expansion into a complete set of eigenfunctions. The associated imaginary-time Schrödinger equation exhibits a mix of discrete and continuous eigenvalue spectra, corresponding to the quantum Coulomb potential describing the bound states of the hydrogen atom.

101572,2,"Modified Newtonian Gravity as an Alternative to the Dark Matter Hypothesis [-5]The applications of Newtonian dynamics in galactic scales have shown that the inverse square law is incompatible with the amount of visible mass in the form of stars and molecular clouds. This manifests as the rotational curves of galaxies being asymptotically flat instead of decaying with the distance to the center of the galaxy. In the context of Newtonian gravity, the standard explanation requires a huge amount of dark mass in the form of hypothetical particles that still remain undetected. A different theory was provided as a modification of Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at low accelerations . This MOND theory still has many supporters and it can easily explain some features of the rotation curves, such as the Tully–Fisher (TF) phenomenological relation between luminosity and velocity. In this paper, we revisit the third approach of a non-Newtonian force, that has resurfaced from time to time, in order to reconcile it with a finite apparent dark mass and the TF relation.",1

101778,2,World-line perturbation theory The motion of a compact body in space and time is commonly described by the world line of a point representing the instantaneous position of the body. In General Relativity such a world-line formalism is not quite straightforward because of the strict impossibility to accommodate point masses and rigid bodies. In many situations of practical interest it can still be made to work using an effective hamiltonian or energy-momentum tensor for a finite number of collective degrees of freedom of the compact object. Even so exact solutions of the equations of motion are often not available. In such cases families of world lines of compact bodies in curved space-times can be constructed by a perturbative procedure based on generalized geodesic deviation equations.

101889,2,"Quantum Entanglement Growth Under Random Unitary Dynamics Characterizing how entanglement grows with time in a many-body system, for example, after a quantum quench, is a key problem in nonequilibrium quantum physics. We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics, representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time-dependent noise or evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for the “entanglement tsunami” in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like (time)1/3 and are spatially correlated over a distance ∝(time)2/3. We derive KPZ universal behavior in three complementary ways, by mapping random entanglement growth to (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface, (ii) a “minimal cut” picture, reminiscent of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography, and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading-order time dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise, allowing us to propose a simple coarse grained minimal cut picture for the entanglement growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary dimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the “velocity” of entanglement growth in the 1D entanglement tsunami. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy entanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a membrane or domain wall by disorder.",1

In addition, we also discuss how the ERE affects the cosmological parameter estimates, and find that the ERE does not impose any significant influences on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r and the neutrino mass at the sensitivities of current experiments. The better CMB polarization data can be used to give a tighter constraint on the ERE and might be important for more precisely constraining cosmological parameters in the future.",1
101933,2,"Bayesian delensing of CMB temperature and polarization We develop the first algorithm able to jointly compute the maximum {\it a posteriori} estimate of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization fields, the gravitational potential by which they are lensed, and cosmological parameters such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. This is an important step towards sampling from the joint posterior probability function of these quantities, which, assuming Gaussianity of the CMB fields and lensing potential, contains all available cosmological information and would yield theoretically optimal constraints. Attaining such optimal constraints will be crucial for next-generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4, where limits on $r$ could be improved by factors of a few over currently used sub-optimal quadratic estimators. The maximization procedure described here depends on a newly developed lensing algorithm, which we term \textsc{LenseFlow}, and which lenses a map by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This description has conceptual advantages, such as allowing us to give a simple non-perturbative proof that the lensing determinant is equal to unity in the weak-lensing regime. The algorithm itself maintains this property even on pixelized maps, which is crucial for our purposes and unique to \textsc{LenseFlow} as compared to other lensing algorithms we have tested. It also has other useful properties such as that it can be trivially inverted (i.e. delensing) for the same computational cost as the forward operation, and can be used to compute lensing adjoint, Jacobian, and Hessian operators. We test and validate the maximization procedure on flat-sky simulations covering up to 600\,deg$^2$ with non-uniform noise and masking.",1
102042,2,"Dark matter halos in the multicomponent model. I. Substructure Multicomponent dark matter with self-interactions, which allows for inter-conversions of species into one another, is a promising paradigm that is known to successfully and simultaneously resolve major problems of the conventional $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at galactic and sub-galactic scales. In this paper, we present $N$-body simulations of the simplest two-component (2cDM) model aimed at studying the distribution of dark matter halos with masses $M\lesssim10^{12}M_\odot$. In particular, we investigate how the maximum circular velocity function of the halos is affected by the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross-sections, $\sigma(v)\propto v^a$, and compare them with available observational data. The results demonstrate that the 2cDM paradigm with the range of self-interaction cross-section per particle mass (evaluated at $v=100$ km s$^{-1}$) of $0.01\lesssim \sigma_0/m\lesssim 1 $ cm$^2$g$^{-1}$ and the mass degeneracy $\Delta m/m\sim 10^{-7}-10^{-8}$ is robustly resolving the substructure and too-big-to-fail problems by suppressing the substructure having small maximum circular velocities, $V_{\rm max}\lesssim100$ km s$^{-1}$. We also discuss the disagreement between the radial distribution of dwarfs in a host halo observed in the Local Group and simulated with CDM. This can be considered as one more small-scale problem of CDM. We demonstrate that such a disagreement is alleviated in 2cDM. Finally, the computed matter power-spectra of the 2cDM structure indicate the model's consistency with the existing Ly-$\alpha$ forest constraints.",1

The performance of the polishing process is affected by bath temperature and fluid dynamics. As part of on-going activities to characterise SUBU, the actual study was done to identify a correlation between the etching rate and physical parameters linked to the bath fluid dynamics. A first approach was made using experimental data from a simplified model setup, transposing them via numerical simulation to a real cavity geometry and verifying the agreement with an experiment in a real size (HIE-ISOLDE) mock-up. In a second approach to improve the accuracy of the calculation, the relation of the measured local etching rates, extracted from the mock-up, to flow dynamics quantities extracted from simulation was investigated. As a result, a correlation between the local etching rate and the turbulence kinetic energy was obtained. This correlation can be exploited to improve the polishing tools and so optimise the current process, as well as to predict the etching rate in other cavity geometries.",1

Disregarding radiation losses, for iron nucleus, a simple estimate gives energies on the order of 10^19 eV for stars with magnetic fields as weak as 10^6 teslas. The proposed mechanism should also work in chance encounters between rapidly moving neutron stars and molecular clouds. The rarity of such encounters may explain the apparent randomness and rarity of the high-energy cosmic ray events.",1
102179,2,"Power-law liquid in cuprate superconductors from fermionic unparticles Recent photoemission spectroscopy measurements (T. J. Reber , arXiv:1509.01611) on cuprate superconductors have inferred that over a wide range of doping, the imaginary part of the electron self-energy scales as Σ″∼(ω2+π2T2)a with a=1 in the overdoped Fermi-liquid state and a<0.5 in the optimal to underdoped regime. We show that this non-Fermi-liquid scaling behavior can naturally be explained by the presence of a scale-invariant state of matter known as unparticles. We evaluate analytically the electron self-energy due to interactions with fermionic unparticles. We find that, in agreement with experiments, the imaginary part of the self-energy scales with respect to temperature and energy as Σ″∼T2+2α and ω2+2α, where α is the anomalous dimension of the unparticle propagator. In addition, the calculated occupancy and susceptibility of fermionic unparticles, unlike those of normal fermions, have significant spectral weights even at high energies. This unconventional behavior is attributed to the branch cut in the unparticle propagator which broadens the unparticle spectral function over a wide energy range and nontrivially alters the scattering phase space by enhancing (suppressing) the intrinsic susceptibility at low energies for negative (positive) α. Our work presents evidence suggesting that unparticles might be important low-energy degrees of freedom in strongly coupled systems such as the cuprate superconductors.",1
102295,2,"The CERN n_TOF facility data acquisition system n_TOF is a pulsed neutron facility at CERN which studies neutron interactions as function of the energy. Neutrons are produced by a pulsed proton beam from the PS directed to a lead target. In a typical experiment, a sample is placed in the neutron beam and the reaction products are recorded. The typical output signals from the n_TOF detectors are characterized by a train of pulses, each one corresponding to a different neutron energy interacting with the sample. The Data Acquisition System (DAQ) has been upgraded in 2014 and is characterized by challenging requirements as more than hundreds of 12 or 14-bit channels at a sampling frequency of 1 GS/s and 1.8 GS/s acquired simultaneously every 1.2 s for up to 100 ms. The amount of data to be managed can reach a peak of several GB/s. This paper describes the hardware's solutions as well as the software's architecture developed to ensure the proper synchronization between all the DAQ machines, the data's integrity, retrieval and analysis. The software modules and tools developed for the monitoring and control of the n_TOF experimental areas and the DAQ operation are also detailed.",1
102398,2,"Quantized Space-Time Structure: The 0-D Point/Twist Void Co-Creator of the Continuum and Single Field A nagging problem has existed in the way we regard the local physical world around us and the non-local universe at large since the very beginning development of our philosophical and scientific attitudes toward the external world. That problem deals with the dualistic way in which we parse the physical world itself through geometry. Geometry can be based upon two different elements: the extension- or metric-element of Riemann and the point-element. Riemannian geometry can be fixed by expanding it to include the point-element, but even that is not enough. A further physical advance can be made by adopting the idea of the 0-D point Void, first developed intuitively by Sperry Andrews, but understanding the physical role of the 0-D point Void can only be realized by expanding that notion by adopting the physical concept of a discrete geometrical point/twist. It is only when a discrete 0-D point/twist Void replaces the simple point-element missing in the Riemannian system of differential geometry of surfaces that post-modern physics fulfills its promise. Understanding the concept of a point-element, of course, is necessary to understand how the Riemannian geometry has been used in general relativity as well as how it can be expanded to unify all of modern physics, including quantum theory, under a single geometrical paradigm. Whether a scientist is considering the discrete point-particles of the Standard Model or the existence of point singularities in relativity theory, the concerns are exactly the same, which forces the concept of an individual 0-D discrete point void to the center of the unification process. In either case, the human Mind and Consciousness are perceiving and interpreting the physical/material world that science is attempting to theoretically describe so the ultimate question of Consciousness and how it interacts with the Mind/brain as well as our commonly experienced physical reality also needs to be answered within the context of the 0-D point/twist. In other words, this is the point (no pun intended) where scientific logic and non-scientific intuition come together to give a complete theoretical structure of our commonly shared physical reality. Toward that end, the only logical scientific precedent to understand anything like the 0-D point/twist in all of the history of science is only found in the notion of a tesseract, which dates from the late nineteenth century attempts to ‘realize’ the concept of a hyperspace in the absence of being able to detect them through astronomical observations so that a hyperspace geometry could be used to explain nature. The end product of understanding these concepts is a greater insight into how the single field theory explains a much wider range of physical phenomena than any single previous paradigm of physics.",1
102491,2,"Design and commissioning of the RIKEN cryogenic electrostatic ring (RICE) A new electrostatic ion storage ring, the RIKEN cryogenic electrostatic ring, has been commissioned with a 15-keV ion beam under cryogenic conditions. The ring was designed with a closed ion beam orbit of about 2.9 m, where the ion beam is guided entirely by electrostatic components. The vacuum chamber of the ring is cooled using a liquid-He-free cooling system to 4.2 K with a temperature difference of 0.4 K at most within all the positions measured by calibrated silicon diode sensors. The first cryogenic operation with a 15-keV Ne+ beam was successfully performed in August 2014. During the measurement, the Ne+ beam was stored under a ring temperature of 4.2 K with a residual-gas lifetime of more than 10 min. This permits an estimation of the residual gas density at a few 104 cm−3, which corresponds to a room-temperature-equivalent pressure of around 1×10−10 Pa. An effect of longitudinal pulse compression at the bunching cavity in the ring was clearly identified by monitoring the pick-up beam detector. The detailed design and mechanical structure of the storage ring, as well as the results from the commissioning run, are reported.",1

102569,2,"On solar system dynamics in general relativity Recent work in the literature has advocated using the Earth–Moon–planetoid Lagrangian points as observables, in order to test general relativity and effective field theories of gravity in the solar system. However, since the three-body problem of classical celestial mechanics is just an approximation of a much more complicated setting, where all celestial bodies in the solar system are subject to their mutual gravitational interactions, while solar radiation pressure and other sources of nongravitational perturbations also affect the dynamics, it is conceptually desirable to improve the current understanding of solar system dynamics in general relativity, as a first step towards a more accurate theoretical study of orbital motion in the weak-gravity regime. For this purpose, starting from the Einstein equations in the de Donder–Lanczos gauge, this paper arrives first at the Levi-Civita Lagrangian for the geodesic motion of planets, showing in detail under which conditions the effects of internal structure and finite extension get canceled in general relativity to first post-Newtonian order. The resulting nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the motion of planets and satellites are solved for the Earth’s orbit about the Sun, written down in detail for the Sun–Earth–Moon system, and investigated for the case of planar motion of a body immersed in the gravitational field produced by the other bodies (e.g. planets with their satellites). At this stage, we prove an exact property, according to which the fourth-order time derivative of the original system leads to a linear system of ordinary differential equations. This opens an interesting perspective on forthcoming research on planetary motions in general relativity within the solar system, although the resulting equations remain a challenge for numerical and qualitative studies. Last, the evaluation of quantum corrections to location of collinear and noncollinear Lagrangian points for the planar restricted three-body problem is revisited, and a new set of theoretical values of such corrections for the Earth–Moon–planetoid system is displayed and discussed. On the side of classical values, the general relativity corrections to Newtonian values for collinear and noncollinear Lagrangian points of the Sun–Earth–planetoid system are also obtained. A direction for future research will be the analysis of planetary motions within the relativistic celestial mechanics set up by Blanchet, Damour, Soffel and Xu.",1

We describe the setup and characterisation of a dedicated low-background screening facility at University College London where we operate an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS. The impact of reagent and carrier gas purity is evaluated and we show that twice-distilled ROMIL-SpA TM -grade nitric acid and zero-grade Ar gas delivers similar sensitivity to ROMIL-UpA TM -grade acid and research-grade gas. A straightforward procedure for sample digestion and analysis of materials with U/Th concentrations down to 10 ppt g/g is presented.

102725,2,"The HII Galaxy Hubble Diagram Strongly Favors $R_{\rm h}=ct$ over $\Lambda$CDM We continue to build support for the proposal to use H ii galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic H ii regions (GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of Type Ia supernovae. Using a sample of 25 high-redshift HIIGx, 107 local HIIGx, and 24 GEHR, we confirm that the correlation between the emission-line luminosity and ionized-gas velocity dispersion is a viable luminosity indicator, and use it to test and compare the standard model ΛCDM and the R_h = ct universe by optimizing the parameters in each cosmology using a maximization of the likelihood function. For the flat ΛCDM model, the best fit is obtained with $$\Omega _{\rm m}= 0.40_{-0.09}^{+0.09}$$. However, statistical tools, such as the Akaike (AIC), Kullback (KIC) and Bayes (BIC) Information Criteria favour R_h = ct over the standard model with a likelihood of ≈94.8–98.8 per cent versus only ≈1.2–5.2 per cent. For wCDM (the version of ΛCDM with a dark-energy equation of state w_de ≡ p_de/ρ_de rather than w_de = w_Λ = −1), a statistically acceptable fit is realized with $$\Omega _{\rm m}=0.22_{-0.14}^{+0.16}$$ and $$w_{\rm de}= -0.51_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$$ which, however, are not fully consistent with their concordance values. In this case, wCDM has two more free parameters than R_h = ct, and is penalized more heavily by these criteria. We find that R_h = ct is strongly favoured over wCDM with a likelihood of ≈92.9–99.6 per cent versus only 0.4–7.1 per cent. The current HIIGx sample is already large enough for the BIC to rule out ΛCDM/wCDM in favour of R_h = ct at a confidence level approaching 3σ.",1
102835,2,"Supercritical instability of Dirac electrons in the field of two oppositely charged nuclei The Dirac equation for an electron in a finite dipole potential has been studied within the method of linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The Coulomb potential of the nuclei that compose a dipole is regularized, by considering the finite nuclear size. It is shown that if the dipole momentum reaches a certain critical value, the novel type of supercriticality occurs; namely, the wave function of the highest occupied electron bound state changes its localization from the negatively charged nucleus to the positively charged one. This phenomenon can be interpreted as a spontaneous creation of an electron-positron pair in vacuum, with each of the created particles being in the bound state with the corresponding nucleus and partially screening it.",1
102936,2,"Accelerating Dark Energy Cosmological Model in Two Fluid with Hybrid Scale Factor In this paper, we have investigated the anisotropic behavior of the accelerating universe in Bianchi V spacetime in the framework of General Relativity (GR). The matter field we have considered is of two non-interacting fluids, i.e. the usual string fluid and dark energy (DE) fluid. In order to represent the pressure anisotropy, the skewness parameters are introduced along three different spatial directions. To achieve a physically realistic solutions to the field equations, we have considered a scale factor, known as hybrid scale factor, which is generated by a time-varying deceleration parameter. This simulates a cosmic transition from early deceleration to late time acceleration. It is observed that the string fluid dominates the universe at early deceleration phase but does not affect nature of cosmic dynamics substantially at late phase, whereas the DE fluid dominates the universe in present time, which is in accordance with the observations results. Hence, we analyzed here the role of two fluids in the transitional phases of universe with respect to time which depicts the reason behind the cosmic expansion and DE. The role of DE with variable equation of state parameter (EoS) and skewness parameters, is also discussed along with physical and geometrical properties.",1

103084,2,"Shadow of rotating regular black holes We study the shadows cast by the different types of rotating regular black holes viz. Ayón-Beato-García (ABG), Hayward, and Bardeen. These black holes have in addition to the total mass (M) and rotation parameter (a), different parameters as electric charge (Q), deviation parameter (g), and magnetic charge (g*). Interestingly, the size of the shadow is affected by these parameters in addition to the rotation parameter. We found that the radius of the shadow in each case decreases monotonically, and the distortion parameter increases when the values of these parameters increase. A comparison with the standard Kerr case is also investigated. We have also studied the influence of the plasma environment around regular black holes to discuss its shadow. The presence of the plasma affects the apparent size of the regular black hole’s shadow to be increased due to two effects: (i) gravitational redshift of the photons and (ii) radial dependence of plasma density.",1

We also derive the Coulomb drag transresistance for double-layer non-Fermi-liquid systems in the hydrodynamic regime. As an example, we consider frictional drag between two quantum Hall states with half-filled lowest Landau levels, each described by a Fermi surface of composite fermions coupled to a U(1) gauge field. We contrast our results to prior calculations of drag of Chern-Simons composite particles and place our findings in the context of available experimental data.",1
103305,2,"Cosmic evolution in the background of non-minimal coupling in $f(R,T,R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ Gravity An accelerated expansion phase is being experienced by the universe due to the presence of an unknown energy component known as dark energy (DE). To find out the cosmic evolution scientists ever tried to modify Einstein's gravitational theory and its unexplored parts. We also look forward to address the same problem with a different approach based on interaction between matter and geometry. For this purpose we consider $f(R,T,Q)$ modified theory (where $R$ is the Ricci Scalar, $T$ is the trace of energy-momentum tensor (EMT) $T_{uv}$ and $Q=R_{uv}T^{uv}$ is interaction of EMT $T_{\mu\nu}$ and Ricci Tensor $R_{uv}$). We formulate modified field equations in the background of Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model which is defined as $ds^2=dt^2-a(t)^2(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 )$, where $a(t)$ represents the scale factor. In this formalism energy density is found using covariant divergence of modified field equations. $\rho$ involves a contribution from non-minimal matter geometry coupling which helps to study different cosmic eras based on equation of state (EOS). Furthermore, we apply the energy bounds to constrain the model parameters establishing a pathway to discuss the cosmic evolution for best suitable parameters in accordance with recent observations.",1
103332,2,"The Linear Point: A cleaner cosmological standard ruler We show how a characteristic length scale imprinted in the galaxy two-point correlation function, dubbed the ""linear point"", can serve as a comoving cosmological standard ruler. In contrast to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation peak location, this scale is constant in redshift and is unaffected by non-linear effects to within $0.5$ percent precision. We measure the location of the linear point in the galaxy correlation function of the LOWZ and CMASS samples from the Twelfth Data Release (DR12) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) collaboration. We combine our linear-point measurement with cosmic-microwave-background constraints from the Planck satellite to estimate the isotropic-volume distance $D_{V}(z)$, without relying on a model-template or reconstruction method. We find $D_V(0.32)=1264\pm 28$ Mpc and $D_V(0.57)=2056\pm 22$ Mpc respectively, consistent with the quoted values from the BOSS collaboration. This remarkable result suggests that all the distance information contained in the baryon acoustic oscillations can be conveniently compressed into the single length associated with the linear point.",1
103440,2,"The Cosmological Models with Jump Discontinuities The article is dedicated to one of the most undeservedly overlooked properties of the cosmological models: the behaviour at, near and due to a jump discontinuity. It is most interesting that while the usual considerations of the cosmological dynamics deals heavily in the singularities produced by the discontinuities of the second kind (a.k.a. the essential discontinuities) of one (or more) of the physical parameters, almost no research exists to date that would turn to their natural extension/counterpart: the singularities induced by the discontinuities of the first kind (a.k.a. the jump discontinuities). It is this oversight that this article aims to amend. In fact, it demonstrates that the inclusion of such singularities allows one to produce a number of very interesting scenarios of cosmological evolution. For example, it produces the cosmological models with a finite value of the equation of state parameter $w=p/\rho$ even when both the energy density and the pressure diverge, while at the same time keeping the scale factor finite. Such a dynamics is shown to be possible only when the scale factor experiences a finite jump at some moment of time. Furthermore, if it is the first derivative of the scale factor that experiences a jump, then a whole new and different type of a sudden future singularity appears. Finally, jump discontinuities suffered by either a second or third derivatives of a scale factor lead to cosmological models experiencing a sudden dephantomization -- or avoiding the phantomization altogether. This implies that theoretically there should not be any obstacles for extending the cosmological evolution beyond the corresponding singularities; therefore, such singularities can be considered a sort of a cosmological phase transition.",1
103464,2,"Teleparallel Conformal Killing Vector Fields of LRS Bianchi Type V Spacetimes in Teleparallel Gravity The aim of this paper is to explore teleparallel conformal Killing vector fields (CKVFs) of locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type V spacetimes in the context of teleparallel gravity and compare the obtained results with those of general relativity (GR). The general solution of teleparallel conformal Killing's equations is found in terms of some unknown functions of t and x, along with a set of integrability conditions. The integrability conditions are solved in some particular cases to get the final form of teleparallel CKVFs. It is observed that the LRS Bianchi type V spacetimes admit proper teleparallel CKVF in only one case, while in remaining cases the teleparallel CKVFs reduce to teleparallel Killing vector fields (KVFs). Moreover, it is shown that the LRS Bianchi type V spacetimes do not admit any proper teleparallel homothetic vector field (HVF).",1
103477,2,"The Extended Stellar Component of Galaxies the Nature of Dark Matter Deep observations of galaxies reveal faint extended stellar components (hereafter ESCs) of streams, shells, and halos. These are a natural prediction of hierarchical galaxy formation, as accreted satellite galaxies are tidally disrupted by their host. We investigate whether or not global properties of the ESC could be used to test of dark matter, reasoning that they should be sensitive to the abundance of low-mass satellites, and therefore the underlying dark matter model. Using cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in the favored Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models (${m}_{{\rm{WDM}}}=0.5,1,2\,{\rm{keV}}/{c}^{2}$), which suppress the abundance of low-mass satellites, we find that the kinematics and orbital structure of the ESC is consistent across models. However, we find striking differences in its spatial structure, as anticipated—a factor of ∼10 drop in spherically averaged mass density between ∼10% and ∼75% of the virial radius in the more extreme WDM runs (${m}_{{\rm{WDM}}}$ = 0.5, 1 ${\rm{keV}}/{c}^{2}$) relative to the CDM run. These differences are consistent with the mass assembly histories of the different components, and are present across redshifts. However, even the least discrepant of the WDM models is incompatible with current observational limits on ${m}_{{\rm{WDM}}}$. Importantly, the differences we observe when varying the underlying dark matter are comparable to the galaxy-to-galaxy variation we expect within a fixed dark matter model. This suggests that it will be challenging to place limits on dark matter using only the unresolved spatial structure of the the ESC.",1

103533,2,"Quantum Origami: Transversal Gates for Quantum Computation and Measurement of Topological Order In topology, a torus remains invariant under certain non-trivial transformations known as modular transformations. In the context of topologically ordered quantum states of matter, these transformations encode the braiding statistics and fusion rules of emergent anyonic excitations and thus serve as a diagnostic of topological order. Moreover, modular transformations of higher genus surfaces, e.g. a torus with multiple handles, can enhance the computational power of a topological state, in many cases providing a universal fault-tolerant set of gates for quantum computation. However, due to the intrusive nature of modular transformations, which abstractly involve global operations and manifold surgery, physical implementations of them in local systems have remained elusive. Here, we show that by folding manifolds, modular transformations can be applied in a single shot by independent local unitaries, providing a novel class of transversal logic gates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Specifically, we demonstrate that multi-layer topological states with appropriate boundary conditions and twist defects allow modular transformations to be effectively implemented by a finite sequence of local SWAP gates between the layers. We further provide methods to directly measure the modular matrices, and thus the fractional statistics of anyonic excitations, providing a novel way to directly measure topological order.",1

This condition leads to relation between metric potentials, which yields a time dependent deceleration parameter. Various physical and geometrical features of the models are also discussed.",1
103836,2,"Rational approximations of $f(R)$ cosmography through Padé polynomials We consider high-redshift f(R) cosmography adopting the technique of polynomial reconstruction. In lieu of considering Taylor treatments, which turn out to be non-predictive as soon as z>1, we take into account the Pad&apos;e rational approximations which consist in performing expansions converging at high redshift domains. Particularly, our strategy is to reconstruct f(z) functions first, assuming the Ricci scalar to be invertible with respect to the redshift z. Having the so-obtained f(z) functions, we invert them and we easily obtain the corresponding f(R) terms. We minimize error propagation, assuming no errors upon redshift data. The treatment we follow naturally leads to evaluating curvature pressure, density and equation of state, characterizing the universe evolution at redshift much higher than standard cosmographic approaches. We therefore match these outcomes with small redshift constraints got by framing the f(R) cosmology through Taylor series around 0z . This gives rise to a calibration procedure with small redshift that enables the definitions of polynomial approximations up to z 10. Last but not least, we show discrepancies with the standard cosmological model which go towards an extension of the ΛCDM paradigm, indicating an effective dark energy term evolving in time. We finally describe the evolution of our effective dark energy term by means of basic techniques of data mining.",1

103859,2,"A Gating Grid Driver for Time Projection Chambers A simple but novel driver system has been developed to operate the wire gating grid of a Time Projection Chamber (TPC). This system connects the wires of the gating grid to its driver via low impedance transmission lines. When the gating grid is open, all wires have the same voltage allowing drift electrons, produced by the ionization of the detector gas molecules, to pass through to the anode wires. When the grid is closed, the wires have alternating higher and lower voltages causing the drift electrons to terminate at the more positive wires. Rapid opening of the gating grid with low pickup noise is achieved by quickly shorting the positive and negative wires to attain the average bias potential with N-type and P-type MOSFET switches. The circuit analysis and simulation software SPICE shows that the driver restores the gating grid voltage to 90% of the opening voltage in less than 0.20 µs, for small values of the termination resistors. When tested in the experimental environment of a time projection chamber larger termination resistors were chosen so that the driver opens the gating grid in 0.35 µs. In each case, opening time is basically characterized by the RC constant given by the resistance of the switches and terminating resistors and the capacitance of the gating grid and its transmission line. By adding a second pair of N-type and P-type MOSFET switches, the gating grid is closed by restoring 99% of the original charges to the wires within 3 µs.",1

The timing resolution was extracted from the time difference with a second calibrated UFSD in coincidence, using the constant fraction method for both.",1
103900,2,Quantisation conditions of the quantum Hitchin system and the real geometric Langlands correspondence Single-valuedness of the eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians is proposed as a natural quantisation condition. Separation of Variables can be used to relate the classification of eigenstates to the classification of projective structures with Fuchsian holonomy. Using complex Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates one may reformulate the quantisation conditions in terms of the generating function for the variety of opers. These results are interpreted as a variant of the geometric Langlands correspondence.,1
103950,2,"Observational properties of massive black hole binary progenitors Context. The first directly detected gravitational waves (GW 150914) were emitted by two coalescing black holes (BHs) with masses of ≈ 36 M⊙ and ≈ 29 M⊙. Several scenarios have been proposed to put this detection into an astrophysical context. The evolution of an isolated massive binary system is among commonly considered models. Aims. Various groups have performed detailed binary-evolution calculations that lead to BH merger events. However, the question remains open as to whether binary systems with the predicted properties really exist. The aim of this paper is to help observers to close this gap by providing spectral characteristics of massive binary BH progenitors during a phase where at least one of the companions is still non-degenerate. Methods. Stellar evolution models predict fundamental stellar parameters. Using these as input for our stellar atmosphere code (Potsdam Wolf-Rayet), we compute a set of models for selected evolutionary stages of massive merging BH progenitors at different metallicities. Results. The synthetic spectra obtained from our atmosphere calculations reveal that progenitors of massive BH merger events start their lives as O2-3V stars that evolve to early-type blue supergiants before they undergo core-collapse during the Wolf-Rayet phase. When the primary has collapsed, the remaining system will appear as a wind-fed high-mass X-ray binary. Based on our atmosphere models, we provide feedback parameters, broad band magnitudes, and spectral templates that should help to identify such binaries in the future. Conclusions. While the predicted parameter space for massive BH binary progenitors is partly realized in nature, none of the known massive binaries match our synthetic spectra of massive BH binary progenitors exactly. Comparisons of empirically determined mass-loss rates with those assumed by evolution calculations reveal significant differences. The consideration of the empirical mass-loss rates in evolution calculations will possibly entail a shift of the maximum in the predicted binary-BH merger rate to higher metallicities, that is, more candidates should be expected in our cosmic neighborhood than previously assumed. Key words: gravitational waves / binaries: close / stars: early-type / stars: atmospheres / stars: winds, outflows / stars: mass-loss",1
104033,2,"Halometry from Astrometry Halometry---mapping out the spectrum, location, and kinematics of nonluminous structures inside the Galactic halo---can be realized via variable weak gravitational lensing of the apparent motions of stars and other luminous background sources. Modern astrometric surveys provide unprecedented positional precision along with a leap in the number of cataloged objects. Astrometry thus offers a new and sensitive probe of collapsed dark matter structures over a wide mass range, from one millionth to several million solar masses. It opens up a window into the spectrum of primordial curvature fluctuations with comoving wavenumbers between $5~\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $10^5~\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, scales hitherto poorly constrained. We outline detection strategies based on three classes of observables---multi-blips, templates, and correlations---that take advantage of correlated effects in the motion of many background light sources that are produced through time-domain gravitational lensing. While existing techniques based on single-source observables such as outliers and mono-blips are best suited for point-like lens targets, our methods offer parametric improvements for extended lens targets such as dark matter subhalos. Multi-blip lensing events may also unveil the existence, location, and mass of planets in the outer reaches of the Solar System, where they would likely have escaped detection by direct imaging.",1
104145,2,"On the existence of stationary Ricci solitons Previously the DeTurck ‘trick’ has been used to render the stationary Einstein’s equation a well posed elliptic system that may be solved numerically by geometric flow or directly. Whilst in the static case for pure gravity with zero or negative cosmological constant there is a simple proof that solving the modified ‘harmonic’ Einstein’s equation leads to a solution of the original Einstein system—i.e. not a Ricci soliton—in the stationary case this argument no longer works. Here we provide a new argument that extends the static result to the case of stationary spacetimes that possess a ‘t-ϕ reflection symmetry. Defining a ‘soliton charge’ from the asymptotic behaviour of the solution, we show that this quantity is always non-positive. Provided asymptotic conditions are chosen such that this charge vanishes, then stationary solitons cannot exist.",1

104205,2,"Underground nuclear astrophysics: why and how The goal of nuclear astrophysics is to measure cross-sections of nuclear physics reactions of interest in astrophysics. At stars temperatures, these cross-sections are very low due to the suppression of the Coulomb barrier. Cosmic-ray-induced background can seriously limit the determination of reaction cross-sections at energies relevant to astrophysical processes and experimental setups should be arranged in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Placing experiments in underground sites, however, reduces this background opening the way towards ultra low cross-section determination. LUNA (Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) was pioneer in this sense. Two accelerators were mounted at the INFN National Laboratories of Gran Sasso (LNGS) allowing to study nuclear reactions close to stellar energies. A summary of the relevant technology used, including accelerators, target production and characterisation, and background treatment is given.",1

104259,2,"Towards a First Precision Measurement of the Mass of the W-Boson with the ATLAS Detector at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV The W boson, being one of the exchange bosons of the weak interaction, is one of the fundamental
particles in the Standard Model of particle physics. The value of its mass cannot
be derived within the framework of the Standard Model; on the contrary, it is one of the free
parameters which have to measured experimentally in order for the Standard Model to make
predictions. Moreover, an experimental determination of the mass of the W boson allows for
a test of the internal consistency of the Standard Model, which is of high importance, since
the Standard Model is expected to be only an effective theory. This means, that beyond a certain
threshold of precision, inconsistencies within the Standard Model are expected to appear,
pointing at a new, underlying theory of broader scope and explanatory power.
A precision measurement of the mass of the W boson is challenging both in terms of modeling
the processes leading to its production, as well as the understanding of the particle detector
with which its decay products are measured.
The ATLAS detector used for this task is one of the most advanced particle detectors
currently in use. It is located at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) close to
Geneva, Switzerland. Supplied by the Large Hadron Collider with proton beams of intensities
and energies never reached before in a laboratory environment, ATLAS detected more than
ten million events containing leptonic decays of W bosons at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV
in the year 2011. This allows for a precise measurement of the mass of the W boson.
Based on a significant sub-set of these events, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
100 pb−1, a first measurement of MW based on muonic W boson decays observed at ATLAS, is
presented in this thesis. The resulting value is MW = 80.380 ± 0.045(stat.) ± 0.021(sys.) GeV.
Apart from the measurement itself, studies necessary for an accurate modeling of the detector
are presented.",1
104269,2,"Stationary Vacuum Black Holes in 5 Dimensions We study the problem of asymptotically flat bi-axially symmetric stationary solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations in $5$-dimensional spacetime. In this setting, the cross section of any connected component of the event horizon is a prime $3$-manifold of positive Yamabe type, namely the $3$-sphere $S^3$, the ring $S^1\times S^2$, or the lens space $L(p,q)$. The Einstein vacuum equations reduce to an axially symmetric harmonic map with prescribed singularities from $\mathbb{R}^3$ into the symmetric space $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/SO(3)$. In this paper, we solve the problem for all possible topologies, and in particular the first candidates for smooth vacuum non-degenerate black lenses are produced. In addition, a generalization of this result is given in which the spacetime is allowed to have orbifold singularities. We also formulate conditions for the absence of conical singularities which guarantee a physically relevant solution.",1
104273,2,"Possibility to probe negative values of a Wigner function in scattering of a coherent superposition of electronic wave packets by atoms Within a plane-wave approximation in scattering, an incoming wave packet’s Wigner function stays positive everywhere, which obscures such purely quantum phenomena as nonlocality and entanglement. With the advent of the electron microscopes with subnanometer-sized beams, one can enter a genuinely quantum regime where the latter effects become only moderately attenuated. Here we show how to probe negative values of the Wigner function in scattering of a coherent superposition of two Gaussian packets with a nonvanishing impact parameter between them (a Schrödinger’s cat state) by atomic targets. For hydrogen in the ground 1s state, a small parameter of the problem, a ratio a/σ⊥ of the Bohr radius a to the beam width σ⊥, is no longer vanishing. We predict an azimuthal asymmetry of the scattered electrons, which is found to be up to 10%, and argue that it can be reliably detected. The production of beams with the not-everywhere-positive Wigner functions and the probing of such quantum effects can open new perspectives for noninvasive electron microscopy, quantum tomography, particle physics, and so forth.",1
104294,2,"Elements of Hilbert Spaces and Operator Theory Algebraic and topological structures compatibly placed on the same underlying set lead to the notions of topological semigroups, groups and vector spaces, among others. It is then natural to consider concepts such as continuous homomorphisms and continuous linear transformations between above-said objects. By an ‘operator’, we mean a continuous linear transformation of a normed linear space into itself. Functional analysis was developed around the turn of the last century by the pioneering work of Banach, Hilbert, von Neumann, Riesz and others. Within a few years, after an amazing burst of activity, it was well developed as a major branch of mathematics. It is a unifying framework for many diverse areas such as Fourier series, differential and integral equations, analytic function theory and analytic number theory. The subject continues to grow and attracts the attention of some of the finest mathematicians of the era. A generalisation of the methods of vector algebra and calculus manifests itself in the mathematical concept of a Hilbert space, named after the celebrated mathe- matician Hilbert. It extends these methods from two-dimensional and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces to spaces with any finite or infinite dimension. These are inner product spaces, which allow the measurement of angles and lengths; once completed, they possess enough limits in the space so that the techniques of analysis can be used. Their diverse applications attract the attention of physicists, chemists and engineers alike in good measure.",1

The front-end unit is a 30-channel circuit board that holds five PSEC4 ASICs, a clock jitter cleaner, and a control FPGA. The analog bandwidth of the front-end signal path is 1.5 GHz. Each channel has an on-chip threshold-level discriminator that is monitored in the FPGA, from which a flexible on-board trigger decision can be formed. To instrument larger channel counts, a `back-end' 6U VME32 control card has been designed. Called the `Central Card', it incorporates an Altera Arria-V FPGA that manages up to 8 front-end cards using one or two CAT5 network cables per board, which transmits the clock and communicates data packets over a custom serial protocol. Data can be read from the Central Card via USB, Ethernet, or dual SFP links, in addition to the VME interface.

104530,2,"The Effect of Modified Gravity on the Odds of the Bound Violations of the Turn-Around Radii The turn-around radii of the galaxy groups show the imprint of a long battle between their self-gravitational forces and the accelerating space. The standard ΛCDM cosmology based on the general relativity (GR) predicts the existence of an upper bound on the expectation value of the turn-around radius that is rarely violated by individual galaxy groups. We speculate that a deviation of the gravitational law from GR on the cosmological scale could cause an appreciable shift of the mean turn-around radius to higher values and make the occurrence of the bound violation more probable. Analyzing the data from high-resolution N-body simulations for two specific models with modified gravity (MG) and the standard GR+ΛCDM cosmology, we determine the turn-around radii of the massive Rockstar groups from the peculiar motions of the galactic halos located in the bound zone where the fifth force generated by MG is expected to be, at most, partially shielded. We detect a $4\sigma $ signal of difference in the odds of the bound violations between a fiducial MG and the GR models, which proves that the odds of the bound violations increase with the strength of the fifth force produced by the presence of MG. The advantage of using the odds of the bound violations as a complementary diagnostics to probe the nature of gravity is discussed.",1

Tensor network representations of the topological defect superselection sectors are constructed for all domain walls. The emergent symmetry-enriched topological order is extracted from these representations, including the symmetry action on the underlying anyons.

In addition to a Fourier analysis, we include the first configuration-space detection, based on the estimators 〈κ_CMBκ_gal〉 and 〈κ_CMBγ_t〉. Combining 747.2 deg^2 from both surveys, we find a detection significance that exceeds 4.2σ in both Fourier- and configuration-space analyses. Scaling the predictions by a free parameter A, we obtain $A^{\rm Planck}_{\rm CFHT}= 0.68\pm 0.31$ and $A^{\rm Planck}_{\rm RCS}= 1.31\pm 0.33$. In preparation for the next generation of measurements similar to these, we quantify the impact of different analysis choices on these results. First, since none of these estimators probes the exact same dynamical range, we improve our detection by combining them. Secondly, we carry out a detailed investigation on the effect of apodization, zero-padding and mask multiplication, validated on a suite of high-resolution simulations, and find that the latter produces the largest systematic bias in the cosmological interpretation. Finally, we show that residual contamination from intrinsic alignment and the effect of photometric redshift error are both largely degenerate with the characteristic signal from massive neutrinos, however the signature of baryon feedback might be easier to distinguish. The three lensing data sets are publicly available.",1

104720,2,"Dynamical evolution of primordial dark matter haloes through mergers Primordial dark matter (DM) haloes are the smallest gravitationally bound DM structures from which the first stars, black holes and galaxies form and grow in the early universe. However, their structures are sensitive to the free streaming scale of DM, which in turn depends on the nature of DM particles. In this work, we test the hypothesis that the slope of the central cusps in primordial DM haloes near the free streaming scale depends on the nature of merging process. By combining and analysing data from a cosmological simulation with the cutoff in the small-scale matter power spectrum as well as a suite of controlled, high-resolution simulations of binary mergers, we find that (1) the primordial DM haloes form preferentially through major mergers in radial orbits; (2) their central DM density profile is more susceptible to a merging process compared to that of galaxy- and cluster-sized DM haloes; (3) consecutive major mergers drive the central density slope to approach the universal form characterized by the Navarro–Frenk–White profile, which is shown to be robust to the impacts of mergers and serves an attractor solution for the density structure of DM haloes. Our work highlights the importance of dynamical processes on the structure formation during the Dark Ages.",1

104882,2,"Weak field equations and generalized FRW cosmology on the tangent Lorentz bundle We study field equations for a weak anisotropic model on the tangent Lorentz bundle TM of a spacetime manifold. A geometrical extension of general relativity (GR) is considered by introducing the concept of local anisotropy, i.e. a direct dependence of geometrical quantities on observer 4−velocity. In this approach, we consider a metric on TM as the sum of an h-Riemannian metric structure and a weak anisotropic perturbation, field equations with extra terms are obtained for this model. As well, extended Raychaudhuri equations are studied in the framework of Finsler-like extensions. Canonical momentum and mass-shell equation are also generalized in relation to their GR counterparts. Quantization of the mass-shell equation leads to a generalization of the Klein–Gordon equation and dispersion relation for a scalar field.

Starting from the explicit construction of the Green (semigroup) theoretical kernel, a theorem linking the integrability conditions and their dependence on the spacetime dimensions is given. Relativistic wave equations with arbitrary spin and the causality problem are discussed with the algebraic interpretation of the radical operator and their relation with coherent and squeezed states. Also we perform by means of pure theoretical procedures (based in physical concepts and symmetry) the relativistic position operator which satisfies the conditions of integrability: it is a non-local, Lorentz invariant and does not have the same problems as the “local”position operator proposed by Newton and Wigner. Physical examples, as zitterbewegung and rogue waves, are presented and deeply analyzed in this theoretical framework.",1
104919,2,"Large-Scale Galaxy Bias This review presents a comprehensive overview of galaxy bias, that is, the statistical relation between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus on large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales, the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion, and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of coefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters . The review begins with a detailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key components of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational observables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical meaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection between bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of galaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics that go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions: primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon–CDM isocurvature perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the description of galaxy bias in the galaxies’ rest frame is related to clustering statistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual galaxy catalogs.",1
104993,2,"Constraints on parameterized dark energy properties from new observations with principal component analysis For dark energy, the equation of state (EoS) is a critical parameter to depict its physical properties. In this paper, we mainly give constraints on the EoS of dark energy w with the latest observations of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) from Planck satellite, JLA Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) sample, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Hubble parameter measurements. We introduce a kind of parameterized dark energy model called “constant bin−w ”, in which the whole redshift range is divided into several bins, and EoS w in each bin is assumed as an independent constant. The results show that EoS in all of the redshift bins are comparable with Λ CDM in the 2 σ confidence regions, but some weak deviations from w=−1 are still indicated. In particular, in the framework of 7 bins, a slight oscillation behavior is shown in the redshift 0 < z < 0.75, especially around the range of 4 th bin (0.25 < z < 0.35) and 5 th bin (0.35 < z < 0.51). Additionally, we adopt the principal component analysis (PCA) method to do the model-independent analysis, which includes normal PCA and localized PCA methods. By implementing so called normal PCA method, the original oscillation behavior of EoS indicated in the framework of 7 bins becomes more significant after the best reconstruction, but such result still supports Λ CDM within the margin of 2 σ errors. To further reduce the errors of constraints on EoS, and confirm such deviations from the cosmological constant scenario, we hope for more precise observational data in the future.",1

These are obtained via a detailed cross-correlation analysis, spanning data from radio to VHE gamma-rays from 2008 to 2015. In addition to that, long-term optical polarisation data is used to aid and complement our physical interpretation of the state and evolution of the source. Blazar studies constitute a clear example that astrophysics is becoming increasingly dominated by “big data”. Specific questions, such as the interpretation of polarimetric information—namely the evolution of the polarisation degree (PD) and specially the polarisation angle (PA) of a source—are very sensitive to the density of data coverage. Improving data accessibility and integration, in order to respond to these necessities, is thus extremely important and has a potentially large impact for blazar science. For this reason, we present also the project to create an open-access database for optical polarimetry, aiming to circumvent the issues raised above, by integrating long-term optical polarisation information on a number sources from several observatories and data providers in a consistent way. The platform, to be launched by the end of 2017 is built as part of the Brazilian Science Data Center (BSDC), a project hosted at CBPF, in Rio de Janeiro, and developed with the support of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and ICRANet.

The effective density matrix obtained by tracing over states containing high-momentum atoms produced by the highly inelastic reactions satisfies the Lindblad equation, with local Lindblad operators that are determined by the anti-Hermitian terms in the effective Hamiltonian.

While many authors demonstrated the objection, our intention is to analyze the properties of Rastall gravity through variation of the Rastall parameter in the context of perfect fluids spheres that may be used to model neutron stars or cold fluid planets. This analysis also serves to counter the claim that Rastall gravity is equivalent to the standard Einstein theory. It turns out that the condition of pressure isotropy is exactly the same as for Einstein gravity and hence that any known solution of the Einstein equations may be used to study the effects of the Rastall dynamical quantities. Moreover, by choosing the well studied Tolman metrics, we discover that in the majority of cases there is substantial deviation from the Einstein case when the Rastall parameter vanishes and in cases where the Einstein model displays defective behaviour, certain Rastall models obey the well known elementary requirements for physical plausibility.",1

The solutions are toroidal and have non-vanishing angular momentum. As one tunes to more relativistic solutions (measured for example by an increasing redshift) there exists a sequence of solutions which approaches the extreme Kerr black hole family. Solutions with angular momentum larger than the square of the mass are also investigated, and in the relativistic limit the near-field geometry of such solutions is observed to become conical in the sense that there is a deficit angle. Such solutions may provide self-consistent models for rotating circular cosmic strings.",1

A unified treatment We apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to the study of light rays in a plasma medium in a static and spherically symmetric gravitational field and also to the study of timelike geodesics followed for test massive particles in a spacetime with the same symmetries. The possibility of using the theorem follows from a correspondence between timelike curves followed by light rays in a plasma medium and spatial geodesics in an associated Riemannian optical metric. A similar correspondence follows for massive particles. For some examples and applications, we compute the deflection angle in weak gravitational fields for different plasma density profiles and gravitational fields.",1
105345,2,"The EBEX Balloon Borne Experiment - Detectors and Readout EBEX was a long-duration balloon-borne experiment to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background. The experiment had three frequency bands operating at 150, 250, and 410 GHz and was the first to use a kilo-pixel array of transition edge sensor bolometers aboard a balloon platform. The array was read out with a frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) system. We describe the design and characterization of the array and the readout system. We give the distributions of measured thermal conductances, normal resistances, and transition temperatures. From the lowest to highest frequency, the median measured average thermal conductances were 39, 53, and 63 pW/K, the medians of transition temperatures were 0.45, 0.48, and 0.47 K, and the medians of normal resistances were 1.9, 1.5, and 1.4 $\Omega$. With the exception of the thermal conductance at 150 GHz, all measured values are within 30\% of their design. We measured median low loop-gain time constants $\tau_0$ = 88, 46, and 57 ms and compare them to predictions. Two measurements of bolometer absorption efficiency gave results consistent within 10% and showing high $\sim$0.9 efficiency at 150 GHz and medium ($\sim$0.35, and $\sim$0.25) at the two higher bands, respectively. We measure a median total optical load of 3.6, 5.3 and 5.0 pW absorbed at the three bands, respectively. EBEX pioneered the use of the digital version of the FDM system. The system multiplexed the bias and readout of 16 bolometers onto two wires. The median noise equivalent temperatures referred to a black body with a temperature of 2.725 K are 400, 920, and 14500 $\mu$K$\sqrt{s}$ for the three bands, respectively. We compare these values to our pre-flight predictions and to a previous balloon payload, discuss the sources of excess noise, and the path for a future payload to make full use of the balloon environment.",1

105418,2,"Solutions of a two-particle interacting quantum walk We study the solutions of the interacting Fermionic cellular automaton introduced in Ref. [Phys Rev A 97, 032132 (2018)]. The automaton is the analogue of the Thirring model with both space and time discrete. We present a derivation of the two-particles solutions of the automaton, which exploits the symmetries of the evolution operator. In the two-particles sector, the evolution operator is given by the sequence of two steps, the first one corresponding to a unitary interaction activated by two-particle excitation at the same site, and the second one to two independent one-dimensional Dirac quantum walks. The interaction step can be regarded as the discrete-time version of the interacting term of some Hamiltonian integrable system, such as the Hubbard or the Thirring model. The present automaton exhibits scattering solutions with nontrivial momentum transfer, jumping between different regions of the Brillouin zone that can be interpreted as Fermion-doubled particles, in stark contrast with the customary momentum-exchange of the one dimensional Hamiltonian systems. A further difference compared to the Hamiltonian model is that there exist bound states for every value of the total momentum, and even for vanishing coupling constant. As a complement to the analytical derivations we show numerical simulations of the interacting evolution.",1
105480,2,"On Kottler's path: origin and evolution of the premetric program in gravity and in electrodynamics In 1922, Kottler put forward the program to remove the gravitational potential, the metric of spacetime, from the fundamental equations in physics as far as possible. He successfully applied this idea to Newton’s gravitostatics and to Maxwell’s electrodynamics, where Kottler recast the field equations in premetric form and specified a metric-dependent constitutive law. We will discuss the basics of the premetric approach and some of its beautiful consequences, like the division of universal constants into two classes. We show that classical electrodynamics can be developed without a metric quite straightforwardly: the Maxwell equations, together with a local and linear response law for electromagnetic media, admit a consistent premetric formulation. Kottler’s program succeeds here without provisos. In Kottler’s approach to gravity, making the theory relativistic, two premetric quasi-Maxwellian field equations arise, but their field variables, if interpreted in terms of general relativity, do depend on the metric. However, one can hope to bring the Kottler idea to work by using the teleparallelism equivalent of general relativity, where the gravitational potential, the coframe, can be chosen in a premetric way.",1

In this paper, we present the different possibilities for estimating and measuring the real neutron fluence received by each Ge wafer irradiated in a thermal neutron reactor. Measurements of their resistivity at 300 K indicate a fluence discrepancy from the expected value and confirm the homogeneity of the doping throughout the volume.

X-rays emitted by pionic carbon via the 4f→3d transition and the parallel 4d→3p transition were observed with a full width at half maximum energy resolution of 6.8 eV at 6.4 keV. The measured X-ray energies are consistent with calculated electromagnetic values which considered the strong interaction effect assessed via the Seki–Masutani potential for the 3p energy level, and favor the electronic population of two filled 1s electrons in the K-shell.

105749,2,"Presymplectic structures and intrinsic Lagrangians It is well-known that a Lagrangian induces a compatible presymplectic form on the equation manifold (stationary surface, understood as a submanifold of the respective jet-space). Given an equation manifold and a compatible presymplectic form therein, we define the first-order Lagrangian system which is formulated in terms of the intrinsic geometry of the equation manifold. It has a structure of a presymplectic AKSZ sigma model for which the equation manifold, equipped with the presymplectic form and the horizontal differential, serves as the target space. For a wide class of systems (but not all) we show that if the presymplectic structure originates from a given Lagrangian, the proposed first-order Lagrangian is equivalent to the initial one and hence the Lagrangian per se can be entirely encoded in terms of the intrinsic geometry of its stationary surface. If the compatible presymplectic structure is generic, the proposed Lagrangian is only a partial one in the sense that its stationary surface contains the initial equation manifold but does not necessarily coincide with it.",1

Our analysis is motivated by a numerical study of the Bose-Hubbard model with an impurity site by Huang et al. [Phys. Rev. B 94, 220502 (2016)1098-012110.1103/PhysRevB.94.220502]; they found an impurity phase transition as a function of the trapping potential, while the bulk was critical. The bulk theory is described by the O(2) symmetric Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory, and we model the impurity by a localized spin-1/2 degree of freedom. We also consider a generalized model by considering an O(N) symmetric bulk theory coupled to a spin-S degree of freedom. We study this field theory using the ε=3−d expansion, where the impurity-bulk interaction flows to an infrared stable fixed point at the critical trapping potential. We determine the scaling dimensions of the impurity degree of freedom and the associated critical exponents near the critical point. We also determine the universal contribution of the impurity to the finite-temperature compressibility of the system at criticality. Our results are compared with numerical simulations.",1

106088,2,"Using Simulations of Black Holes to Study General Relativity and the Properties of Inner Accretion Flow While Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) has been tested extensively in our solar system, it is just beginning to be tested in the strong gravitational fields that surround black holes. As a way to study the behavior of gravity in these extreme environments I have used and added to a ray-tracing code that simulates the X-ray emission from the accretion disks surrounding black holes. In particular, the observational channels which can be simulated include the thermal and reflected spectra, polarization, and reverberation signatures. These calculations can be performed assuming GR as well as four alternative spacetimes. These results can be used to see if it is possible to determine if observations can test the No-Hair theorem of GR which states that stationary, astrophysical black holes are only described by their mass and spin. Although it proves difficult to distinguish between theories of gravity it is possible to exclude a large portion of the possible deviations from GR using observations of rapidly spinning stellar mass black holes such as Cygnus X-1. The ray-tracing simulations can furthermore be used to study the inner regions of black hole accretion flows. I examined the dependence of X-ray reverberation observations on the ionization of the disk photosphere. My results show that X-ray reverberation and X-ray polarization provides a powerful tool to constrain the geometry of accretion disks which are too small to be imaged directly.

The probability is computed rigorously following the von Neumann's fundamental principle of quantum mechanics with an S-matrix that is defined with normalized functions, instead of plane waves. That includes the intriguing correction term to the Fermi's golden rule, in which a visible energy is smaller than the initial energy, and reveals macroscopic quantum phenomena for light particles.

W3 is spatially associated with bright (12)CO (J = 1–0) emission. The gamma-ray emission is spatially correlated with this gas and the SNR. We discuss the possibility that gamma rays originate in interactions between particles accelerated in the SNR and interstellar gas or radiation fields.

LOFT-P requires very large collecting area (>6 m^2, >10x RXTE), high time resolution, good spectral resolution, broad-band spectral coverage (2-30 keV), highly flexible scheduling, and an ability to detect and respond promptly to time-critical targets of opportunity. It addresses science questions such as: What is the equation of state of ultra dense matter? What are the effects of strong gravity on matter spiraling into black holes? It would be optimized for sub-millisecond timing to study phenomena at the natural timescales of neutron star surfaces and black hole event horizons and to measure mass and spin of black holes. These measurements are synergistic to imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy instruments, addressing much smaller distance scales than are possible without very long baseline X-ray interferometry, and using complementary techniques to address the geometry and dynamics of emission regions. A sky monitor (2-50 keV) acts as a trigger for pointed observations, providing high duty cycle, high time resolution monitoring of the X-ray sky with ~20 times the sensitivity of the RXTE All-Sky Monitor, enabling multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies. A probe-class mission concept would employ lightweight collimator technology and large-area solid-state detectors, technologies which have been recently greatly advanced during the ESA M3 study.

However, these electron beam sources need to be understoodand controlled. The focus of this thesis is on electron beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration(PWFA) and the controlled injection and acceleration of secondary electron bunches inthe accelerating wake fields by means of a short-pulse near-infrared laser. Two laser-triggeredinjection methods are explored. The first one is the Trojan Horse Injection, which relies on verygood alignment and timing control between electron beam and laser pulse and then promiseselectron bunches with hitherto unprecedented quality as regards emiance and brightness.The physics of electron injection in the Trojan Horse case is explored with a focus on the finallongitudinal bunch length. Then a theoretical and numerical study is presented that examinesthe physics of Trojan Horse injection when performed in an expanding wake generated by asmooth density down-ramp. The benefits are radically decreased drive-electron bunch requirementsand a unique bunch-length control that enables longitudinal electron-bunch shaping.The second laser-triggered injection method is the Plasma Torch Injection, which is a versatile,all-optical laser-plasma-based method capable to realize tunable density downramp injection.At the SLAC National Laboratory, the first proof-of-principle was achieved both for TrojanHorse and Plasma Torch injection.

In the homogeneous chain limit at μ=1, we find the expected finite-size scaling for the longitudinal impurity magnetization, with no specific scaling for the transverse magnetization. At variance, in the classical impurity limit μ=0, we recover finite scaling for the longitudinal magnetization, while the transverse one basically does not scale. We provide both analytic approximate expressions for the magnetization and the susceptibility as well as numerical evidences for the scaling behavior. At intermediate values of μ, finite-size scaling is violated, and we provide a possible explanation of this result in terms of the appearance of a second, impurity-related length scale. Finally, by going along the standard quantum-to-classical mapping between statistical models, we derive the classical counterpart of the quantum Ising chain with an end-point impurity as a classical Ising model on a square lattice wrapped on a half-infinite cylinder, with the links along the first circle modified as a function of μ.",1

106985,2,"Spatial curvature endgame: Reaching the limit of curvature determination Current constraints on spatial curvature show that it is dynamically negligible: |ΩK|≲5×10-3 (95% C.L.). Neglecting it as a cosmological parameter would be premature however, as more stringent constraints on ΩK at around the 10-4 level would offer valuable tests of eternal inflation models and probe novel large-scale structure phenomena. This precision also represents the “curvature floor,” beyond which constraints cannot be meaningfully improved due to the cosmic variance of horizon-scale perturbations. In this paper, we discuss what future experiments will need to do in order to measure spatial curvature to this maximum accuracy. Our conservative forecasts show that the curvature floor is unreachable—by an order of magnitude—even with Stage IV experiments, unless strong assumptions are made about dark energy evolution and the ΛCDM parameter values. We also discuss some of the novel problems that arise when attempting to constrain a global cosmological parameter like ΩK with such high precision. Measuring curvature down to this level would be an important validation of systematics characterization in high-precision cosmological analyses.",1

107119,2,"Understanding the physical systems from their underlying geometrical and topological properties As it is well known, a certain lack of theoretical understanding of the mechanisms governing the various phenomena exists in several areas of physics. In particular, it concerns those which involve transport of charged particles in low dimensions. In this work the physics of the 2-dimensional charge transport with parallel (in plane) magnetic field is analyzed from the geometrical and algebraic viewpoint making emphasis of how the physical interpretation arises from a consistent mathematical formulation of the problem. As a new result of this investigation with respect to the current literature we explicitly show that: (i) the specific form of the low dimensional Dirac equation enforces the field solution to fulfil the Majorana condition, (ii) the quantum Hall effect is successfully explained, (iii) a new topological effect (as the described by the Aharonov–Casher theorems) is presented and (iv) the link with supersymmetrical models is briefly commented.",1

107146,2,"Study on initial geometry fluctuations via correlation of finite distributions of secondary particles in nucleus-nucleus interactions The study of the peculiarities of the distribution of secondary particles depending on the degree of centrality and the degree of asymmetry of the interacting nuclei, is performed. The number of multicharged fragments of the projectile nucleus (N(f)) in interactions of sharply asymmetric nuclei depends on the centrality degree of interaction. In the majority of peripheral interactions N(f) is equal 1. In the most of the central interactions there are N(f) > 1 or N(f)=0. At that, the events with Nf =1 are separated clearly in the distribution of the total charge of the fragments of a projectile nucleus (Q) depending on the nature of the correlation of the number of fragments of the target nucleus (N(h)) and the multiplicity of secondary particles from interaction area (n(s)). The peak in the field of the maximum values of Q characterizes peripheral events with various degree of the periphery on a growing branch of average N(h-ns) curve. And the peak in the field of small Q characterizes the central events with various degree of centrality on the decreasing branch of average N(h-ns) curve.",1

The generation of relativistic plasma waves by intense lasers or electron beams in low-density plasmas is important in the quest for producing ultra-high acceleration gradients for accelerators. A number of methods are being pursued vigorously to achieve ultra-high acceleration gradients using various plasma wave drivers; these include wakefield accelerators driven byphoton, electron, and ion beams. We describe the basic equations and show how intense beams can generate a large-amplitude relativistic plasma wave capable of accelerating particles to high energies. We also demonstrate how these same relativistic electron waves can accelerate photons in plasmas.",1

Both static and rapidly rotating models are investigated. The results are compared with the General Relativistic results. We found difference between the results in both theories of about 50% for the electromagnetic flux and about 20% in the luminosity for models with equal mass and angular velocity in both theories.

Starting with the effective field theory potential, we apply the stochastic variational method to determine the ground states of nuclei with mass number A≤4. At next-to-next-to-leading order, two out of three independent three-body parameters can be fitted to the three-body binding energies. To fix the remaining one, we look for a simultaneous description of the binding energy of He4 and the charge radii of He3 and He4.

107376,2,Time-Sliced Perturbation Theory II: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Infrared Resummation We use time-sliced perturbation theory (TSPT) to give an accurate description of the infrared non-linear effects affecting the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) present in the distribution of matter at very large scales. In TSPT this can be done via a systematic resummation that has a simple diagrammatic representation and does not involve uncontrollable approximations. We discuss the power counting rules and derive explicit expressions for the resummed matter power spectrum up to next-to leading order and the bispectrum at the leading order. The two-point correlation function agrees well with N-body data at BAO scales. The systematic approach also allows to reliably assess the shift of the baryon acoustic peak due to non-linear effects.,1
107386,2,"Testing dark energy models with $H(z)$ data $Om(z)$ is a diagnostic approach to distinguish dark energy models. However, there are few articles to discuss what is the distinguishing criterion. In this paper, firstly we smooth the latest observational $H(z)$ data using a model-independent method -- Gaussian processes, and then reconstruct the $Om(z)$ and its fist order derivative $\mathcal{L}^{(1)}_m$. Such reconstructions not only could be the distinguishing criteria, but also could be used to estimate the authenticity of models. We choose some popular models to study, such as $\Lambda$CDM, generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP) parametrization. We plot the trajectories of $Om(z)$ and $\mathcal{L}^{(1)}_m$ with $1 \sigma$ confidence level of these models, and compare them to the reconstruction from $H(z)$ data set. The result indicates that the $H(z)$ data does not favor the CPL and JBP models at $1 \sigma$ confidence level. Strangely, in high redshift range, the reconstructed $\mathcal{L}^{(1)}_m$ has a tendency of deviation from theoretical value, which demonstrates these models are disagreeable with high redshift $H(z)$ data. This result supports the conclusions of Sahni et al. \citep{sahni2014model} and Ding et al. \citep{ding2015there} that the $\Lambda$CDM may not be the best description of our universe.",1

The voltage applied to the ionization region of the detector is optimized for stable operation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The energy of a particles from the$^{241}$Am source can be varied by changing the flight path of the a particle from the$^{241}$Am source. The channel numbers of the experimentally-measured pulse peak positions for different energies of the a particles are associated with the energies deposited by the alpha particles in the ionization region of the detector as calculated by using GEANT4 simulations, thus, the energy calibration of the MICROMEGAS detector for a particles is done. For the energy calibration, the thickness of the ionization region is adjusted so that a particles may completely stop in the ionization region and their kinetic energies are fully deposited in the region. The efficiency of our MICROMEGAS detector for a particles under the present conditions is found to be ~97.3%.",1

The background spacetime geometry is defined by the FLRW metric. In the weak gravitational field limit, we develop the first-order scalar and vector cosmological perturbation theory. Our approach works at all cosmological scales (i.e. sub-horizon and super-horizon ones) and incorporates linear and nonlinear effects with respect to energy density fluctuations. We demonstrate that the scalar perturbation (i.e. the gravitational potential) as well as the vector perturbation can be split into individual contributions from each matter source. Each of these contributions satisfies its own equation. The velocity-independent parts of the individual gravitational potentials are characterized by a finite time-dependent Yukawa interaction range being the same for each individual contribution. We also obtain the exact form of the gravitational potential and vector perturbation related to the discrete matter sources. The self-consistency of our approach is thoroughly checked. The derived equations can form the theoretical basis for numerical simulations for a wide class of cosmological models.",1
107636,2,"Confinement and diffusion time-scales of CR hadrons in AGN-inflated bubbles While rich clusters are powerful sources of X-rays, γ-ray emission from these large cosmic structures has not been detected yet. X-ray radiative energy losses in the central regions of relaxed galaxy clusters are so strong that one needs to consider special sources of energy, likely active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, to suppress catastrophic cooling of the gas. We consider a model of AGN feedback that postulates that the AGN supplies the energy to the gas by inflating bubbles of relativistic plasma, whose energy content is dominated by cosmic-ray (CR) hadrons. If most of these hadrons can quickly escape the bubbles, then collisions of CRs with thermal protons in the intracluster medium (ICM) should lead to strong γ-ray emission, unless fast diffusion of CRs removes them from the cluster. Therefore, the lack of detections with modern γ-ray telescopes sets limits on the confinement time of CR hadrons in bubbles and CR diffusive propagation in the ICM.",1

Our experimental data are compared with the corresponding data for other projectiles at the same incident energy.

Specifically, the ($\bar{\rm p},\ \mu^-$,\ p) system is considered. A numerical computation in the framework of a detailed few-body approach is carried out for the following protonium (antiprotonic hydrogen) production three-body reaction: $\bar{\mbox{p}} +(\mbox{p}\mu^-)_{1s} \rightarrow (\bar{\mbox{p}}\rm{p})_{1s} + \mu^-$. Here, p is a proton, $\bar{\mbox{p}}$ is an antiproton, $\mu^-$ is a muon, and a bound state of $\mbox{p}^+$ and its counterpart $\bar{\mbox{p}}$ is protonium: $Pn = (\bar{\mbox{p}}\mbox{p})$. The low-energy cross sections and rates of the $Pn$ formation reaction are computed in the framework of a Faddeev-like equation formalism. The strong $\bar{\mbox{p}}-$p interaction is included in these calculations within a first order approximation. It was found, that the inclusion of this strong interaction results in a quite significant correction to the output of the three-body reaction.

108428,2,"Effects of Tsallis distribution on parametric resonance in chiral phase transitions The parametric resonance was studied in chiral phase transitions when the momentum distribution is described by a Tsallis distribution. A Tsallis distribution has two parameters, the temperature T and the entropic index q. The amplification was estimated in two cases: (1) expansionless case and (2) one-dimensional (1D) expansion case. In an expansionless case, the temperature T is constant, and the amplified modes as a function of T were calculated for various q. In 1D expansion case, the temperature T decreases as a function of the proper time, and the amplification as a function of the transverse momentum was calculated for various q. In the expansionless case, the following facts were found: (1) the larger the value q is, the softer the amplified modes are for the first and second resonance bands, (2) the amplified mode of the first resonance band decreases and vanishes, as the temperature T increases and (3) the amplified mode of the second resonance band decreases and approaches to zero, as the temperature T increases. In 1D expansion case, the following facts were found: (1) the soft mode is amplified, (2) the amplification is extremely strong around the amplified mode of the first resonance band at T = 0 and (3) the magnitude of the amplification as a function of transverse momentum oscillates around the amplified mode of the first resonance band at T = 0.",1

108523,2,"Efficient simulations of large scale structure in modified gravity cosmologies with comoving Lagrangian acceleration We implement an adaptation of the cola approach, a hybrid scheme that combines Lagrangian perturbation theory with an N-body approach, to model nonlinear collapse in chameleon and symmetron modified gravity models. Gravitational screening is modeled effectively through the attachment of a suppression factor to the linearized Klein-Gordon equations. The adapted cola approach is benchmarked, with respect to an N-body code both for the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) scenario and for the modified gravity theories. It is found to perform well in the estimation of the dark matter power spectra, with consistency of 1% to k∼2.5  h/Mpc. Redshift space distortions are shown to be effectively modeled through a Lorentzian parametrization with a velocity dispersion fit to the data. We find that cola performs less well in predicting the halo mass functions but has consistency, within 1σ uncertainties of our simulations, in the relative changes to the mass function induced by the modified gravity models relative to ΛCDM. The results demonstrate that cola, proposed to enable accurate and efficient, nonlinear predictions for ΛCDM, can be effectively applied to a wider set of cosmological scenarios, with intriguing properties, for which clustering behavior needs to be understood for upcoming surveys such as LSST, DESI, Euclid, and WFIRST.",1
108538,2,"Parton theory of magnetic polarons: Mesonic resonances and signatures in dynamics When a mobile hole is moving in an antiferromagnet it distorts the surrounding Néel order and forms a magnetic polaron. Such interplay between hole motion and antiferromagnetism is believed to be at the heart of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. In this article, we study a single hole described by the t-Jz model with Ising interactions between the spins in two dimensions. This situation can be experimentally realized in quantum gas microscopes with Mott insulators of Rydberg-dressed bosons or fermions, or using polar molecules. We work at strong couplings, where hole hopping is much larger than couplings between the spins. In this regime we find strong theoretical evidence that magnetic polarons can be understood as bound states of two partons, a spinon and a holon carrying spin and charge quantum numbers, respectively. Starting from first principles, we introduce a microscopic parton description which is benchmarked by comparison with results from advanced numerical simulations. Using this parton theory, we predict a series of excited states that are invisible in the spectral function and correspond to rotational excitations of the spinon-holon pair. This is reminiscent of mesonic resonances observed in high-energy physics, which can be understood as rotating quark-antiquark pairs carrying orbital angular momentum. Moreover, we apply the strong-coupling parton theory to study far-from-equilibrium dynamics of magnetic polarons observable in current experiments with ultracold atoms. Our work supports earlier ideas that partons in a confining phase of matter represent a useful paradigm in condensed-matter physics and in the context of high-temperature superconductivity in particular. While direct observations of spinons and holons in real space are impossible in traditional solid-state experiments, quantum gas microscopes provide a new experimental toolbox. We show that, using this platform, direct observations of partons in and out of equilibrium are now possible. Extensions of our approach to the t-J model are also discussed. Our predictions in this case are relevant to current experiments with quantum gas microscopes for ultracold atoms.",1

108599,2,Exactly solvable quantum impurity model with inverse-square interactions We construct an exactly solvable quantum impurity model consists of spin-1/2 conduction fermions and spin-1/2 magnetic moments. The ground-state wave function is a homogeneous Jastrow type polynomial and the parent Hamiltonian has nearest-neighbor hopping terms between the conduction fermions and inverse-square spin-exchange terms between the conduction fermions and the magnetic moments. The spin-spin correlation function between the conduction fermions and the magnetic moments and the low-lying energy levels of the parent Hamiltonian demonstrate that our model captures essential aspects of the spin-1/2 Kondo problem. The low-energy physics of our model is described by a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) and a particular correlator of this CFT reproduces the ground-state wave function. This connection paves the way toward constructing more exactly solvable quantum impurity models using boundary CFT.,1

When the critical point is approached from the crossover side, negative fourth-order magnetic susceptibility is observable. It is also demonstrated that non-monotonic behavior occurs in the temperature dependence of the generalized susceptibilities of the energy.

We describe the vapor diffusion process used to fabricate this material in the most successful experiments, and we compare the differences in the process used at different labs. We overview results of Nb3Sn SRF coatings, including CW and pulsed measurements of cavities as well as microscopic measurements. We discuss special considerations that must be practised when using Nb3Sn cavities in applications. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the state-of-the-art and describing the outlook for this alternative SRF material.",1
109158,2,"An Introduction to Clifford Algebras and Spinors This text explores how Clifford algebras and spinors have been sparking a collaboration and bridging a gap between Physics and Mathematics. This collaboration has been the consequence of a growing awareness of the importance of algebraic and geometric properties in many physical phenomena, and of the discovery of common ground through various touch points: relating Clifford algebras and the arising geometry to so-called spinors, and to their three definitions (both from the mathematical and physical viewpoint). The main point of contact are the representations of Clifford algebras and the periodicity theorems. Clifford algebras also constitute a highly intuitive formalism, having an intimate relationship to quantum field theory. The text strives to seamlessly combine these various viewpoints and is devoted to a wider audience of both physicists and mathematicians.

Among the existing approaches to Clifford algebras and spinors this book is unique in that it provides a didactical presentation of the topic and is accessible to both students and researchers. It emphasizes the formal character and the deep algebraic and geometric completeness, and merges them with the physical applications. The style is clear and precise, but not pedantic. The sole pre-requisites is a course in Linear Algebra which most students of Physics, Mathematics or Engineering will have covered as part of their undergraduate studies.",1
109162,2,"Gravitational rotation of polarization: Clarifying the gauge dependence and prediction for a double pulsar From the basic concepts of general relativity, we investigate the rotation of the polarization angle by a moving gravitational lens. In particular, we clarify the existing confusion in the literature by showing and explaining why such rotation must explicitly depend on the relative motion between the observer and the lens. We update the prediction of such effect on the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 and estimate a rotation angle of ∼10-7rad. Despite its tiny signal, this is 10 orders of magnitude larger than the previous prediction by Ruggiero and Tartaglia [1], which apparently was misguided by the confusion in the literature.",1
109247,2,"Automated Optical Inspection and Image Analysis of Superconducting Radio-Frequency Cavities The inner surface of superconducting cavities plays a crucial role to achieve highest accelerating fields and low losses. For an investigation of this inner surface of more than 100 cavities within the cavity fabrication for the European XFEL and the ILC HiGrade Research Project, an optical inspection robot OBACHT was constructed. To analyze up to 2325 images per cavity, an image processing and analysis code was developed and new variables to describe the cavity surface were obtained. The accuracy of this code is up to 97 % and the positive predictive value (PPV) 99 % within the resolution of 15.63 μm. The optical obtained surface roughness is in agreement with standard profilometric methods. The image analysis algorithm identified and quantified vendor specific fabrication properties as the electron beam welding speed and the different surface roughness due to the different chemical treatments. In addition, a correlation of ρ = −0.93 with a significance of 6 σ between an obtained surface variable and the maximal accelerating field was found.",1

109446,2,"Test of the Einstein equivalence principle with spectral distortions in the cosmic microwave background The Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) can be verified by the measurement of the spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). One of the consequences of the EEP on cosmological scales is the energy independency of the cosmological redshift effect. We propose a new test of the energy independency of the redshift effect by the measurement of the spectral distortion of CMB. In general relativity, the energy independency of the redshift effect is ensured by the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric which does not depend on energy. We show that the CMB spectral distortions arise when the FRW metric has the energy dependence. Assuming the simple energy-dependent form of the FRW metric, we evaluate the CMB distortions. From the COBE/FIRAS bound, we find that the deviation degree from the EEP is, at least, less than 10-5 at the CMB energy scales.",1
109504,2,"Linking gamma-ray spectra of supernova remnants to the cosmic ray injection properties in the aftermath of supernovae The acceleration times of the highest-energy particles, which emit gamma-rays in young and middle-age supernova remnants (SNRs), are comparable with SNR age. If the number of particles starting acceleration was varying during early times after the supernova explosion then this variation should be reflected in the shape of the gamma-ray spectrum. We use the solution of the non-stationary equation for particle acceleration in order to analyse this effect. As a test case, we apply our method to describe gamma-rays from IC 443. As a proxy of the IC 443 parent supernova we consider SN1987A. First, we infer the time dependence of injection efficiency from evolution of the radio spectral index in SN1987A. Then, we use the inferred injection behaviour to fit the gamma-ray spectrum of IC 443. We show that the break in the proton spectrum needed to explain the gamma-ray emission is a natural consequence of the early variation of the cosmic ray injection, and that the very-high-energy gamma rays originate from particles which began acceleration during the first months after the supernova explosion. We conclude that the shape of the gamma-ray spectrum observed today in SNRs critically depends on the time variation of the cosmic ray injection process in the immediate post-explosion phases. With the same model, we also estimate the future possibility of detecting gamma-rays from SN 1987A. Key words: ISM: supernova remnants / supernovae: general / gamma rays: ISM / cosmic rays",1
109518,2,"Manifestations of geometric phases in a proton electric-dipole-moment experiment in an all-electric storage ring We consider a proton electric-dipole-moment experiment in an all-electric storage ring when the spin is frozen and local longitudinal and vertical electric fields alternate. In this experiment, the geometric (Berry) phases are very important. Due to the these phases, the spin rotates about the radial axis. The corresponding systematic error is rather important while it can be canceled with clockwise and counterclockwise beams. The geometric phases also lead to the spin rotation about the radial axis. This effect can be canceled with clockwise and counterclockwise beams as well. The sign of the azimuthal component of the angular velocity of the spin precession depends on the starting point where the spin orientation is perfect. The radial component of this quantity keeps its value and sign for each starting point. When the longitudinal and vertical electric fields are joined in the same sections without any alternation, the systematic error due to the geometric phases does not appear but another systematic effect of the spin rotation about the azimuthal axis takes place. It has opposite signs for clockwise and counterclockwise beams.",1

The same principle can also be used to model the inverse square law of gravity, and predicts the mass of the electron.",1
109654,2,"Extra-Acceleration at Large Scale due to Merging at Small Scales Merging of cosmic objects at small scales is regarded as a possible source for explaining the extra-acceleration of the universe at large scale. Inspired by chemical association, merging of cosmic objects introduces a correction term in the perfect fluid equation of state in the form of $P=w\rho+b\rho^2$. Alternative relations for the energy density and scale factor evolution in the FRLW framework are obtained that coincide with the conventional results in the perfect fluid limit. Invoking the observational constraint for the equation of state parameter $w$ and the deceleration parameter, we show that the simultaneous merging of cosmic objects such as galaxies on one hand and voids on the other, will act as a source of extra-accelerating in the universe at large scale.",1
109657,2,"The evolution of hyperboloidal data with the dual foliation formalism: Mathematical analysis and wave equation tests A long-standing problem in numerical relativity is the satisfactory treatment of future null-infinity. We propose an approach for the evolution of hyperboloidal initial data in which the outer boundary of the computational domain is placed at infinity. The main idea is to apply the ‘dual foliation’ formalism in combination with hyperboloidal coordinates and the generalized harmonic gauge formulation. The strength of the present approach is that, following the ideas of Zenginoğlu, a hyperboloidal layer can be naturally attached to a central region using standard coordinates of numerical relativity applications. Employing a generalization of the standard hyperboloidal slices, developed by Calabrese et al, we find that all formally singular terms take a trivial limit as we head to null-infinity. A byproduct is a numerical approach for hyperboloidal evolution of nonlinear wave equations violating the null-condition. The height-function method, used often for fixed background spacetimes, is generalized in such a way that the slices can be dynamically ‘waggled’ to maintain the desired outgoing coordinate lightspeed precisely. This is achieved by dynamically solving the eikonal equation. As a first numerical test of the new approach we solve the 3D flat space scalar wave equation. The simulations, performed with the pseudospectral bamps code, show that outgoing waves are cleanly absorbed at null-infinity and that errors converge away rapidly as resolution is increased.",1
109707,2,"Cauchy horizon stability in a collapsing spherical dust cloud. II: Energy bounds for test fields and odd-parity gravitational perturbations We analyze the stability of the Cauchy horizon associated with a globally naked, shell-focussing singularity arising from the complete gravitational collapse of a spherical dust cloud. In a previous work, we have studied the dynamics of spherical test scalar fields on such a background. In particular, we proved that such fields cannot develop any divergences which propagate along the Cauchy horizon. In the present work, we extend our analysis to the more general case of test fields without symmetries and to linearized gravitational perturbations with odd parity. To this purpose, we first consider test fields possessing a divergence-free stress-energy tensor satisfying the dominant energy condition, and we prove that a suitable energy norm is uniformly bounded in the domain of dependence of the initial slice. In particular, this result implies that free-falling observers co-moving with the dust particles measure a finite energy of the field, even as they cross the Cauchy horizon at points lying arbitrarily close to the central singularity. Next, for the case of Klein–Gordon fields, we derive point-wise bounds from our energy estimates which imply that the scalar field cannot diverge at the Cauchy horizon, except possibly at the central singular point. Finally, we analyze the behaviour of odd-parity, linear gravitational and dust perturbations of the collapsing spacetime. Similarly to the scalar field case, we prove that the relevant gauge-invariant combinations of the metric perturbations stay bounded away from the central singularity, implying that no divergences can propagate in the vacuum region. Our results are in accordance with previous numerical studies and analytic work in the self-similar case.",1
109713,2,"Microwave accelerating structures: an innovative parallel coupled electron LINAC Particle accelerators are employed in many fields of the physics, engineering and medicine science. Although the idea of acceleration of charged particles by means of time varying electromagnetic field is an almost century old, the research and development in this field is active more than ever. An efficient particle accelerator gives the opportunity to reach energy levels not yet achieved and allows the study of the deepest laws of the physics. Also a better performance of the particle accelerators is desirable in order to develop compact table-top machine for medical or industrial purpose. The work here presented takes place in this framework. A parallel coupled electron LINAC has been studied for high gradient operation in the X-band frequency. This kind of device can address some issues of high gradient accelerating LINAC. Due to decoupled propagation axes for RF power and beam it is possible to increase the structure shunt impedance without affecting the cell to cell coupling, combining the advantages of travelling and standing wave structures. Besides in case of a breakdown only the energy stored in one cell is involved in the discharge process and not the total energy stored of the section, thus the damages caused by the breakdown event are expected to be smaller. Following a discussion on how the proposed configuration was conceived, full wave simulations were carried out to numerically validate the idea and to optimize the single cell in order to minimize the probability of breakdowns. After a successful cold simulation a beam dynamics analysis has been done in order to estimate the properties of the beam moving inside the device. Due to the small irises dimension the transverse wakefield can be source of instability for the bunch propagation. Therefore this issue has been investigated by means of numerical methods. Finally, the problem of the beam alignment with respect to the accelerating section is addressed and the results of a device suitable to beam position measurement are presented.",1

109763,2,"Spin-SILC: CMB polarization component separation with spin wavelets We present Spin-SILC, a new foreground component separation method that accurately extracts the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization E and B modes from raw multifrequency Stokes Q and U measurements of the microwave sky. Spin-SILC is an internal linear combination method that uses spin wavelets to analyse the spin-2 polarization signal P = Q + iU. The wavelets are additionally directional (non-axisymmetric). This allows different morphologies of signals to be separated and therefore the cleaning algorithm is localized using an additional domain of information. The advantage of spin wavelets over standard scalar wavelets is to simultaneously and self-consistently probe scales and directions in the polarization signal P = Q + iU and in the underlying E and B modes, therefore providing the ability to perform component separation and E–B decomposition concurrently for the first time. We test Spin-SILC on full-mission Planck simulations and data and show the capacity to correctly recover the underlying cosmological E and B modes. We also demonstrate a strong consistency of our CMB maps with those derived from existing component separation methods. Spin-SILC can be combined with the pseudo- and pure E–B spin wavelet estimators presented in a companion paper to reliably extract the cosmological signal in the presence of complicated sky cuts and noise. Therefore, it will provide a computationally efficient method to accurately extract the CMB E and B modes for future polarization experiments.",1

109909,2,"Constraining Gamma-Ray Emission from Luminous Infrared Galaxies with Fermi-LAT; Tentative Detection of Arp 220 Star-forming galaxies produce gamma-rays primarily via pion production, resulting from inelastic collisions between cosmic-ray protons and the interstellar medium (ISM). The dense ISM and high star formation rates of luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) imply that they should be strong gamma-ray emitters, but so far only two LIRGs have been detected. Theoretical models for their emission depend on the unknown fraction of cosmic-ray protons that escape these galaxies before interacting. We analyze Fermi-LAT data for 82 of the brightest Infrared Astronomical Satellite LIRGs and ULIRGs. We examine each system individually and carry out a stacking analysis to constrain their gamma-ray fluxes. We report the detection of the nearest ULIRG Arp 220 (∼4.6σ). We observe a gamma-ray flux (0.8–100 GeV) of 2.4 × 10(−)(10) phot cm(−)(2) s(−)(1) with a photon index of 2.23 (8.2 × 10(41) erg s(−)(1) at 77 Mpc). We also derive upper limits (ULs) for the stacked LIRGs and ULIRGs. The gamma-ray luminosity of Arp 220 and the stacked ULs agree with calorimetric predictions for dense star-forming galaxies. With the detection of Arp 220, we extend the gamma-ray–IR luminosity correlation to the high-luminosity regime with $\mathrm{log}{L}_{0.1-100\mathrm{GeV}}=1.25\times \mathrm{log}{L}_{8-1000\mu {\rm{m}}}+26.7$ as well as the gamma-ray–radio continuum luminosity correlation with $\mathrm{log}{L}_{0.1-100\mathrm{GeV}}=1.22\times \mathrm{log}{L}_{1.4\mathrm{GHz}}+13.3$.

110141,2,"$A$-dependence of quasielastic charged-current neutrino-nucleus cross sections Background: C12 has been and is still widely used in neutrino-nucleus scattering and oscillation experiments. More recently, Ar40 has emerged as an important nuclear target for current and future experiments. Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) possess various advantages in measuring electroweak neutrino-nucleus cross sections. Concurrent theoretical research is an evident necessity. Purpose: Ar40 is larger than C12, and one expects nuclear effects to play a bigger role in reactions. We present inclusive differential and total cross section results for charged-current neutrino scattering on Ar40 and perform a comparison with C12, O16, and Fe56 targets, to find out about the A-dependent behavior of model predictions. Method: Our model starts off with a Hartree-Fock description of the nucleus, with the nucleons interacting through a mean field generated by an effective Skyrme force. Long-range correlations are introduced by means of a continuum random phase approximation approach. Further methods to improve the accuracy of model predictions are also incorporated in the calculations. Results: We present calculations for C12, O16, Ar40, and Fe56, showcasing differential cross sections over a broad range of kinematic values in the quasielastic regime. We furthermore show flux-folded results for Ar40 and we discuss the differences between nuclear responses. Conclusions: At low incoming energies and forward scattering we identify an enhancement in the Ar40 cross section compared to C12, as well as in the high ω (low Tμ) region across the entire studied Eν range. The contribution to the folded cross section of the reaction strength at values of ω lower than 50 MeV for forward scattering is sizable.",1
110145,2,"Emergent gravity in galaxies and in the Solar System It was recently proposed that the effects usually attributed to particle dark matter on galaxy scales are due to the displacement of dark energy by baryonic matter, a paradigm known as emergent gravity. This formalism leads to predictions similar to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in spherical symmetry, but not quite identical. In particular, it leads to a well defined transition between the Newtonian and the modified gravitational regimes, a transition depending on both the Newtonian acceleration and its first derivative with respect to radius. Under the hypothesis of the applicability of this transition to aspherical systems, we investigate whether it can reproduce observed galaxy rotation curves. We conclude that the formula leads to marginally acceptable fits with strikingly low best-fit distances, low stellar mass-to-light ratios, and a low Hubble constant. In particular, some unobserved wiggles are produced in rotation curves because of the dependence of the transition on the derivative of the Newtonian acceleration, leading, even in the most favorable case, to systematically less good fits than MOND. Then, applying the predicted transition from emergent gravity in a regime where it should a priori be applicable, i.e. in spherical symmetry and outside of the bulk of matter, we show that the predictions for the secular advances of Solar System planets’ perihelia are discrepant with the data by seven orders of magnitude, ruling out the present emergent gravity weak-field formula with high confidence.",1
110181,2,"Using Sloppy Models for Constrained Emittance Minimization at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) In order to minimize the emittance at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), we measure and correct the orbit, dispersion, and transverse coupling of the beam.* However, this method is limited by finite measurement resolution of the dispersion, and so a new procedure must be used to further reduce the emittance due to dispersion. In order to achieve this, we use a method based upon the theory of sloppy models.** We use a model of the accelerator to create the Hessian matrix which encodes the effects of various corrector magnets on the vertical emittance. A singular value decomposition of this matrix yields the magnet combinations which have the greatest effect on the emittance. We can then adjust these magnet ‘‘knobs'' sequentially in order to decrease the dispersion and the emittance.

The theory involves an infinite number of bosonic fields arising from bosonizing the fluctuations of the shape of the composite Fermi surface. At zero momentum there are O(N) neutral excitations, each carrying a well-defined spin that runs integer values 2,3,…. The mixing of modes at nonzero momentum q leads to the characteristic bending down of the lowest excitation and the appearance of the magnetoroton minima. A purely algebraic argument shows that the magnetoroton minima are located at qℓB=zi/(2N+1), where ℓB is the magnetic length and zi are the zeros of the Bessel function J1, independent of the microscopic details. We argue that these minima are universal features of any two-dimensional Fermi surface coupled to a gauge field in a small background magnetic field.",1

Within the Monte Carlo approach we are able to estimate uncertainties of three-nucleon observables arising from the imprecise knowledge of the One-Pion-Exchange Gaussian potential parameters. We found that the uncertainties of this type are small for three-nucleon elastic scattering cross section at investigated here energies up to the nucleon laboratory energy of 200 MeV. They remain smaller than the dominant theoretical uncertainty arising from using various models of nucleon-nucleon interactions.

110470,2,"Probing the small-scale structure in strongly lensed systems via transdimensional inference Strong lensing is a sensitive probe of the small-scale density fluctuations in the Universe. We implement a pipeline to model strongly lensed systems using probabilistic cataloging, which is a transdimensional, hierarchical, and Bayesian framework to sample from a metamodel (union of models with different dimensionality) consistent with observed photon count maps. Probabilistic cataloging allows one to robustly characterize modeling covariances within and across lens models with different numbers of subhalos. Unlike traditional cataloging of subhalos, it does not require model subhalos to improve the goodness of fit above the detection threshold. Instead, it allows the exploitation of all information contained in the photon count maps—for instance, when constraining the subhalo mass function. We further show that, by not including these small subhalos in the lens model, fixed-dimensional inference methods can significantly mismodel the data. Using a simulated Hubble Space Telescope data set, we show that the subhalo mass function can be probed even when many subhalos in the sample catalogs are individually below the detection threshold and would be absent in a traditional catalog. The implemented software, Probabilistic Cataloger (PCAT) is made publicly available at https://github.com/tdaylan/pcat.",1
110487,2,"Graphical and Theoretical Approach of Thermodynamics in Cyclic Theory of Universe In cyclic theory of universe the scenario is just inverse of the theory of inflation. The cyclic theory model almost solves the problem of homogeneity, isotropy and flatness. It also has relevant cause and effect scenarios of different phenomenon like reheating, contraction of branes and it also shows the thermodynamic relevance. The basic approach of the paper is to satisfy the thermodynamics laws and to formulate the situation of ultimate fate of universe. Each and every phenomena that has been described in cyclic theory of universe has been taken into account while drawing the hypothetical graphs of thermodynamics. While treating thermodynamics with cosmology and astrophysics, many factors have been neglected like shape of universe, the cosmological constant, invariant scalar factor and factors related to the depth of cosmology. The paper also shows the behaviour of pressure, volume and temperature by using arbitrary values. The time and space has been neglected in graphical representation.",1
110506,2,"Effects of Fallback Accretion on Protomagnetar Outflows in Gamma-Ray Bursts and Superluminous Supernovae Rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized protoneutron stars (“millisecond protomagnetars”) are candidate central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), and binary neutron star mergers. Magnetar birth may be accompanied by the fallback of stellar debris, lasting for seconds or longer following the explosion. Accretion alters the magnetar evolution by (1) providing an additional source of rotational energy (or a potential sink, if the propeller mechanism operates), (2) enhancing the spin-down luminosity above the dipole rate by compressing the magnetosphere and expanding the polar cap region of open magnetic field lines, and (3) supplying an additional accretion-powered neutrino luminosity that sustains the wind baryon loading, even after the magnetar’s internal neutrino luminosity has subsided. The more complex evolution of the jet power and magnetization of an accreting magnetar more readily accounts for the high 56Ni yields of GRB SNe and the irregular time evolution of some GRB light curves (e.g., bursts with precursors followed by a long quiescent interval before the main emission episode). Additional baryon loading from accretion-powered neutrino irradiation of the polar cap lengthens the time frame over which the jet magnetization is in the requisite range σ ≲ 103 for efficient gamma-ray emission, thereby accommodating GRBs with ultralong durations. Though accretion does not significantly raise the maximum energy budget from the limit of ≲ few × 1052 erg for an isolated magnetar, it greatly expands the range of magnetic field strengths and birth spin periods capable of powering GRB jets, reducing the differences between the magnetar properties normally invoked to explain GRBs versus SLSNe.",1
110521,2,"A test of general relativity using the LARES and LAGEOS satellites and a GRACE Earth gravity model We present a test of general relativity, the measurement of the Earth’s dragging of inertial frames. Our result is obtained using about 3.5 years of laser-ranged observations of the LARES, LAGEOS, and LAGEOS 2 laser-ranged satellites together with the Earth gravity field model GGM05S produced by the space geodesy mission GRACE. We measure $\mu = (0.994 \pm 0.002) \pm 0.05$ , where $\mu $ is the Earth’s dragging of inertial frames normalized to its general relativity value, 0.002 is the 1-sigma formal error and 0.05 is our preliminary estimate of systematic error mainly due to the uncertainties in the Earth gravity model GGM05S.

110540,2,"Enhanced nuclear spin dependent parity violation effects using the $^{199}$HgH molecule Electron interactions with the nuclear-spin-dependent (NSD) parity non-conserving (PNC) anapole moment are strongly enhanced within heteronuclear diatomic molecules. A novel, low-energy optical rotation experiment is being proposed with the aim of observing NSD PNC interactions in HgH. Based on the relativistic coupled cluster method we present a complete calculation of the circular polarization parameter $P = 2\,\textrm{Im}(E1_{PNC})/M1 \approx 3 \times 10^{-6}\; \kappa$ for the $^2\Sigma_{1/2} \to ^2\Pi_{1/2}$ optical transition of HgH, where $\kappa$ is a dimensionless constant determined by the nuclear anapole moment. This provides an improvement in sensitivity to NSD PNC by 2 -- 3 orders of magnitude over the leading atomic Xe, Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi optical rotation experiments, and shows that the proposed measurement will be sensitive enough to extract the $^{199}$Hg anapole moment and shed light on the underlying theory of hadronic parity violation.",1

110733,2,"Motion of half-spin particles in the axially symmetric field of naked singularities of the static q-metric Quantum-mechanical motion of a spin-half particle is examined in the axially symmetric fields of static naked singularities formed by a mass distribution with a quadrupole moment (q-metric). The analysis is performed by means of the method of effective potentials of the Dirac equation generalized to the case where radial and angular variables are not separated. If −1 < q < qlim, |qlim| ≪ 1, where q is the quadrupolemoment in proper units, the naked singularities do not exclude the existence of stationary bound states of Dirac particles for a prolate mass distribution in the q-metric along the axial axis. For an oblate mass distribution, the naked singularities of the q-metric are separated from a Dirac particle by infinitely large repulsive barriers followed by a potential well which deepens while moving apart from the equator (from θ = θ$_{min}$ or θ = π − θ$_{min}$) toward the poles. The poles make an exception, and at 0 < q < q*, there are some points θ$_{i}$ for particle states with j ≥ 3/2.",1

Euclid will explore the expansion history of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and red-shifts of galaxies as well as the distribution of clusters of galaxies over a large fraction of the sky. Although the main driver for Euclid is the nature of dark energy, Euclid science covers a vast range of topics, from cosmology to galaxy evolution to planetary research. In this review we focus on cosmology and fundamental physics, with a strong emphasis on science beyond the current standard models. We discuss five broad topics: dark energy and modified gravity, dark matter, initial conditions, basic assumptions and questions of methodology in the data analysis. This review has been planned and carried out within Euclid’s Theory Working Group and is meant to provide a guide to the scientific themes that will underlie the activity of the group during the preparation of the Euclid mission.",1

We start from a Euclidean current-current correlator and extract σ(ω) from Green-Kubo relations using the Backus-Gilbert method. Calculations were performed both for long-range interactions and taking into account only the contact term. In both cases we vary interaction strength and study its influence on optical conductivity. We compare our results with previous theoretical calculations choosing ω≈κ, thus working in the region of the plateau in σ(ω) which corresponds to optical conductivity of Dirac quasiparticles. No dependence of optical conductivity on interaction strength is observed unless we approach the antiferromagnetic phase transition in the case of an artificially enhanced contact term. Our results strongly support previous theoretical studies that claimed very weak regularization of graphene conductivity.",1

Firstly, in the $f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$ model space with jj44b effective interaction along with isospin projection, DSM is used to describe the structure of the recently observed low-lying $T=0$ and $T=1$ bands in the heavy odd-odd N=Z nucleus $^{66}$As. DSM results are close to the data and also to the shell model results. For the $T=1$ band, DSM predicts structural change at $8^+$ just as in the shell model. In addition, the lowest two $T=0$ bands are found to have quasi-deuteron structure above a $^{64}$Ge core and the $5^+$ and $9^+$ levels of the third $T=0$ band are found to be isomeric states.

111276,2,"Ab initio Calculations of the Isotopic Dependence of Nuclear Clustering Nuclear clustering describes the appearance of structures resembling smaller nuclei such as alpha particles (He4 nuclei) within the interior of a larger nucleus. In this Letter, we present lattice Monte Carlo calculations based on chiral effective field theory for the ground states of helium, beryllium, carbon, and oxygen isotopes. By computing model-independent measures that probe three- and four-nucleon correlations at short distances, we determine the shape of the alpha clusters and the entanglement of nucleons comprising each alpha cluster with the outside medium. We also introduce a new computational approach called the pinhole algorithm, which solves a long-standing deficiency of auxiliary-field Monte Carlo simulations in computing density correlations relative to the center of mass. We use the pinhole algorithm to determine the proton and neutron density distributions and the geometry of cluster correlations in C12, C14, and C16. The structural similarities among the carbon isotopes suggest that C14 and C16 have excitations analogous to the well-known Hoyle state resonance in C12.",1

(Phys. Rev. D 84:024020, 2011). For a specific choice of $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ where $f(T)=-\lambda T$ , two solutions of the modified gravity field equations have been generated with the help of a variation law between the expansion anisotropy ( ${\sigma}/{\theta}$ ) and the scale factor ( $S$ ), together with a general non-linear equation of state. The solution for $m\neq3$ corresponds to singular model of the universe whereas the solution for $m=3$ represents a non-singular model.

111316,2,"Leptonic and Lepto-Hadronic Modeling of the Nov. 2010 flare from 3C 454.3 In this study, we use a one-zone leptonic and a lepto-hadronic model to investigate the multi-wavelength emission and the prominent flare of the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 454.3 in Nov 2010. We perform a parameter study with both models to obtain broadband fits to the spectral energy distribution of 3C 454.3. Starting with the baseline parameters obtained from the fits, we then investigate different flaring scenarios for both models to explain an extreme outburst and spectral hardening of 3C 454.3 that occurred in Nov 2010. We find that the one zone lepto-hadronic model can successfully explain both the broadband multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution and light curves in the optical R, Swift XRT and Fermi gamma-ray bandpasses for 3C 454.3 during quiescence and the peak of the Nov. 2010 flare.

These boundary terms are dependent on what one fixes on the boundary and in particular on spacetime dimensions as well. Following recent works of Padmanabhan we will introduce two new variables to describe general relativity and the action principle with these new dynamical variables will turn out to be well posed. Then we will connect these dynamical variables and boundary term obtained thereof to existing literature and shall comment on a few properties of Einstein–Hilbert action which might have been unnoticed earlier in the literature. Before concluding with future prospects and discussions, we will perform a general analysis of the boundary term of Einstein–Hilbert action for null surfaces as well.",1

General theory of wave propagation through SPP of order n is presented and the reflection and transmission coefficients are derived in their closed analytical form by transfer matrix formulation. We present scattering features of super periodic rectangular potential and super periodic delta potential as special cases of SPP. It is found that the symmetric self-similarity is the special case of super periodicity. Thus by identifying a symmetric fractal potential as special cases of SPP, one can obtain the tunnelling amplitude for a particle from such fractal potential.

111435,2,"Learning to Classify from Impure Samples A persistent challenge in practical classification tasks is that labelled training sets are not always available. In particle physics, this challenge is surmounted by the use of simulations. These simulations accurately reproduce most features of data, but cannot be trusted to capture all of the complex correlations exploitable by modern machine learning methods. Recent work in weakly supervised learning has shown that simple, low-dimensional classifiers can be trained using only the impure mixtures present in data. Here, we demonstrate that complex, high-dimensional classifiers can also be trained on impure mixtures using weak supervision techniques, with performance comparable to what could be achieved with pure samples. Using weak supervision will therefore allow us to avoid relying exclusively on simulations for high-dimensional classification. This work opens the door to a new regime whereby complex models are trained directly on data, providing direct access to probe the underlying physics.",1
111468,2,"X-ray Intraday Variability of Five TeV Blazars with NuSTAR We have examined 40 Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) light curves (LCs) of five TeV emitting high synchrotron peaked blazars: 1ES 0229+200, Mrk 421, Mrk 501, 1ES 1959+650, and PKS 2155−304. Four of the blazars showed intraday variability in the NuSTAR energy range of 3–79 keV. Using an autocorrelation function analysis we searched for intraday variability timescales in these LCs and found indications of several between 2.5 and 32.8 ks in eight LCs of Mrk 421, a timescale around 8.0 ks for one LC of Mrk 501, and timescales of 29.6 and 57.4 ks in two LCs of PKS 2155-304. The other two blazars’ LCs do not show any evidence for intraday variability timescales shorter than the lengths of those observations, however, the data were both sparser and noisier for them. We found positive correlations with zero lag between soft (3–10 keV) and hard (10–79 keV) bands for most of the LCs, indicating that their emissions originate from the same electron population. We examined spectral variability using a hardness ratio analysis and noticed a general “harder-when-brighter” behavior. The 22 LCs of Mrk 421 observed between 2012 July and 2013 April show that this source was in a quiescent state for an extended period of time and then underwent an unprecedented double-peaked outburst while monitored on a daily basis during 2013 April 10–16.

111631,2,"Space charge effects on the third order coupled resonance The effect of space charge on bunched beams has been the subject of numerous numerical and experimental studies in the first decade of 2000. Experimental campaigns performed at the CERN Proton Synchrotron in 2002 and at the GSI SIS18 in 2008 confirmed the existence of an underlying mechanism in the beam dynamics of periodic resonance crossing induced by the synchrotron motion and space charge. In this article we present an extension of the previous studies to describe the effect of space charge on a controlled coupled (2D) third order resonance. The experimental and simulation results of this latest campaign shed a new light on the difficulties of the 2D particle dynamics. We find striking experimental evidence that space charge and the coupled resonance create an unusual coupling in the phase space, leading to the formation of an asymmetric halo. Moreover, this study demonstrates a clear link between halo formation and fixed-lines.",1
111640,2,"Pure E and B polarization maps via Wiener filtering In order to draw scientific conclusions from observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization, it is necessary to separate the contributions of the E and B components of the data. For data with incomplete sky coverage, there are ambiguous modes, which can be sourced by either E or B signals. Techniques exist for producing “pure” E and B maps, which are guaranteed to be free of cross-contamination, although the standard method, which involves constructing an eigenbasis, has a high computational cost. We show that such pure maps can be thought of as resulting from the application of a Wiener filter to the data. This perspective leads to far more efficient methods of producing pure maps. Moreover, by expressing the idea of purification in the general framework of Wiener filtering (i.e., maximization of a posterior probability), it leads to a variety of generalizations of the notion of pure E and B maps, e.g., accounting for noise or other contaminants in the data as well as correlations with temperature anisotropy.",1

111699,2,"Competing orders and topology in the global phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates Strong electronic interactions and spin-orbit coupling can be conducive for realizing novel broken symmetry phases supporting quasiparticles with nontrivial band topology. 227 pyrochlore iridates provide a suitable material platform for studying such emergent phenomena where both topology and competing orders play important roles. In contrast to the most members of this material class, which are thought to display “all-in–all-out” (AIAO) type magnetically ordered low-temperature insulating ground states, Pr2Ir2O7 remains metallic while exhibiting “spin-ice” (SI) correlations at low temperatures. Additionally, this is the only 227 iridate compound, which exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) along the [1,1,1] direction below 1.5 K, without possessing any measurable magnetic moment. By focusing on the normal state of 227 iridates, described by a parabolic semimetal with quadratic band touching, we use renormalization group analysis, mean-field theory, and phenomenological Landau theory as three complementary methods to construct a global phase diagram in the presence of generic local interactions among itinerant electrons of Ir ions. While the global phase diagram supports several competing multipolar orders, motivated by the phenomenology of 227 iridates we particularly emphasize the competition between AIAO and SI orders and how it can cause a mixed phase with “three-in–one-out” (3I1O) spin configurations. In terms of topological properties of Weyl quasiparticles of the 3I1O state, we provide an explanation for the magnitude and the direction of the observed AHE in Pr2Ir2O7. We propose a strain-induced enhancement of the onset temperature for AHE in thin films of Pr2Ir2O7 and additional experiments for studying competing orders in the vicinity of the metal-insulator transition. In addition to providing a theory for competing orders and magnetic properties of Pr2Ir2O7, the theoretical framework developed in this work should also be useful for a better understanding of competing multipolar orders in other correlated materials.",1
111720,2,"Very Strong and Supercool Electroweak Phase Transitions The aim of this work is to determine whether any zero temperature features of the scalar
potential strongly influence the finite temperature properties of the electroweak phase
transition. In particular, we address whether one can get an arbitrarily strong phase
transition from zero temperature effects.
We investigate a variety of models of varying complexity. For the models we look
into, we successfully determine that the vacuum energy difference at zero temperature
has a direct influence on the critical temperature. This leads to arbitrarily strong phase
transitions, subject to the caveat that sliding behaviour does not occur. What we call
sliding behaviour is the scenario in which the broken vacuum destabilises under thermal
corrections before reaching the critical temperature. The parameter subspace in which
sliding behaviour does occur often leads to significantly weakened phase transitions.
For a more detailed investigation of the phase transition one must look at the thermal
decay of the false vacuum. Choosing a non-supersymmetric real singlet extension to the
Standard Model, called the xSM, we detail by example how one can systematically investigate
some non-trivial phase transition properties. The specific model we adopt is the
$Z_2$xSM which has a $Z_2$ discrete symmetry imposed on the singlet as well as the Higgs
field. We focus on the non-sliding parameter subspace, which has a minimal zero temperature
parameter space of only three free parameters. For this setup, the depth of the
potential at zero temperature has a one-to-one mapping with the strength of the phase
transition at critical temperature so we can trivially choose the strength. This allows for
a systematic approach to investigating very strong phase transitions and their connection
to the amount of supercooling, latent heat, bubble nucleation rate, and a hydrodynamical
friction parameter. We also trace out the parameter region in which runaway bubbles are
expected and discuss the implications for gravitational wave production.",1

We find that (1) the difference between the vorticity of baryonic matter and that of dark matter is evident on the scales of < 0.2 h −1 Mpc; (2) the vorticity of baryonic matter exhibits a stronger correlation with the tensor of velocity shear than the vorticity of dark matter does; and (3) the spinning direction of small-mass dark matter halos tends to be parallel to the direction of their host filaments, while the spinning direction of massive dark matter halos tends to be perpendicular to the direction of their host filaments, and the intensity of this kind correlation depends on the size of simulation box, and the simulation accuracy. These factors may cause the relationship between the the spins of dark matter halos and those of galaxies to be complicated, and affect the correlation between the galaxy spins and the nearby large-scale structures.",1
111758,2,"The Search for the Standard Model Production of Four Top Quarks The Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics has been incredibly successful and accurate in
describing the fundamental particles that make up the world around us and the way they behave.
However, we know it is not the ultimate theory of nature as some phenomena remain
unexplained. Outstanding questions include what is dark matter, this mysterious material which
can be inferred from observations of the universe but has not been directly detected; and where
does gravity fit into the picture? These questions motivate our search for physics Beyond the
Standard Model (BSM) at the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN research facility. Here we
accelerate protons around a 27 km ring and collide them at four experiments located underground.
When we collide protons we effectively collide the more fundamental particles within
the protons, quarks and gluons. This thesis focuses on research undertaken at the CMS experiment
studying the heaviest quarks, top quarks, which are not found in nature but instead are
produced in high-energy experiments. Top quarks are most often produced in pairs, however,
this thesis focuses on the search for the simultaneous production of four top quarks, which is an
incredibly rare process in comparison. A precision measurement of this rare process would be a
stringent test on the SM and may give hints of physics beyond the standard model. Untangling
the signal of four-top-quark production from the overwhelming background of top-quark-pair
production in the output of the detector is incredibly difficult. Algorithms, which are often
used in developing artificial intelligence, are therefore employed to exploit subtle differences in
signatures, greatly increasing the sensitivity. Results are presented which place tight limits on
the rate of four-top-quark production and projections of the future sensitivity are made. This
includes an estimate of when CMS will have sufficient data to definitively observe this process
at SM rates. The results also allow us to place constraints on properties of hypothesised BSM
particles. Here we interpret the results to place constraints on the mass and top quark-coupling
of one such particle, the sgluon.",1

They are shown to duly stem from the linearization of the characteristic distribution of a presymplectic structure refining the original one of Souriau. In this model, once specialized to the case of a static electric-like field, the angular momentum and energy given by the associated moment map now correctly restore the spin–orbit coupling term.

111835,2,"Numerical and analytical solutions of Neutrino-Dominated Accretion Flows with a Non-Zero Torque Boundary Condition and its applications in Gamma-ray Bursts A stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) has been discussed in a number of works as the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It is widely believed that NDAF cannot liberate enough energy for bright GRBs. However, these works have been based on the assumption of a “no torque” boundary condition, which is invalid when the disk is magnetized. In this paper, we present both numerical and analytical solutions for NDAFs with non-zero boundary stresses and reexamine their properties. We find that an NDAF with such a boundary torque can be powerful enough to account for those bright short GRBs, energetic long GRBs, and ultra-long GRBs. The disk becomes viscously unstable, which makes it possible to interpret the variability of GRB prompt emission and the steep decay phase in the early X-ray afterglow. Finally, we study the gravitational waves radiated from a processing BH-NDAF. We find that the effects of the boundary torque on the strength of the gravitational waves can be ignored.",1

111880,2,"Physical viability of fluid spheres satisfying the Karmarkar condition We obtain a new static model of the TOV equation for an anisotropic fluid distribution by imposing the Karmarkar condition. In order to close the system of equations we postulate an interesting form for the $g_{rr}$ gravitational potential, which allows us to solve for $g_{tt}$ metric component via the Karmarkar condition. We demonstrate that the new interior solution has well-behaved physical attributes and can be utilized to model relativistic static fluid spheres. By using observational data sets for the radii and masses for compact stars such as 4U 1538-52, LMC X-4, and PSR J1614-2230 we show that our solution describes these objects to a very good degree of accuracy. The physical plausibility of the solution depends on a parameter c for a particular star. For 4U 1538-52, LMC X-4, and PSR J1614-2230 the solutions are well behaved for $0.1574 \le c \le 0.46$ , $0.1235 \le c \le 0.35$ and $0.05 \le c \le 0.13$ , respectively. The behavior of the thermodynamical and physical variables of these compact objects leads us to conclude that the parameter c plays an important role in determining the equation of state of the stellar material and observed that smaller values of c lead to stiffer equation of states.",1
111882,2,"Using the tilted flat-$\Lambda$CDM and the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM inflation models to measure cosmological parameters from a compilation of observational data We use the physically-consistent tilted spatially-flat and non-flat $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ inflation models to constrain cosmological parameter values with the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and recent Type Ia supernovae measurements, baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, growth rate observations, and Hubble parameter measurements. The most dramatic consequence of including the four non-CMB data sets is the significant strengthening of the evidence for non-flatness in the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model, from 1.8$\sigma$ for the CMB data alone to 5.1$\sigma$ for the full data combination. The BAO data is the most powerful of the non-CMB data sets in more tightly constraining model parameter values and in favoring a spatially-closed Universe in which spatial curvature contributes about a percent to the current cosmological energy budget. The non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model better fits the large-angle CMB anisotropy angular spectrum and is more consistent with the Dark Energy Survey constraints on the current value of the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) as a function of the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter ($\Omega_m$) but does not provide as good a fit to the smaller-angle CMB anisotropy data as does the tilted flat-$\Lambda$CDM model.

111941,2,"Power Spectra Based Planck Constraints on Compensated Isocurvature, and Forecasts for LiteBIRD and CORE Space Missions Compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIP), where the primordial baryon and cold dark matter density perturbations cancel, do not cause total matter isocurvature perturbation. Consequently, at the linear order in the baryon density contrast Δ, a mixture of CIP and the adiabatic mode leads to the same CMB spectra as the pure adiabatic mode. Only recently, Muñoz et al. showed that at the second order CIP leaves an imprint in the observable CMB by smoothing the power spectra in a similar manner as lensing. This causes a strong degeneracy between the CIP variance Δ(rms)(2) ≡ langleΔ(2)rangle and the phenomenological lensing parameter A(L). We study several combinations of the Planck 2015 data and show that the measured lensing potential power spectrum C(ℓ)phiphi breaks the degeneracy. Nested sampling of the ΛCDM+Δ(rms)(2)(+A(L)) model using the Planck 2015 temperature, polarization, and lensing data gives Δ(rms)(2) = (6.9(+3.0)(−)(3.1)) × 10(−)(3) at 68% CL. A non-zero value is favoured at 2.3σ (or without the polarization data at 2.8σ). CIP with Δ(rms)(2) ≈ 7 × 10(−)(3) improves the bestfit χ(2) by 3.6 compared to the adiabatic ΛCDM model. In contrast, although the temperature data favour A(L) simeq 1.22, allowing A(L) ≠ 1 does not improve the joint fit at all, since the lensing data disfavour A(L) ≠ 1. Indeed, CIP provides a rare example of a simple model, which is capable of reducing the Planck lensing anomaly significantly and fitting well simultaneously the high (and low) multipole temperature and lensing data, as well as the polarization data. Finally, we derive forecasts for two future satellite missions (LiteBIRD proposal to JAXA/NASA and Exploring Cosmic Origins with CORE proposal to ESA's M5 call) and compare these to simulated Planck data. Due to its coarse angular resolution, LiteBIRD is not able to improve the constraints on Δ(rms)(2) or A(L), but CORE-M5 (almost) reaches the cosmic variance limit and improves the CIP constraint to Δ(rms)(2) < 0.6 (1.4) × 10(−)(3) at 68 (95)% CL, which is nine times better than the current trispectrum based upper bound and six times better than obtained from the simulated Planck data. In addition, CORE-M5 will exquisitely distinguish between Δ(rms)(2) and A(L). No matter whether CIP is allowed for or not, the uncertainty of the lensing parameter will be σ(A(L)) ≈ 0.012, in the case where the simulated data are based on the adiabatic ΛCDM model with A(L) = 1.",1
112015,2,"Decay of a Thermofield-Double State in Chaotic Quantum Systems Scrambling in interacting quantum systems out of equilibrium is particularly effective in the chaotic regime. Under time evolution, initially localized information is said to be scrambled as it spreads throughout the entire system. This spreading can be analyzed with the spectral form factor, which is defined in terms of the analytic continuation of the partition function. The latter is equivalent to the survival probability of a thermofield double state under unitary dynamics. Using random matrices from the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) as Hamiltonians for the time evolution, we obtain exact analytical expressions at finite $N$ for the survival probability. Numerical simulations of the survival probability with matrices taken from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) are also provided. The GOE is more suitable for our comparison with numerical results obtained with a disordered spin chain with local interactions. Common features between the random matrix and the realistic disordered model in the chaotic regime are identified. The differences that emerge as the spin model approaches a many-body localized phase are also discussed.",1

Several spacetimes have already been implemented and tested. We demonstrate the validity of BHAC by means of various one-, two-, and three-dimensional test problems, as well as through a close comparison with the HARM3D code in the case of a torus accreting onto a black hole. The convergence of a turbulent accretion scenario is investigated with several diagnostics and we find accretion rates and horizon-penetrating fluxes to be convergent to within a few percent when the problem is run in three dimensions. Our analysis also involves the study of the corresponding thermal synchrotron emission, which is performed by means of a new general-relativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS.

We have built an adaptive bias voltage regulator (ADApower) that uses a linear algorithm to adjust the bias voltage V if the temperature T changes. We determined the V(T) dependence from measurements of the gain-versus-temperature dependence (dG/dT) for different bias voltage and the gain-versus-bias-voltage dependence (dG/dV) for different temperatures in a climate chamber SpiraB at CERN.

The CZT Imager of AstroSat on its very first day of operation detected a long duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), namely GRB 151006A. Using the off-axis imaging and spectral response of the instrument, we demonstrate that the CZT Imager can localize this GRB correctly to about a few degrees, and it can provide, in conjunction with Swift, spectral parameters similar to those obtained from Fermi/GBM. Hence, the CZT Imager would be a useful addition to the currently operating GRB instruments (Swift and Fermi). Specifically, we argue that the CZT Imager will be most useful for the short hard GRBs by providing localization for those detected by Fermi and spectral information for those detected only by Swift. We also provide preliminary results on a new exciting capability of this instrument: the CZT Imager is able to identify Compton scattered events thereby providing polarization information for bright GRBs. GRB 151006A, in spite of being relatively faint, shows hints of a polarization signal at 100–300 keV (though at a low significance level). We point out that the CZT Imager should provide significant time resolved polarization measurements for GRBs that have fluence three times higher than that of GRB 151006A. We estimate that the number of such bright GRBs detectable by the CZT Imager is five to six per year.

We present high-order-derivative boundary conditions for the gauge, constraint violating and gravitational wave degrees of freedom of the formulation. Second order derivative boundary conditions are presented in terms of the conformal variables used in numerical relativity simulations. Using Kreiss–Agranovich–Métivier theory we demonstrate, in the frozen coefficient approximation, that with sufficiently high order derivative boundary conditions the initial boundary value problem can be rendered boundary stable. The precise number of derivatives required depends on the gauge. For a choice of the gauge condition that renders the system strongly hyperbolic of constant multiplicity, well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem follows in this approximation.

112946,2,"The First Simultaneous X-Ray/Radio Detection of the First Be/BH System MWC 656 MWC 656 is the first known Be/black hole (BH) binary system. Be/BH binaries are important in the context of binary system evolution and sources of detectable gravitational waves because they are possible precursors of coalescing neutron star/BH binaries. X-ray observations conducted in 2013 revealed that MWC 656 is a quiescent high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB), opening the possibility to explore X-ray/radio correlations and the accretion/ejection coupling down to low luminosities for BH HMXBs. Here we report on a deep joint Chandra/VLA observation of MWC 656 (and contemporaneous optical data) conducted in 2015 July that has allowed us to unambiguously identify the X-ray counterpart of the source. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with a power law with Γ ∼ 2, providing a flux of ≃4 × 10(−)(15) erg cm(−)(2) s(−)(1) in the 0.5–8 keV energy range and a luminosity of L(X) ≃ 3 × 10(30) erg s(−)(1) at a 2.6 kpc distance. For a 5 M(⊙) BH this translates into ≃5 × 10(−)(9) L(Edd). These results imply that MWC 656 is about 7 times fainter in X-rays than it was two years before and reaches the faintest X-ray luminosities ever detected in stellar-mass BHs. The radio data provide a detection with a peak flux density of 3.5 ± 1.1 μJy beam(−)(1). The obtained X-ray/radio luminosities for this quiescent BH HMXB are fully compatible with those of the X-ray/radio correlations derived from quiescent BH low-mass X-ray binaries.

112981,2,"The Noncommutative Index Theorem and the Periodic Table for Disordered Topological Insulators and Superconductors We study a wide class of topological free-fermion systems on a hypercubic lattice in spatial dimensions d ≥ 1. When the Fermi level lies in a spectral gap or a mobility gap, the topological properties, e.g., the integral quantization of the topological invariant, are protected by certain symmetries of the Hamiltonian against disorder. This generic feature is characterized by a generalized index theorem which is a noncommutative analog of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. The noncommutative index defined in terms of a pair of projections gives a precise formula for the topological invariant in each symmetry class in any dimension (d ≥ 1). Under the assumption on the nonvanishing spectral or mobility gap, we prove that the index formula reproduces Bott periodicity and all of the possible values of topological invariants in the classification table of topological insulators and superconductors.

113248,2,"Relativistic Turbulence with Strong Synchrotron and Synchrotron-Self-Compton Cooling Many relativistic plasma environments in high-energy astrophysics, including pulsar wind nebulae, hot accretion flows onto black holes, relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts, and giant radio lobes, are naturally turbulent. The plasma in these environments is often so hot that synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) radiative cooling becomes important. In this paper we investigate the general thermodynamic and radiative properties (and hence the observational appearance) of an optically thin relativistically hot plasma stirred by driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and cooled by radiation. We find that if the system reaches a statistical equilibrium where turbulent heating is balanced by radiative cooling, the effective electron temperature tends to attain a universal value $\theta = kT_e/m_e c^2 \sim 1/\sqrt{\tau_T}$, where $\tau_T=n_e\sigma_T L \ll 1$ is the system's Thomson optical depth, essentially independent of the strength of turbulent driving or magnetic field. This is because both MHD turbulent dissipation and synchrotron cooling are proportional to the magnetic energy density. We also find that synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) cooling and perhaps a few higher-order IC components are automatically comparable to synchrotron in this regime. The overall broadband radiation spectrum then consists of several distinct components (synchrotron, SSC, etc.), well separated in photon energy (by a factor $\sim \tau_T^{-1}$) and roughly equal in power. The number of IC peaks is checked by Klein-Nishina effects and depends logarithmically on $\tau_T$ and the magnetic field. We also examine the limitations due to synchrotron self-absorption, explore applications to Crab PWN and blazar jets, and discuss links to radiative magnetic reconnection.",1

Conductive channels are produced inside the sensor bulk using a femtosecond laser. This electrode geometry allows full charge collection even for low quality diamond sensors.

In order to understand the channel growth parameters, with the goal of producing low resistivity channels, the conductive channels produced with a different laser setup are evaluated by Raman spectroscopy.",1
113351,2,"Stable multi-GeV electron accelerator driven by waveform-controlled PW laser pulses The achievable energy and the stability of accelerated electron beams have been the most critical issues in laser wakefield acceleration. As laser propagation, plasma wave formation and electron acceleration are highly nonlinear processes, the laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) is extremely sensitive to initial experimental conditions. We propose a simple and elegant waveform control method for the LWFA process to enhance the performance of a laser electron accelerator by applying a fully optical and programmable technique to control the chirp of PW laser pulses. We found sensitive dependence of energy and stability of electron beams on the spectral phase of laser pulses and obtained stable 2-GeV electron beams from a 1-cm gas cell of helium. The waveform control technique for LWFA would prompt practical applications of centimeter-scale GeV-electron accelerators to a compact radiation sources in the x-ray and γ-ray regions.",1
113399,2,"The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a four telescope array designed to characterize relic primordial gravitational waves from in ation and the optical depth to reionization through a measurement of the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) on the largest angular scales. The frequencies of the four CLASS telescopes, one at 38 GHz, two at 93 GHz, and one dichroic system at 145/217 GHz, are chosen to avoid spectral regions of high atmospheric emission and span the minimum of the polarized Galactic foregrounds: synchrotron emission at lower frequencies and dust emission at higher frequencies. Low-noise transition edge sensor detectors and a rapid front-end polarization modulator provide a unique combination of high sensitivity, stability, and control of systematics. The CLASS site, at 5200 m in the Chilean Atacama desert, allows for daily mapping of up to 70% of the sky and enables the characterization of CMB polarization at the largest angular scales. Using this combination of a broad frequency range, large sky coverage, control over systematics, and high sensitivity, CLASS will observe the reionization and recombination peaks of the CMB E- and B-mode power spectra. CLASS will make a cosmic variance limited measurement of the optical depth to reionization and will measure or place upper limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, down to a level of 0.01 (95% C.L.).© (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The peculiarities of these methods applied to the search for fractals in sets containing only fractals and background events are studied. Procedures allowing one to establish the presence of fractals, estimate their number in the initial set, separate fractals, and evaluate the portion of background events in the extracted set are suggested.

113618,2,"Testing and selecting cosmological models with ultra-compact radio quasars In this paper, we place constraints on four alternative cosmological models under the assumption of the spatial flatness of the Universe: CPL, EDE, GCG and MPC. A new compilation of 120 compact radio quasars observed by very-long-baseline interferometry, which represents a type of new cosmological standard rulers, are used to test these cosmological models. Our results show that the fits on CPL obtained from the quasar sample are well consistent with those obtained from BAO. For other cosmological models considered, quasars provide constraints in agreement with those derived with other standard probes at $1\sigma $ confidence level. Moreover, the results obtained from other statistical methods including figure of merit, Om(z) and statefinder diagnostics indicate that: (1) Radio quasar standard ruler could provide better statistical constraints than BAO for all cosmological models considered, which suggests its potential to act as a powerful complementary probe to BAO and galaxy clusters. (2) Turning to Om(z) diagnostics, CPL, GCG and EDE models cannot be distinguished from each other at the present epoch. (3) In the framework of statefinder diagnostics, MPC and EDE will deviate from the $\Lambda $ CDM model in the near future, while GCG model cannot be distinguished from the $\Lambda $ CDM model unless much higher precision observations are available.",1
113689,2,"Early universe cosmology and dark energy: from the Big Bang to the late expansion of the universe In this thesis we address two of the most outstanding problems in cosmology: the singularity
problem and the late acceleration of the universe. In the first part, we address the singularity
problem that appears in the context of bouncing cosmologies, and suggest a formalism based
on the AdS/CFT correspondence to track the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the
presence of a space-like singularity that appears in a specific realization of a deformed AdS
space-time. Our construction sets the formalism for the evolution of a scalar field and
the curvature perturbations on a regularized field theory living in the boundary of this
space-time and shows that their momentum dependence is preserved, while a finite particle
production occurs. In the second part, we show two works that give a contribution to the
huge effort to unravel the nature of dark energy. In those, we focus in testing a model of
dark energy where an interaction with dark matter is allowed. This dynamical model has
impacts on the evolution of the parameters that describe our universe and we test these using
the latest cosmological observations. We use data from the Cosmic Microwave Background,
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations(BAO) and type Ia supernovae, and find good agreement with
observations, putting constraints in the cosmological parameters. We address the recently
found deviation from ΛCDM in high-redshifts found in measurements of the BAO of the
Lyman-
α
forest from quasars. We show that Hubble parameter and angular distance at
high-z for the interacting model have a better concordance with the ones obtained by the
BOSS collaboration than the ΛCDM model, and that adding this data set improves the
global fit of the model, although with low statistical significance.",1

At early times, Fermi target-of-opportunity observations prompted by their optical discoveries provided enhanced LAT exposure that enabled the detections of γ-ray onsets beginning ∼2 days after their first optical peaks. Significant γ-ray emission was found extending to 39–55 days after their initial LAT detections, with systematically fainter and longer-duration emission compared to previous γ-ray-detected classical novae. These novae were distinguished by multiple bright optical peaks that encompassed the time spans of the observed γ-rays. The γ-ray light curves and spectra of the two novae are presented along with representative hadronic and leptonic models, and comparisons with other novae detected by the LAT are discussed.",1
113752,2,"Exploring the propagation of relativistic quantum wavepackets in the trajectory-based formulation In the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, Gaussian wavepacket solutions of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation provide useful physical insight. This is not the case for relativistic quantum mechanics, however, for which both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac wave equations result in strange and counterintuitive wavepacket behaviors, even for free-particle Gaussians. These behaviors include zitterbewegung and other interference effects. As a potential remedy, this paper explores a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics, in which the wavefunction plays no role [Phys. Rev. X, 4, 040002 (2014)]. Quantum states are represented as ensembles of trajectories, whose mutual interaction is the source of all quantum effects observed in nature---suggesting a ""many interacting worlds"" interpretation. It is shown that the relativistic generalization of the trajectory-based formulation results in well-behaved free-particle Gaussian wavepacket solutions. In particular, probability density is positive and well-localized everywhere, and its spatial integral is conserved over time---in any inertial frame. Finally, the ensemble-averaged wavepacket motion is along a straight line path through spacetime. In this manner, the pathologies of the wave-based relativistic quantum theory, as applied to wavepacket propagation, are avoided.",1
113760,2,"Partial Breaking of Three-Fold Symmetry via Percolation of a Domain Wall We show that suppression of vortex strings splits the order-disorder transition in the three-state Potts ferromagnet on a simple cubic lattice and opens up an intermediate phase characterized by partial breaking of the three-fold symmetry and long-range order. In contrast, suppression of vortices in the same model on a square lattice results in an intermediate phase with enhanced U(1) symmetry and quasi-long-range order. We show that the difference between the two phases originates from distinct patterns of domain wall proliferation. A domain wall, separating the two most populous spin states, percolates on its own in the former phase but remains at a percolation threshold in the latter.",1

At first the motivational aspect to participate in the event was considered. Then, taking into account the content of the activities we search for the main goals and difficulties perceived by the students. From those informations we analysed the role of the event as a scientific communication instrument. For this, we take the contemporary definition of Science Communication proposed by Burns, O’Connor and Stocklmayer. In their view, science communication must be understood as a processes aiming to approach the scientific literacy ideals. Based on our results it is possible to suggest that the event is leading the participants to advance in direction of a Public Awareness and Understanding of Science. These processes allow the development of a scientific culture which, at the same time, works as cause and consequence for the processes engendering the Scientific Literacy ideals. From this perspective, we point out that changes in the event design as well as their contribuitions to socio-educational and cultural issues can be better supported.",1
113891,2,"Second law of gravitational thermodynamics in the locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type-II universe In this work, under the assumption that the universe is locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-II and filled with anisotropic dark fluid (dark energy and dark radiation), we investigate whether the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) is still valid. We also consider another important condition for LRS Bianchi type-II spacetimes whereby the model expansion $\theta $ is proportional to the shear $\sigma $, which leads to $B=A^{n}$ (where n is a constant and A and B are the metric potentials). Based on this, we derive a general circumstance for the GSLT and find that its validity depends on the anisotropies of both the dark fluid and the metric potentials. We conclude that the GSLT still holds at all times even if these two anisotropic conditions are removed from the results.",1

A non-Fermi liquid behaviour emerges at two pairs of isolated points on the Fermi surface due to the coupling of a bosonic order parameter to fermionic excitations at those so-called “hot-spots”. We find that near the hot-spots, σ and F obey the scalings expected for such an anisotropic system, and the direction-dependent viscosity to entropy density ratio is not a universal number due to the anisotropy. Lastly, we also estimate the effect of the fermion–boson coupling at the hot-spots on superconducting instabilities.",1
113991,2,"Determination of many-electron basis functions for a Quantum Hall ground state using Schur polynomials A method for determining the ground state of a planar interacting many-electron system in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane is described. The ground state wave-function is expressed as a linear combination of a set of basis functions. Given only the flux and the number of electrons describing an incompressible state, we use the combinatorics of partitioning the flux among the electrons to derive the basis wave-functions as linear combinations of Schur polynomials. The procedure ensures that the basis wave-functions form representations of the angular momentum algebra. We exemplify the method by deriving the basis functions for the 52 quantum Hall state with a few particles. We find that one of the basis functions is precisely the Moore–Read Pfaffian wave function.",1
114062,2,"A proposal for antiparallel acceleration of positrons using CEBAF We present a scheme for positron beam acceleration in CEBAF antiparallel to the normal electron path, requiring no change in polarity of the magnet systems. This feature is essential to the principal benefit: enabling extremely simple configuration changes between conventional (clockwise) e− acceleration and counter clockwise e+ acceleration. Additionally, it appears possible to configure the accelerating cavity phases to support concurrent acceleration of the electron and positron beams. The last mode also may enable use of the higher peak current electron beam for system diagnostics. The inherent penalty of the concurrent mode in acceleration efficiency and increased energy spread may render this a commissioning-only diagnostic option, but the possibility appears worthy of consideration.",1
114104,2,"Investigation of Ion Backflow in Bulk Micromegas Detectors The operation of gas detectors is often limited by secondary effects, originating from avalanche-induced photons and ions. Ion backflow is one of the effects limiting the operation of a gas detector at high flux, by giving rise to space charge which disturbs the electric field locally. For the Micromegas detector, a large fraction of the secondary positive ions created in the avalanche can be stopped at the micro-mesh. The present work involves measurements of the ion backflow fraction (using an experimental setup comprising of two drift planes) in bulk Micromegas detectors as a function of detector design parameters. These measured characteristics have also been compared in detail to numerical simulations using the Garfield framework that combines packages such as neBEM, Magboltz and Heed. Further, the effect of using a second micro-mesh on ion backflow and other parameters has been studied numerically.",1

114233,2,"Post-Newtonian Quasicircular Initial Orbits for Numerical Relativity We use post-Newtonian (PN) approximations to determine the initial orbital and spin parameters of black hole binaries that lead to low-eccentricity inspirals when evolved with numerical relativity techniques. In particular, we seek initial configurations that lead to very small eccentricities at small separations, as is expected for astrophysical systems. We consider three cases: (i) quasicircular orbits with no radial velocity, (ii) quasicircular orbits with an initial radial velocity determined by radiation reaction, and (iii) parameters obtained from evolution of the PN equations of motion from much larger separations. We study eight cases of spinning, nonprecessing, unequal mass binaries. We then use several definitions of the eccentricity, based on orbital separations and waveform phase and amplitude, and find that using the complete 3PN Hamiltonian for quasicircular orbits to obtain the tangential orbital momentum, and using the highest-known-order radiation reaction expressions to obtain the radial momentum, leads to the lowest eccentricity. The accuracy of this method even exceeds that of inspiral data based on 3PN and 4PN evolutions.",1

It reveals that gravitational collapse of DM and DE with interaction leads to the formation of the black hole. When l + 2λ < −3 (phantoms), dust and phantoms could be ejected from the death of white hole. This emitted matter again undergoes to collapsing process and becomes the black hole. This study gives the generalization for isotropy of pressure in the fluid to anisotropy when there will be interaction between DM and DE.",1
114486,2,"Nonlinear Dirac equation in two-spinor form: Separation in static RW space-time The Dirac equation with nonlinear terms induced by torsion is studied in Robertson-Walker (RW) space-time. An extension of a separation method of the equation, based on the Newman-Penrose formalism and previously applied to the nonlinear case, is considered. Accordingly the angular dependence of the Dirac spinor solution is separated, under a special assumption, in the general time-dependent RW metric. In the case of static RW metric the time dependence of the Dirac spinor factors out and one is left with a pair of two coupled nonlinear radial equations. The radial equations are disentangled by a suitable substitution of the spinor solution. The problem amounts then to the solution of a single second-order highly nonlinear differential equation. Some elementary considerations are done on the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the equation.",1

We argue that the same conclusions hold for compressible non-relativistic turbulence as well as for relativistic turbulence.

114629,2,"Parametrizing modified gravity for cosmological surveys One of the challenges in testing gravity with cosmology is the vast freedom opened when extending General Relativity. For linear perturbations, one solution consists in using the effective field theory of dark energy. Even then, the theory space is described in terms of a handful of free functions of time. This needs to be reduced to a finite number of parameters to be practical for cosmological surveys. We explore in this article how well simple parametrizations, with a small number of parameters, can fit observables computed from complex theories. Imposing the stability of linear perturbations appreciably reduces the theory space we explore. We find that observables are not extremely sensitive to short time-scale variations and that simple, smooth parametrizations are usually sufficient to describe this theory space. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that using two parameters for each function (an amplitude and a power-law index) is preferred over complex models for 86% of our theory space.",1
114652,2,"Accurate mass and velocity functions of dark matter haloes N-body cosmological simulations are an essential tool to understand the observed distribution of galaxies. We use the MultiDark simulation suite, run with the Planck cosmological parameters, to revisit the mass and velocity functions. At redshift z = 0, the simulations cover four orders of magnitude in halo mass from ∼10^11M_⊙ with 8783 874 distinct haloes and 532 533 subhaloes. The total volume used is ∼515 Gpc^3, more than eight times larger than in previous studies. We measure and model the halo mass function, its covariance matrix w.r.t halo mass and the large-scale halo bias. With the formalism of the excursion-set mass function, we explicit the tight interconnection between the covariance matrix, bias and halo mass function. We obtain a very accurate (<2 per cent level) model of the distinct halo mass function. We also model the subhalo mass function and its relation to the distinct halo mass function. The set of models obtained provides a complete and precise framework for the description of haloes in the concordance Planck cosmology.

114674,2,"Integrable coupled Liénard-type systems with balanced loss and gain A Hamiltonian formulation of generic many-particle systems with space-dependent balanced loss and gain coefficients is presented. It is shown that the balancing of loss and gain necessarily occurs in a pair-wise fashion. Further, using a suitable choice of co-ordinates, the Hamiltonian can always be reformulated as a many-particle system in the background of a pseudo-Euclidean metric and subjected to an analogous inhomogeneous magnetic field with a functional form that is identical with space-dependent loss/gain co-efficient.The resulting equations of motion from the Hamiltonian are a system of coupled Li$\acute{e}$nard-type differential equations. Partially integrable systems are obtained for two distinct cases, namely, systems with (i) translational symmetry or (ii) rotational invariance in a pseudo-Euclidean space. A total number of $m+1$ integrals of motion are constructed for a system of $2m$ particles, which are in involution, implying that two-particle systems are completely integrable. A few exact solutions for both the cases are presented for specific choices of the potential and space-dependent gain/loss co-efficients, which include periodic stable solutions. Quantization of the system is discussed with the construction of the integrals of motion for specific choices of the potential and gain-loss coefficients.

Velten and T.R.P. Caram\^es, claims that the reference ""A transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase of the universe expansion from the simplest non-trivial polynomial function of T in the f(R,T) formalism"" by P.H.R.S. Moraes, G. Ribeiro and R.A.C. Correa [Astrophys. Space Sci. 361 (2016) 227] has ""problematic points"" concerning its mathematical approach and observable consequences. Velten and Caram\^es argue that the equation of the scale factor evolution in time in the $f(R,T)=R+\alpha T+\beta T^{2}$ cosmology was erroneously calculated. One crucial consequence of the supposed corrected version of such an equation, presented by the authors in [Phys. Rev. D 95 (2017) 123536], would be the absence of the transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase of the expansion of the universe, an outcome originally predicted by Moraes, Ribeiro and Correa. We show that the above claim is incorrect and that there are no inconsistencies with the results by Moraes, Ribeiro and Correa in the referred work. In particular, we show that Velten and Caram\^es have incorrectly performed their calculations, invalidating all their mathematical and physical criticism regarding the article by Moraes, Ribeiro and Correa. In addition, we quote that the solutions obtained by Velten and Caram\^es are unfeasible in view of their mathematical misunderstanding.",1

114781,2,"Noninteracting fermions at finite temperature in a $d$-dimensional trap: Universal correlations We study a system of N noninteracting spinless fermions trapped in a confining potential, in arbitrary dimensions d and arbitrary temperature T. The presence of the confining trap breaks the translational invariance and introduces an edge where the average density of fermions vanishes. Far from the edge, near the center of the trap (the so-called “bulk regime”), where the fermions do not feel the curvature of the trap, physical properties of the fermions have traditionally been understood using the local density (or Thomas-Fermi) approximation. However, these approximations drastically fail near the edge where the density vanishes and thermal and quantum fluctuations are thus enhanced. The main goal of this paper is to show that, even near the edge, novel universal properties emerge, independently of the details of the shape of the confining potential. We present a unified framework to investigate both the bulk and the edge properties of the fermions. We show that for large N, these fermions in a confining trap, in arbitrary dimensions and at finite temperature, form a determinantal point process. As a result, any n-point correlation function, including the average density profile, can be expressed as an n×n determinant whose entry is called the kernel, a central object for such processes. Near the edge, we derive the large-N scaling form of the kernels, parametrized by d and T. In d=1 and T=0, this reduces to the so-called Airy kernel, that appears in the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of random matrix theory. In d=1 and T>0 we show a remarkable connection between our kernel and the one appearing in the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation at finite time. Consequently, our result provides a finite-T generalization of the Tracy-Widom distribution, that describes the fluctuations of the position of the rightmost fermion at T=0, or those of the largest single-fermion momentum. In d>1 and T≥0, while the connection to GUE no longer holds, the process is still determinantal whose analysis provides a new class of kernels, generalizing the 1d Airy kernel at T=0 obtained in random matrix theory. Some of our finite-temperature results should be testable in present-day cold-atom experiments, most notably our detailed predictions for the temperature dependence of the fluctuations near the edge.",1

114832,2,"Neutron-antineutron oscillations beyond the quasifree limit Prompted by plans for a free neutron oscillation experiment at the European Spallation Source (ESS), we consider issues associated with the magnetic fields that must be present. To this end, we introduce a stochastic model of the residual magnetic field within the propagation region which draws on features of magnetic profiles measured during the last free oscillation experiment at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL). A perturbative analysis, which relates the antineutron probability to the power spectral density of the magnetic field sampled, suggests that deviations from the quasifree result will increase quadratically with the length l of the propagation region. However, with inclusion of averaging over representative spectra of neutron speeds, departures from the quasifree result are found to be approximately linear in l. As regards the large spikes in the magnetic field at, for example, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite compensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate that their effect scales as l/D3/2, where D is the diameter of the cylindrical magnetic shielding, and identify conditions under which they can be neglected. We also establish that any large magnetic field encountered after the propagation region is exited will not diminish the probability for antineutron detection. For the range of values of l of most interest to the ESS experiment, it should suffice to improve on the level of magnetic suppression achieved at the ILL by a factor of 2.",1

In the first step generation and transport of radiationinside the ATLAS detector and the experimental cavern were simulated. Proton-proton collisions of 14 TeV were simulated with the DPMJET-III event generatorand used as the primary radiation source. Particles arriving to a selectedboundary, such as those entering the lateral cavern walls were written ontofiles via the FLUKA user routine mgdraw.f. These files were then used as theparticle source for the second step of the calculations to assess radiationpenetration and streaming to the location of interest.

114855,2,"Parameter constraints from weak-lensing tomography of galaxy shapes and cosmic microwave background fluctuations Recently, it has been shown that cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and three-dimensional (3D) cosmic shear allows to considerably tighten cosmological parameter constraints. We investigate whether similar improvement can be achieved in a conventional tomographic setup. We present Fisher parameter forecasts for a Euclid-like galaxy survey in combination with different ongoing and forthcoming CMB experiments. In contrast to a fully 3D analysis, we find only marginal improvement. Assuming Planck-like CMB data, we show that including the full covariance of the combined CMB and cosmic shear data improves the dark energy figure of merit (FOM) by only 3 per cent. The marginalized error on the sum of neutrino masses is reduced at the same level. For a next generation CMB satellite mission such as Prism, the predicted improvement of the dark energy FOM amounts to approximately 25 per cent. Furthermore, we show that the small improvement is contrasted by an increased bias in the dark energy parameters when the intrinsic alignment of galaxies is not correctly accounted for in the full covariance matrix.",1

Now, accelerators' experimental evidence for Tsallis' distributions has been ascertained only at very high energies. Here, instead, we develop a different set of q-Gamow states for which the associated q-Breit–Wigner distribution could easily be found at intermediate energies, for which accelerators are available at many locations. In this context, it should be strongly emphasized Vignat and Plastino (2009) [2] that, empirically, one never exactly and unambiguously “detects” pure Gaussians, but rather q-Gaussians.

115018,2,"Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection The precise value of the mean neutron lifetime, $\tau_n$, plays an important role in nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. It is a key input for predicting the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and is used to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. There is a 3.9 standard deviation discrepancy between $\tau_n$ measured by counting the decay rate of free neutrons in a beam (887.7 $\pm$ 2.2 s) and by counting surviving ultracold neutrons stored for different storage times in a material trap (878.5$\pm$0.8 s). The experiment described here eliminates loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with material trap walls and neutrons in quasi-stable orbits rapidly exit the trap. As a result of this approach and the use of a new in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here (877.7 $\pm$ 0.7 (stat) +0.4/-0.2 (sys) s) is the first modern measurement of $\tau_n$ that does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.",1

115250,2,"Lattice Homotopy Constraints on Phases of Quantum Magnets The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem and its extensions forbid trivial phases from arising in certain quantum magnets. Constraining infrared behavior with the ultraviolet data encoded in the microscopic lattice of spins, these theorems tie the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking to the emergence of exotic phases like quantum spin liquids. In this work, we take a new topological perspective on these theorems, by arguing they originate from an obstruction to “trivializing” the lattice under smooth, symmetric deformations, which we call the “lattice homotopy problem.” We conjecture that all LSM-like theorems for quantum magnets (many previously unknown) can be understood from lattice homotopy, which automatically incorporates the full spatial symmetry group of the lattice, including all its point-group symmetries. One consequence is that any spin-symmetric magnet with a half-integer moment on a site with even-order rotational symmetry must be a spin liquid. To substantiate the claim, we prove the conjecture in two dimensions for some physically relevant settings.",1
115254,2,"Many-body quantum chaos: Analytic connection to random matrix theory A key goal of quantum chaos is to establish a relationship between widely observed universal spectral fluctuations of clean quantum systems and random matrix theory (RMT). Most prominent features of such RMT behavior with respect to a random spectrum, both encompassed in the spectral pair correlation function, are statistical suppression of small level spacings (correlation hole) and enhanced stiffness of the spectrum at large spectral ranges. For single-particle systems with fully chaotic classical counterparts, the problem has been partly solved by Berry [Proc. R. Soc. A 400, 229 (1985)PRLAAZ1364-502110.1098/rspa.1985.0078] within the so-called diagonal approximation of semiclassical periodic-orbit sums, while the derivation of the full RMT spectral form factor K(t) (Fourier transform of the spectral pair correlation function) from semiclassics has been completed by Müller et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 014103 (2004)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.93.014103]. In recent years, the questions of long-time dynamics at high energies, for which the full many-body energy spectrum becomes relevant, are coming to the forefront even for simple many-body quantum systems, such as locally interacting spin chains. Such systems display two universal types of behaviour which are termed the “many-body localized phase” and “ergodic phase.” In the ergodic phase, the spectral fluctuations are excellently described by RMT, even for very simple interactions and in the absence of any external source of disorder. Here we provide a clear theoretical explanation for these observations. We compute K(t) in the leading two orders in t and show its agreement with RMT for nonintegrable, time-reversal invariant many-body systems without classical counterparts, a generic example of which are Ising spin-1/2 models in a periodically kicking transverse field. In particular, we relate K(t) to partition functions of a class of twisted classical Ising models on a ring of size t; hence, the leading-order RMT behavior K(t)≃2t is a consequence of translation and reflection symmetry of the Ising partition function.",1

We consider electron-nucleus tensor-pseudotensor (T-PT) and nuclear Schiff moment (NSM) interactions as the predominant sources that induce EDM in a diamagnetic atomic system. Our results from the CCSD method to EDM (da) of Yb171 due to the T-PT and NSM interactions are found to be da=4.85(6)×10−20〈σ〉CT|e|cm and da=2.89(4)×10−17S/(|e|fm3), respectively, where CT is the T-PT coupling constant and S is the NSM. These values differ significantly from the earlier calculations. The reason for the same has been attributed to large correlation effects arising through non-RPA type of interactions among the electrons in this atom that are observed by analyzing the differences in the RPA and CCSD results.

We solve the reduced Gromov-Witten theory of the Calabi-Yau threefold $S \times E$ for all curve classes which are primitive in the K3 factor. In particular, we deduce the Igusa cusp form conjecture. The proof relies on new results in the Gromov-Witten theory of elliptic curves and K3 surfaces. We show the generating series of Gromov-Witten classes of an elliptic curve are cycle-valued quasimodular forms and satisfy a holomorphic anomaly equation. The quasimodularity generalizes a result by Okounkov and Pandharipande, and the holomorphic anomaly equation proves a conjecture of Milanov, Ruan and Shen. We further conjecture quasimodularity and holomorphic anomaly equations for the cycle-valued Gromov-Witten theory of every elliptic fibration with section. The conjecture generalizes the holomorphic anomaly equations for ellliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds predicted by Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri, and Vafa.

115325,2,"Fast optimization algorithms and the cosmological constant Denef and Douglas have observed that in certain landscape models the problem of finding small values of the cosmological constant is a large instance of a problem that is hard for the complexity class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial-time). The number of elementary operations (quantum gates) needed to solve this problem by brute force search exceeds the estimated computational capacity of the observable Universe. Here we describe a way out of this puzzling circumstance: despite being NP-hard, the problem of finding a small cosmological constant can be attacked by more sophisticated algorithms whose performance vastly exceeds brute force search. In fact, in some parameter regimes the average-case complexity is polynomial. We demonstrate this by explicitly finding a cosmological constant of order 10-120 in a randomly generated 109-dimensional Arkani-Hamed–Dimopoulos–Kachru landscape.",1
115329,2,"Einstein–cartan Gravity with Torsion Field Serving as an Origin for the Cosmological Constant or Dark Energy Density We analyse the Einstein–Cartan gravity in its standard form ${ \mathcal R }=R+{{ \mathcal K }}^{2}$, where ${ \mathcal R }\ \mathrm{and}\ R$ are the Ricci scalar curvatures in the Einstein–Cartan and Einstein gravity, respectively, and ${{ \mathcal K }}^{2}$ is the quadratic contribution of torsion in terms of the contorsion tensor ${ \mathcal K }$. We treat torsion as an external (or background) field and show that its contribution to the Einstein equations can be interpreted in terms of the torsion energy–momentum tensor, local conservation of which in a curved spacetime with an arbitrary metric or an arbitrary gravitational field demands a proportionality of the torsion energy–momentum tensor to a metric tensor, a covariant derivative of which vanishes owing to the metricity condition. This allows us to claim that torsion can serve as an origin for the vacuum energy density, given by the cosmological constant or dark energy density in the universe. This is a model-independent result that may explain the small value of the cosmological constant, which is a long-standing problem in cosmology. We show that the obtained result is valid also in the Poincaré gauge gravitational theory of Kibble, where the Einstein–Hilbert action can be represented in the same form: ${ \mathcal R }=R+{{ \mathcal K }}^{2}$.",1

Incorporating the influence of the plate into the gauge field, we obtain the correspondent photon propagator and electron self-energy, showing that the logarithmic renormalization of the Fermi velocity is inhibited by the presence of the plate.

In this more general case, the corresponding formulation of Noether theorem gives that the conservation law displays a sort of ano\-ma\-ly, the constant of motion being the sum of the canonical generator of the symmetry transformations plus the generator $G$ of the gauge transformation $q_i \rightarrow q_i$, $p_i \rightarrow p_i - \partial G/ \partial q_i$.",1

115559,2,"Ultrarelativistic bound states in the spherical well We address an eigenvalue problem for the ultrarelativistic (Cauchy) operator (−Δ)1/2, whose action is restricted to functions that vanish beyond the interior of a unit sphere in three spatial dimensions. We provide high accuracy spectral data for lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this infinite spherical well problem. Our focus is on radial and orbital shapes of eigenfunctions. The spectrum consists of an ordered set of strictly positive eigenvalues which naturally splits into non-overlapping, orbitally labelled E(k,l) series. For each orbital label l = 0, 1, 2, …, the label k = 1, 2, … enumerates consecutive lth series eigenvalues. Each of them is 2l + 1-degenerate. The l = 0 eigenvalues series E(k,0) are identical with the set of even labeled eigenvalues for the d = 1 Cauchy well: E(k,0)(d = 3) = E2k(d = 1). Likewise, the eigenfunctions ψ(k,0)(d = 3) and ψ2k(d = 1) show affinity. We have identified the generic functional form of eigenfunctions of the spherical well which appear to be composed of a product of a solid harmonic and of a suitable purely radial function. The method to evaluate (approximately) the latter has been found to follow the universal pattern which effectively allows to skip all, sometimes involved, intermediate calculations (those were in usage, while computing the eigenvalues for l ≤ 3).",1
115575,2,"Energy Observable for a Quantum System with a Dynamical Hilbert Space and a Global Geometric Extension of Quantum Theory A non-Hermitian operator may serve as the Hamiltonian for a unitary quantum system, if we can modify the Hilbert space of state vectors of the system so that it turns into a Hermitian operator. If this operator is time-dependent, the modified Hilbert space is generally time-dependent. This in turn leads to a generic conflict between the condition that the Hamiltonian is an observable of the system and that it generates a unitary time-evolution via the standard Schr\""odinger equation. We propose a geometric framework for addressing this problem. In particular we show that the Hamiltonian operator consists of a geometric part, which is determined by a metric-compatible connection on an underlying Hermitian vector bundle, and a non-geometric part which we identify with the energy observable. The same quantum system can be locally described using a time-dependent Hamiltonian that acts in a time-independent state space and is the sum of a geometric part and the energy operator. The full global description of the system is achieved within the framework of a moderate geometric extension of quantum mechanics where the role of the Hilbert space of state vectors is played by a Hermitian vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ endowed with a metric compatible connection, and observables are given by global sections of a real vector bundle that is determined by $\mathcal{E}$. We examine the utility of our proposal to describe a class of two-level systems where $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle over a two-dimensional sphere.",1

The forward shock is sub-dominant in the radio band, instead, the radio emission is dominated by two additional components. The first component is consistent with emission from a reverse shock, indicating an initial Lorentz factor of ${{\rm{\Gamma }}}_{0}\gtrsim 100$ and an ejecta magnetization of ${R}_{B}\approx 1\mbox{--}100$. The second component exhibits peculiar spectral and temporal evolution and is most likely the result of scattering of the radio emission by the turbulent Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). Such scattering is expected in any sufficiently compact extragalactic source and has been seen in GRBs before, but the large amplitude and long duration of the variability seen here are qualitatively more similar to extreme scattering events previously observed in quasars, rather than normal interstellar scintillation effects.

116167,2,"Preparing for advanced LIGO: A Star-Galaxy Separation Catalog for the Palomar Transient Factory The search for fast optical transients, such as the expected electromagnetic counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, is riddled with false positives (FPs) ranging from asteroids to stellar flares. While moving objects are readily rejected via image pairs separated by ~1 hr, stellar flares represent a challenging foreground, significantly outnumbering rapidly evolving explosions. Identifying stellar sources close to and fainter than the transient detection limit can eliminate these FPs. Here, we present a method to reliably identify stars in deep co-adds of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) imaging. Our machine-learning methodology utilizes the random forest (RF) algorithm, which is trained using sources with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. When evaluated on an independent test set, the PTF RF model outperforms the SExtractor star classifier by ~4%. For faint sources ( mag), which dominate the field population, the PTF RF model produces a ~19% improvement over SExtractor. To avoid false negatives in the PTF transient-candidate stream, we adopt a conservative stellar classification threshold, corresponding to a galaxy misclassification rate of 0.005. Ultimately, ~ objects are included in our PTF point-source catalog, of which only ~106 are expected to be galaxies. We demonstrate that the PTF RF catalog reveals transients that otherwise would have been missed. To leverage its superior image quality, we additionally create an SDSS point-source catalog, which is also tuned to have a galaxy misclassification rate of 0.005. These catalogs have been incorporated into the PTF real-time pipelines to automatically reject stellar sources as non-extragalactic transients.",1

The theorem is stronger than Lovelock's in two ways: it holds in all dimensions, and so supports a generalized argument for uniqueness; it does not assume that the desired tensor depends on the metric only up second-order partial-derivatives, that condition being a consequence of the proof. This has consequences for understanding the nature of the cosmological constant and theories of higher-dimensional gravity. Another consequence of the theorem is that it makes precise the sense in which there can be no gravitational stress-energy tensor in general relativity. Along the way, I prove a result of some interest about the second jet-bundle of the bundle of metrics over a manifold.",1
116589,2,"Interference in spectrum of radiation from doubly scattered charged particle Existence of different types of interference in the spectrum of radiation emitted by a doubly hard scattered electron is demonstrated. The spectrum develops oscillations in two regions: the hard, where they depend on the electron Lorentz factor, and the soft, where the oscillations depend on the electron scattering angles. This interference pattern owes to the presence of jetlike radiation configurations, formed by a piecewise-rectilinearly moving electron and the accompanying photon. The corresponding nondipole decomposition relation is derived. Notions describing proper field formation and interference, and presumably being applicable more generally, are discussed in detail.",1
116602,2,"Achievement of a low-loss 1-MW beam operation in the 3-GeV rapid cycling synchrotron of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex The 3-GeV rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS) of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) is now in the final beam commissioning phase, aiming for a design output beam power of 1 MW. With a series of injector linac upgrades in 2013 and 2014, RCS developed a high-intensity beam test, and launched 1-MW beam tuning in October 2014. The most important issues in realizing such a high-power continuous beam operation are to control and minimize beam loss for maintaining machine activations within permissible levels. In RCS, numerical simulation was successfully utilized along with experimental approaches to isolate the mechanism of beam loss and find its solution. By iteratively performing actual beam experiments and numerical simulations, and also by several hardware improvements, we have recently established a 1-MW beam operation with very low fractional beam loss of a couple of 10-3. In this paper, our recent efforts toward realizing such a low-loss high-intensity beam acceleration are presented as a follow-up of our previous article, H. Hotchi et al. Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 12, 040402 (2009)PRABFM1098-440210.1103/PhysRevSTAB.12.040402, in which the initial beam commissioning status of RCS has been reported.",1

116712,2,"Several solutions of the Klein–Gordon equation in Kerr–Newman spacetime and the BSW effect We investigate the radial part of the charged massive Klein–Gordon equation in Kerr–Newman spacetime, and in several specific situations, obtain exact solutions by means of essentially hypergeometric functions or their confluent types. Using these global solutions and generally obtained local solutions, we calculate a sort of intensity of the collision of two field excitations, which is a slight generalization of the trace of the stress tensor. We find that when the black hole is nonextremal, the intensity of the collision of two ingoing modes is bounded. However, in the extremal limit, more precisely $$\hbar \kappa_{\rm H} \rightarrow 0$$, the upper bound grows so that when the frequency of one of the two modes satisfies the critical relation, the intensity of the collision at the horizon becomes unboundedly large. Furthermore, the intensity of the collision of ingoing and outgoing modes is always unbounded, as well as in the classical particle theory. Our results suggest that the BSW effect is inherited by the quantum theory.",1

In this paper, an alternative fully-automatic solution, equally based on PID controllers, is proposed. Following the comparison of the operational expertise and alternative fully-automatic approaches, a new process control configuration, based on an estimated multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) model is proposed. The new MIMO model-based approach fulfils the required operational constraints while improving performance compared to existing solutions. The analysis and design work is carried out using both theoretical and numerical tools and is validated on the case study of the High Field Magnet (HFM) cryogenic test bench running at the SM18 test facility located at CERN.

116747,2,"On the implementation of the spherical collapse model for dark energy models In this work we review the theory of the spherical collapse model and critically analyse the aspects of the numerical implementation of its fundamental equations. By extending a recent work by [1], we show how different aspects, such as the initial integration time, the definition of constant infinity and the criterion for the extrapolation method (how close the inverse of the overdensity has to be to zero at the collapse time) can lead to an erroneous estimation (a few per mill error which translates to a few percent in the mass function) of the key quantity in the spherical collapse model: the linear critical overdensity δ(c), which plays a crucial role for the mass function of halos. We provide a better recipe to adopt in designing a code suitable to a generic smooth dark energy model and we compare our numerical results with analytic predictions for the EdS and the ΛCDM models. We further discuss the evolution of δ(c) for selected classes of dark energy models as a general test of the robustness of our implementation.

116794,2,"Disentangling hadronic from leptonic emission in the composite SNR G326.3$-$1.8 G326.3$-$1.8 (also known as MSH 15$-$56) has been detected in radio as a middle-aged composite supernova remnant (SNR) consisting of an SNR shell and a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which has been crushed by the SNR's reverse shock. Previous $\gamma$-ray studies of SNR G326.3$-$1.8 revealed bright and extended emission with uncertain origin. Understanding the nature of the $\gamma$-ray emission allows probing the population of high-energy particles (leptons or hadrons) but can be challenging for sources of small angular extent. With the recent $\textit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope data release Pass 8, we investigate the morphology of this SNR to disentangle the PWN from the SNR contribution. We perform a morphological and spectral analysis from 300 MeV to 300 GeV. We use the reconstructed events with the best angular resolution to separately investigate the PWN and the SNR emissions, which is crucial to accurately determine the spectral properties of G326.3$-$1.8 and understand its nature. The centroid of the $\gamma$-ray emission evolves with energy and is spatially coincident with the radio PWN at high energies (E $>$ 3 GeV). The morphological analysis reveals that a model considering two contributions from the SNR and the PWN reproduces the $\gamma$-ray data better than a single-component model. The associated spectral analysis using power laws shows two distinct spectral features, a softer spectrum for the remnant ($\Gamma$ = 2.17 $\pm$ 0.06) and a harder spectrum for the PWN ($\Gamma$ = 1.79 $\pm$ 0.12), consistent with hadronic and leptonic origin for the SNR and the PWN respectively. Focusing on the SNR spectrum, we use one-zone models to derive some physical properties and, in particular, we find that the emission is best explained with a hadronic scenario in which the large target density is provided by radiative shocks in HI clouds struck by the SNR.",1

116819,2,"On the Conservation of Information in Quantum Physics According to quantum mechanics, the informational content of isolated systems does not change in time. However, subadditivity of entropy seems to describe an excess of information when we look at single parts of a composite systems and their correlations. Moreover, the balance between the entropic contributions coming from the various parts is not conserved under unitary transformations. Reasoning on the basic concept of quantum mechanics, we find that in such a picture an important term has been overlooked: the intrinsic quantum information encoded in the coherence of pure states. To fill this gap we are led to define a quantity, that we call coherent entropy, which is necessary to account for the ""missing"" information and for re-establishing its conservation. Interestingly, the coherent entropy is found to be equal to the information conveyed in the future by quantum states. The perspective outlined in this paper may be of some inspiration in several fields, from foundations of quantum mechanics to black-hole physics.",1

The performance is found to be described primarily by a simple scaling parameter. The dependence of the bunching amplitude on fluctuations of critical parameters is derived analytically, and compared with simulations. Where applicable, EEHG is also compared with high gain harmonic generation (HGHG) and we find that EEHG is generally less sensitive to several types of energy structure. In the presence of intermediate frequency modulations like those produced by the microbunching instability, EEHG has a substantially narrower intrinsic bunching pedestal.",1
116944,2,"GRBs and fundamental physics Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short and intense flashes at the cosmological distances, which are the most luminous explosions in the Universe. The high luminosities of GRBs make them detectable out to the edge of the visible universe. So, they are unique tools to probe the properties of high-redshift universe: including the cosmic expansion and dark energy, star formation rate, the reionization epoch and the metal evolution of the Universe. First, they can be used to constrain the history of cosmic acceleration and the evolution of dark energy in a redshift range hardly achievable by other cosmological probes. Second, long GRBs are believed to be formed by collapse of massive stars. So they can be used to derive the high-redshift star formation rate, which can not be probed by current observations. Moreover, the use of GRBs as cosmological tools could unveil the reionization history and metal evolution of the Universe, the intergalactic medium (IGM) properties and the nature of first stars in the early universe. But beyond that, the GRB high-energy photons can be applied to constrain Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) and to test Einstein’s Equivalence Principle (EEP).

Intermediate energies, below the threshold for pion production, deserve special attention: it is the region where comparison with exact theoretical calculations is possible, while the sen- sitivity to various aspects of the interaction, like subtle effects of dynamics beyond the pairwise nucleon-nucleon force (so-called three-nucleon force), Coulomb interaction between protons, or relativistic effects, is significant.

117198,2,"Renyi Entropy of Chaotic Eigenstates Using arguments built on ergodicity, we derive an analytical expression for the Renyi entanglement entropies corresponding to the finite-energy density eigenstates of chaotic many-body Hamiltonians. The expression is a universal function of the density of states and is valid even when the subsystem is a finite fraction of the total system - a regime in which the reduced density matrix is not thermal. We find that in the thermodynamic limit, only the von Neumann entropy density is independent of the subsystem to the total system ratio $V_A/V$, while the Renyi entropy densities depend non-linearly on $V_A/V$. Surprisingly, Renyi entropies $S_n$ for $n > 1$ are convex functions of the subsystem size, with a volume law coefficient that depends on $V_A/V$, and exceeds that of a thermal mixed state at the same energy density. We provide two different arguments to support our results: the first one relies on a many-body version of Berry's formula for chaotic quantum mechanical systems, and is closely related to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The second argument relies on the assumption that for a fixed energy in a subsystem, all states in its complement allowed by the energy conservation are equally likely. We perform Exact Diagonalization study on quantum spin-chain Hamiltonians to test our analytical predictions, and find good agreement.",1

The no-hair theorem can be tested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric which alter such higher-order moments. In this review, I discuss tests of the no-hair theorem with current and future observations of such black holes across the electromagnetic spectrum, focusing on near-infrared observations of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center, pulsar-timing and very-long baseline interferometric observations, as well as x-ray observations of fluorescent iron lines, thermal continuum spectra, variability, and polarization.",1

The monoidal structure implies the existence of a cup product on noncommutative sheaf cohomology.

117243,2,"Elementary example of energy and momentum of an extended physical system in special relativity An instructive paradox concerning classical description of energy and momentum of extended physical systems in special relativity theory is explained using an elementary example of two point-like massive bodies rotating on a circle in their center-of-mass frame of reference, connected by an arbitrarily light and infinitesimally thin string. Namely, from the point of view of the inertial observers who move with respect to the rotating system, the sums of energies and momenta of the two bodies oscillate, instead of being constant in time. This result is understood in terms of the mechanism that binds the bodies: the string contributes to the system total energy and momentum no matter how light it is. Its contribution eliminates the unphysical oscillations from the system total four-momentum. Generality of the relativistic approach, applied here to the rotor example, suggests that in every extended physical system its binding mechanism contributes to its total energy and momentum.",1

117288,2,"Gauging Spatial Symmetries and the Classification of Topological Crystalline Phases We put the theory of interacting topological crystalline phases on a systematic footing. These are topological phases protected by space-group symmetries. Our central tool is an elucidation of what it means to “gauge” such symmetries. We introduce the notion of a crystalline topological liquid and argue that most (and perhaps all) phases of interest are likely to satisfy this criterion. We prove a crystalline equivalence principle, which states that in Euclidean space, crystalline topological liquids with symmetry group G are in one-to-one correspondence with topological phases protected by the same symmetry G, but acting internally, where if an element of G is orientation reversing, it is realized as an antiunitary symmetry in the internal symmetry group. As an example, we explicitly compute, using group cohomology, a partial classification of bosonic symmetry-protected topological phases protected by crystalline symmetries in (3+1) dimensions for 227 of the 230 space groups. For the 65 space groups not containing orientation-reversing elements (Sohncke groups), there are no cobordism invariants that may contribute phases beyond group cohomology, so we conjecture that our classification is complete.",1

117681,2,"Emergence and spontaneous breaking of approximate $O(4)$ symmetry at a weakly first-order deconfined phase transition We investigate approximate emergent nonabelian symmetry in a class of weakly first order `deconfined' phase transitions using Monte Carlo simulations. We study a transition in a 3D classical loop model that is analogous to a deconfined 2+1D quantum phase transition in a magnet with reduced lattice symmetry. This transition is between the N\'eel phase and a twofold degenerate valence bond solid (lattice-symmetry-breaking) phase. The combined order parameter at the transition is effectively a four-component superspin. It has been argued that in some weakly first order `pseudocritical' deconfined phase transitions, the renormalization group flow can take the system very close to the ordered fixed point of the symmetric $O(N)$ sigma model, where $N$ is the total number of `soft' order parameter components, despite the fact that $O(N)$ is not a microscopic symmetry. This yields a first order transition with unconventional phenomenology. We argue that this occurs in the present model, with $N=4$. This means that there is a regime of lengthscales in which the transition resembles a `spin-flop' transition in the ordered $O(4)$ sigma model. We give numerical evidence for (i) the first order nature of the transition, (ii) the emergence of $O(4)$ symmetry to an accurate approximation, and (iii) the existence of a regime in which the emergent $O(4)$ is `spontaneously broken', with distinctive features in the order parameter probability distribution. These results may be relevant for other models studied in the literature, including 2+1D QED with two flavours, the `easy-plane' deconfined critical point, and the N\'eel--VBS transition on the rectangular lattice.",1

This bias is an important potential systematic of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method measurements of the cosmic distance scale using the two-point clustering.

The models are constructed for two different ways of modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action. Exact solutions of the field equations are obtained by a novel method of integration. We have explored the behaviour of the cosmic transit from an decelerated phase of expansion to an accelerated phase to get the dynamical features of the universe.

118006,2,"Speeding up $N$-body simulations of modified gravity: Chameleon screening models We describe and demonstrate the potential of a new and very efficient method for simulating certain classes of modified gravity theories, such as the widely studied f(R) gravity models. High resolution simulations for such models are currently very slow due to the highly nonlinear partial differential equation that needs to be solved exactly to predict the modified gravitational force. This nonlinearity is partly inherent, but is also exacerbated by the specific numerical algorithm used, which employs a variable redefinition to prevent numerical instabilities. The standard Newton-Gauss-Seidel iterative method used to tackle this problem has a poor convergence rate. Our new method not only avoids this, but also allows the discretised equation to be written in a form that is analytically solvable. We show that this new method greatly improves the performance and efficiency of f(R) simulations. For example, a test simulation with 512(3) particles in a box of size 512 Mpc/h is now 5 times faster than before, while a Millennium-resolution simulation for f(R) gravity is estimated to be more than 20 times faster than with the old method. Our new implementation will be particularly useful for running very high resolution, large-sized simulations which, to date, are only possible for the standard model, and also makes it feasible to run large numbers of lower resolution simulations for covariance analyses. We hope that the method will bring us to a new era for precision cosmological tests of gravity.",1

The VEPP-4M collider has appropriate equipment for the method implementation: built-in focusing magnetic spectrometer, Compton calibration system with two lasers and a photon coordinate detector. Thus, the proposed technique could be implemented with minimum efforts, tests and further upgrade are planned. The beam energy can be defined with expected uncertainty better than 10(−)(4).",1
118256,2,"Inequivalence between gravitational mass and energy due to quantum effects at microscopic and macroscopic levels In this paper, we review recent theoretical results, demonstrating breakdown of the equivalence between active and passive gravitational masses and energy due to quantum effects in general relativity. In particular, we discuss the simplest composite quantum body — a hydrogen atom — and define its gravitational masses operators. Using Gedanken experiment, we show that the famous Einstein’s equation, E = mc2, is broken with small probability for passive gravitational mass of the atom. It is important that the expectation values of both active and passive gravitational masses satisfy the above-mentioned equation for stationary quantum states. Nevertheless, we stress that, for quantum superpositions of stationary states in a hydrogen atom, where the expectation values of energy are constant, the expectation values of the masses oscillate in time and, thus, break the Einstein’s equation. We briefly discuss experimental possibility to observe the above-mentioned time-dependent oscillations. In this review, we also improve several drawbacks of the original pioneering works.",1
118320,2,"Dynamic Equations for a Free Particle Motion in a Discrete Space-Time Geometry One considers the discrete space-time geometry $\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm {d}}$ , which is given on the set of points (events), where the geometry of Minkowski is given. This discrete geometry is not a geometry on lattice. Motion of a free particle is considered in $\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm {d}}$ . Free motion in $\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm {d}}$ can be reduced to a motion in geometry of Minkowski $\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm {M}}$ in some force field. Primordial free motion in $\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm {d}}$ appears to be stochastic. In $\mathcal {G }_{\mathrm {M}}$ it is difficult to describe the force field responsible for stochastic motion of a particle. The nature of this force field appears to be geometrical.",1
118366,2,First Experiences with HESR Stochastic Cooling System The stochastic cooling system of the HESR (High Energy Storage Ring) is based on completely new structures especially designed for the HESR. Each beam surrounding slot of these so called slot-ring couplers covers the whole image current without a reduction of the HESR aperture and without any plunging system. One pickup and one kicker have been already fabricated and installed into the COSY ring to demonstrate stochastic cooling in all three dimensions with only one structure. First results of commissioning with proton beams will be presented. The longitudinal cooling system at HESR is based on filter cooling with an optical notch-filter and ToF cooling. The demanding accuracy concerning phase stability requires dedicated control of the notch-frequency. The optical COSY filter has been modified and can be proven in long term runs together with the new stochastic cooling system.,1
118380,2,"Some applications and constructions of intertwining operators in LCFT We discuss some applications of fusion rules and intertwining operators in the representation theory of cyclic orbifolds of the triplet vertex operator algebra. We prove that the classification of irreducible modules for the orbifold vertex algebra W(p)^{A_m} follows from a conjectural fusion rules formula for the singlet vertex algebra modules. In the p=2 case, we computed fusion rules for the irreducible singlet vertex algebra modules by using intertwining operators. This result implies the classification of irreducible modules for W(2)^{A_m}, conjectured previously in [4]. The main technical tool is a new deformed realization of the triplet and singlet vertex algebras, which is used to construct certain intertwining operators that can not be detected by using standard free field realizations.",1

118388,2,"Bianchi type-VIII spinor solutions Within the scope of Bianchi type-VIII space-time the role of nonlinear spinor field in the evolution of the Universe is studied. It is found that, unlike the diagonal Bianchi models, in this case the components of energy-momentum tensor of spinor field along the principal axis are not the same, i.e. $T_{1}^{1} \ne T_{2}^{2} \ne T_{3}^{3}$ , even in the absence of spinor field nonlinearity. The presence of nontrivial non-diagonal components of energy-momentum tensor of the spinor field imposes severe restrictions both on geometry of space-time and on the spinor field itself. While the energy-momentum with diagonal components alone allows only locally rotational symmetry, say $a_{1} \sim a_{2}$ , in this case there might be a second case with $a_{1} \sim a_{2} \sim a_{3}$ . It was found that, like a Bianchi type-IX case, a positive $\lambda_{1}$ gives rise to an oscillatory mode of expansion, while a trivial $\lambda_{1}$ leads to rapid expansion at the early stage of evolution.",1

When the laser pulses are linearly polarized, the temporal distribution of the pairs is found to be sensitive with CEP. Same analysis is also done for the counterpropagating circularly e-polarized laser pulses. It is seen that when the counterpropagating laser pulses are both right (left) circularly polarized, the effect of the CEP is insignificant. On the other hand when the superimposed fields are in the combination of right and left circular polarizations, the CEP dependence comes in the invariant electric and magnetic fields structure and hence it reflects in the particle–antiparticle temporal distribution. However, the average number of total pairs is not greatly influenced by CEP for both the polarizations.",1
118594,2,"Distribution of periodic trajectories of C-K systems MIXMAX pseudorandom number generator We are considering the hyperbolic C-K systems of Anosov–Kolmogorov which are defined on high dimensional tori and are used to generate pseudorandom numbers for Monte-Carlo simulations. All trajectories of the C-K systems are exponentially unstable and pseudorandom numbers are represented in terms of coordinates of very long chaotic trajectories. The C-K systems on a torus have countable set of everywhere dense periodic trajectories and their distribution play a crucial role in coding and implementation of the pseudorandom number generator. The asymptotic distribution of chaotic trajectories of C-K systems with periods less than a given number is well known in mathematical literature, but a deviation from its asymptotic behavior is unknown. Using analytical and computer calculations, we are studying a distribution function of periodic trajectories and their deviation from asymptotic behavior. The corresponding MIXMAX generator has the best combination of speed, size of the state and is currently available generator.",1
118610,2,"Universal subhalo accretion in cold and warm dark matter cosmologies The influence of the large-scale structure on host haloes may be studied by examining the angular infall pattern of subhaloes. In particular, since warm dark matter (WDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies predict different abundances and internal properties for haloes at the low-mass end of the mass function, it is interesting to examine if there are differences in how these low-mass haloes are accreted. The accretion events are defined as the moment a halo becomes a substructure, namely when it crosses its host’s virial radius. We quantify the cosmic web at each point by the shear tensor and examine where, with respect to its eigenvectors, such accretion events occur in ΛCDM and ΛWDM (1 keV sterile neutrino) cosmological models. We find that the CDM and WDM subhaloes are preferentially accreted along the principal axis of the shear tensor corresponding to the direction of weakest collapse. The beaming strength is modulated by the host and subhalo masses and by the redshift at which the accretion event occurs. Although strongest for the most massive hosts and subhaloes at high redshift, the preferential infall is found to be always aligned with the axis of weakest collapse, thus we say that it has universal nature. We compare the strength of beaming in the ΛWDM cosmology with the one found in the ΛCDM scenario. While the main findings remain the same, the accretion in the ΛWDM model for the most massive host haloes appears more beamed than in ΛCDM cosmology across all the redshifts.",1
118623,2,"Galaxy bispectrum, primordial non-Gaussianity and redshift space distortions Measurements of the non-Gaussianity of the primordial density field have the power to considerably improve our understanding of the physics of inflation. Indeed, if we can increase the precision of current measurements by an order of magnitude, a null-detection would rule out many classes of scenarios for generating primordial fluctuations. Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys represent experiments that hold the promise to realise this goal. Thus, we model the galaxy bispectrum and forecast the accuracy with which it will probe the parameter f(NL), which represents the degree of primordial local-type non Gaussianity. Specifically, we address the problem of modelling redshift space distortions (RSD) in the tree-level galaxy bispectrum including f(NL). We find novel contributions associated with RSD, with the characteristic large scale amplification induced by local-type non-Gaussianity. These RSD effects must be properly accounted for in order to obtain un-biased measurements of f(NL) from the galaxy bispectrum. We propose an analytic template for the monopole which can be used to fit against data on large scales, extending models used in the recent measurements. Finally, we perform idealised forecasts on σf(NL)—the accuracy of the determination of local non-linear parameter f(NL)—from measurements of the galaxy bispectrum. Our findings suggest that current surveys can in principle provide f(NL) constraints competitive with Planck, and future surveys could improve them further.",1

118673,2,"Aerosol Measurements with the FRAM Telescope Precision stellar photometry using a telescope equipped with a CCD camera is an obvious way to measure the total aerosol content of the atmosphere as the apparent brightness of every star is affected by scattering. Achieving high precision in the vertical aerosol optical depth (at the level of 0.01) presents a series of interesting challenges. Using 3.5 years of data taken by the FRAM instrument at the Pierre Auger Observatory, we have developed a set of methods and tools to overcome most of these challenges. We use a wide-field camera and measure stars over a large span in airmass to eliminate the need for absolute calibration of the instrument. The main issues for data processing include camera calibration, source identification in curved field, catalog deficiencies, automated aperture photometry in rich fields with lens distortion and corrections for star color. In the next step, we model the airmass-dependence of the extinction and subtract the Rayleigh component of scattering, using laboratory measurements of spectral sensitivity of the device. In this contribution, we focus on the caveats and solutions found during the development of the methods, as well as several issues yet to be solved. Finally, future outlooks, such as the possibility for precision measurements of wavelength dependence of the extinction are discussed.",1

118795,2,"Geometric and growth rate tests of General Relativity with recovered linear cosmological perturbations I investigate the consistency of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey v7 galaxy sample with the expansion history and linear growth rate predicted by General Relativity (GR) and a Planck (2015) cosmology. To do so, I measure the redshift-space power spectrum, which is anisotropic due to both redshift-space distortions (RSD) and the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect. In Chapter 6, I place constraints of $f \sigma_8(0.76) = 0.44 \pm 0.04$ and $f \sigma_8(1.05) = 0.28 \pm 0.08$, which remain consistent with GR at 95% confidence. Marginalising over the anisotropic AP effect degrades the constraints by a factor of three but allows $F_{AP} \equiv (1+z) D_A H/c$ to be simultaneously constrained. The VIPERS v7 joint-posterior on $(f \sigma_8, F_{AP})$ shows no compelling deviation from GR. Chapter 7 investigates the inclusion of a simple density transform: `clipping' prior to the RSD analysis. This tackles the root-cause of non-linearity and may extend the validity of perturbation theory. Moreover, this marked statistic would amplify signatures of shielded modified gravity models and includes information not available to the power spectrum. I show that a linear real-space power spectrum with a Kaiser factor and a Lorentzian damping yields a significant bias without clipping, but that this may be removed with a strict threshold; similar behaviour is observed for the data. Estimates of $f \sigma_8$ for different thresholds are highly correlated, but this may be obtained using mocks. A maximum likelihood estimate from a combination of thresholds is shown to achieve a 16% decrease in statistical error relative to a single-threshold estimate. The results are encouraging to date but represent a work in progress; the final analysis will be submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics as Wilson et al. (2016).",1

Special emphasis is put on the properties of the transition amplitude. In fact, its original expression as resulting from applying the Wick's theorem turns out to be divergent and not to manifestly fulfill gauge invariance. By restoring the latter, the amplitude is regularized and investigated in different regimes. In particular, the amplitude is divided into a two-step and a one-step contributions, depending on the scaling dependence on the laser pulse duration. The corresponding contributions to the positron angular distribution spectra and the resulting interference terms are studied numerically emphasizing the possibility of measuring experimentally the contribution of the one-step contribution.",1
118864,2,"Gaining confidence on general relativity with cosmic polarization rotation The theory of general relativity, for which we celebrate the centennial at this Symposium, is based on the Einstein equivalence principle. This principle could be violated through a pseudoscalar-photon interaction, which would also produce a rotation of the polarization angle for radiation traveling over very long distances. Therefore, if we could show that this cosmic polarization rotation does not exist, our confindence in general relativity would be greatly increased. We review here the astrophysical searches for cosmic polarization rotation, which have been made in the past 26 years using the polarization of radio galaxies and of the cosmic microwave background. So far no rotation has been detected within about 1 degree. We discuss current problems and future prospects for cosmic polarization rotation measurements.",1

When ɛ≥0, the eigenvalues of this non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are discrete, real, and positive. This portion of parameter space is known as the region of unbroken PT symmetry. In the region of broken PT symmetry, ɛ<0, only a finite number of eigenvalues are real and the remaining eigenvalues appear as complex-conjugate pairs. The region of unbroken PT symmetry has been studied but the region of broken PT symmetry has thus far been unexplored. This paper presents a detailed numerical and analytical examination of the behavior of the eigenvalues for −4<ɛ<0.

Macroscopic properties, such baryonic and gravitational masses, of both types of stars are then obtained from the solution of the hydrostatic equilibrium equations.

For this purpose we use the basic notions of the calculus of 3-dimensional matrices, define the Z_2-graded (or super) structure of a cubic matrix relative to one of the directions of a cubic matrix and the super trace of a cubic supermatrix. Making use of the super trace of a cubic supermatrix we introduce the triple product of cubic supermatrices and find the identities for this triple product, where one of them can be regarded as the analog of ternary associativity. We also show that given a Lie algebra one can construct the $n$-ary Lie bracket by means of an (n-2)-cochain of given Lie algebra and find the conditions under which this n-ary bracket satisfies the Filippov-Jacobi identity, thereby inducing the structure of n-Lie algebra. We extend this approach to n-Lie superalgebras.",1

This spacetime becomes a Minkowski spacetime a finite distance away from each of the line singularities. The CTCs under investigation do not need to enter the singularities, and can be confined to regions that are weak-field.

The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the momentum and the boost parameter. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with the increase of the momentum of the state, as well as the boost applied to it.

119217,2,"Investigating the multifrequency pulse profiles of PSRs B0329+54 and B1642–03 in an inverse Compton scattering model Emission geometries, including emission region heights, beam shapes and radius-to-frequency mapping, are important clues for pulsar radiation models. Multiband radio observations reveal this valuable information. In this paper, we study two bright pulsars, PSRs B0329+54 and B1642−03, and observe them at high frequencies: 2.5, 5 and 8 GHz. The newly acquired data, together with historical archives, provide an atlas of multifrequency profiles spanning from 100 MHz to 10 GHz. We study the frequency evolution of pulse profiles as well as radiation regions using these data. First, we fit the pulse profiles with Gaussian functions to determine the phase of each component, and then we calculate the radiation altitudes of different emission components and radiation regions. We find that the inverse Compton scattering (ICS) model can reproduce the radiation geometry of these two pulsars. However, for PSR B0329+54, the radiation can be generated in either an annular gap (AG) or a core gap (CG), while the radiation of PSR B1642−03 can only be generated in a CG. This difference is caused by the inclination angle and the impact angle of these two pulsars. The relationship between the beaming angle (the angle between the radiation direction and the magnetic axis) and the radiation altitude versus frequency is also presented by modelling the beam–frequency evolution in the ICS model. The multiband pulse profiles of these two pulsars can be described well by the ICS model combined with the CG and AG.",1
119220,2,"Spin memory effect for compact binaries in the post-Newtonian approximation The spin memory effect is a recently predicted relativistic phenomenon in asymptotically flat spacetimes that become nonradiative infinitely far in the past and future. Between these early and late times, the magnetic-parity part of the time integral of the gravitational-wave strain can undergo a nonzero change; this difference is the spin memory effect. Families of freely falling observers around an isolated source can measure this effect, in principle, and fluxes of angular momentum per unit solid angle (or changes in superspin charges) generate the effect. The spin memory effect had not been computed explicitly for astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, such as compact binaries. In this paper, we compute the spin memory in terms of a set of radiative multipole moments of the gravitational-wave strain. The result of this calculation allows us to establish the following results about the spin memory: (i) We find that the accumulation of the spin memory behaves in a qualitatively different way from that of the displacement memory effect for nonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries in the post-Newtonian approximation: the spin memory undergoes a large secular growth over the duration of the inspiral, whereas for the displacement effect this increase is small. (ii) The rate at which the spin memory grows is equivalent to a nonlinear, but nonoscillatory and nonhereditary effect in the gravitational waveform that had been previously calculated for nonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries. (iii) This rate of buildup of the spin memory could potentially be detected by future gravitational-wave detectors by carefully combining the measured waveforms from hundreds of gravitational-wave detections of compact binaries.",1

It is shown that in symmetry protected topological phases, geometric defects or symmetry defects may carry projective Rep of the symmetry group; while in symmetry enriched topological phases, intrinsic excitations (such as spinons or visons) may carry projective Rep of the symmetry group.

We apply this in detail to smooth Deligne cohomology, differential topological complex K-theory, and to a smooth extension of integral Morava K-theory that we introduce.

119409,2,"Optimizing density down-ramp injection for beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators Density down-ramp (DDR) injection is a promising concept in beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators for the generation of high-quality witness beams. We review and complement the theoretical principles of the method and employ particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations in order to determine constrains on the geometry of the density ramp and the current of the drive beam, regarding the applicability of DDR injection. Furthermore, PIC simulations are utilized to find optimized conditions for the production of high-quality beams. We find and explain the intriguing result that the injection of an increased charge by means of a steepened ramp favors the generation of beams with lower emittance. Exploiting this fact enables the production of beams with high charge (∼140  pC), low normalized emittance (∼200  nm) and low uncorrelated energy spread (0.3%) in sufficiently steep ramps even for drive beams with moderate peak current (∼2.5  kA).",1

119520,2,"Particle acceleration in the superwinds of starburst galaxies Starbursts are galaxies undergoing massive episodes of star formation. The combined effect of stellar winds from hot stars and supernova explosions creates a high-temperature cavity in the nuclear region of these objects. The very hot gas expands adiabatically and escapes from the galaxy creating a superwind which sweeps matter from the galactic disk. The superwind region in the halo is filled with a multi-phase gas with hot, warm, cool, and relativistic components. The shocks associated with the superwind of starbursts and the turbulent gas region of the bubble inflated by them might accelerate cosmic rays up to high energies. In this work we calculate the cosmic ray production associated with the superwind using parameters that correspond to the nearby southern starburst galaxy NGC 253, which has been suggested as a potential accelerator of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We evaluate the efficiency of both diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and stochastic diffusive acceleration (SDA) in the superwind of NGC 253. We estimate the distribution of both hadrons and leptons and calculate the corresponding spectral energy distributions of photons. We find that the strong mass load of the superwind, recently determined through ALMA observations, strongly attenuates the efficiency of DSA in NGC 253, whereas SDA is constrained by the age of the starburst. We conclude that NGC 253 and similar starbursts can only accelerate iron nuclei beyond $\sim10^{18}$ eV under very special conditions. If the central region of the galaxy harbors a starved supermassive black hole of $\sim10^6$ $M_{\odot}$, as suggested by some recent observations, a contribution in the range $10^{18}-10^{19}$ eV can be present for accretion rates $\dot{m}\sim10^{-3}$ in Eddington units. Only if very strong magnetic field amplification occurs close to the superwind shock energies of the order of 100 EeV might be achieved.",1
119532,2,"Skyrmions - beyond rigid body quantisation In the Skyrme model, nuclei are described as topological solitons known as Skyrmions. To make contact with nuclear data one must quantise these Skyrmions; most calculations to date have used rigid body quantisation, where the Skyrmions are allowed to rotate but remain rigid. The method reproduces some experimental results for light nuclei but there are some contradictions with data. In this thesis we study a more sophisticated quantisation scheme where the Skyrmions may deform, called vibrational quantisation, in the hope of fixing some of these problems. Vibrational quantisation is applied to the dodecahedral $B=7$ Skyrmion, which models Lithium-$7$. Using rigid body quantisation, the Skyrme model predicts a spin $\frac{7}{2}$ ground state while in reality the Lithium-$7$ nucleus ground state has spin $\frac{3}{2}$. We show that a quantisation which includes a $5$-dimensional vibrational manifold of deformed Skyrme configurations remedies this problem, giving the correct ground state spin. Further, the model leads to a robust prediction that the ground state of the nucleus has a larger root mean square matter radius than the second quantum state, in contrast with standard nuclear models.We consider the vibrational modes of the tetrahedral $B=16$ Skyrmion, to describe Oxygen-$16$. Motivated by Skyrme dynamics, a special $2$-dimensional submanifold of configurations is constructed. We study the manifold in detail by modelling it as a $6$-punctured sphere with constant negative curvature. The Schr\""odinger equation is solved on the sphere and the results give an excellent fit to the experimental energy spectrum. The model describes an energy splitting between certain states with equal spins but opposite parities, which is hard to explain in other models. We also find the first ever isospin $0$, spin-parity $0^-$ state in the Skyrme model. A method to calculate electromagnetic transition rates between states is formulated and then applied to our system.By considering a special type of Skyrme configuration, where a single Skyrmion orbits a large core, we show that the Skyrme model can reproduce a classical spin-orbit force due to the structure of the Skyrme fields. We quantise this model to try and find out if the classical picture holds quantum mechanically.",1

119632,2,"Electron Track Reconstruction and Improved Modulation for Photoelectric X-ray Polarimetry The key to photoelectric X-ray polarimetry is the determination of the emission direction of photoelectrons. Because of the low mass of an electron, the ionisation trajectory is not straight and the useful information needed for polarimetry is stored mostly in the initial part of the track where less energy is deposited. We present a new algorithm, based on the shortest path problem in graph theory, to reconstruct the 2D electron track from the measured image that is blurred due to transversal diffusion along drift and multiplication in the gas chamber. Compared with previous methods based on moment analysis, this algorithm allows us to identify the photoelectric interaction point more accurately and precisely for complicated tracks resulting from high energy photons or low pressure chambers. This leads to a better position resolution and a higher degree of modulation toward high energy X-rays. The new algorithm is justified using simulations and measurements with the gas pixel detector (GPD), and it should also work for other polarimetric techniques such as a time projection chamber (TPC). As the improvement is restricted in the high energy band, this new algorithm shows limited improvement for the sensitivity of GPD polarimeters, but it may have a larger potential for low-pressure TPC polarimeters.",1

In this paper, we study the feasibility of a two-pass recirculating proton linear accelerator through the direct numerical beam dynamics design optimization and the start-to-end simulation. This study shows that the two-pass simultaneous focusing without particle losses is attainable including fully 3D space-charge effects through the entire accelerator system.",1

119733,2,"On integrability of the Killing equation Killing tensor fields have been thought of as describing the hidden symmetry of space(-time) since they are in one-to-one correspondence with polynomial first integrals of geodesic equations. Since many problems in classical mechanics can be formulated as geodesic problems in curved space and spacetime, solving the defining equation for Killing tensor fields (the Killing equation) is a powerful way to integrate equations of motion. Thus it has been desirable to formulate the integrability conditions of the Killing equation, which serve to determine the number of linearly independent solutions and also to restrict the possible forms of solutions tightly. In this paper, we show the prolongation for the Killing equation in a manner that uses Young symmetrizers. Using the prolonged equations, we provide the integrability conditions explicitly.",1

Indeed, it is not clear whether it is due to a central intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or to a massive stellar system (MSS) composed of mass segregated stars. In this contribution we present a semi-analytic approach to the problem complemented by 12 $N$-body simulations in which we followed the formation of MSSs in GCs with masses up to $3\times 10^5$ \Ms. Some implications for the formation of IMBHs and gravitational waves emission are discussed in perspective of a future work.",1
119798,2,"High energy tails of pulsar gamma-ray emission We perform spectral analyses of four bright $\gamma$-ray pulsars: PSR J0007+7303, Vela, Geminga and PSR J2021+3651 concentrating on the high-energy tails, defined as emission above 10\,GeV. The two competing models of pulsar $\gamma$-ray emission predict qualitatively different spectra well above the break energy: curvature emission predicts an exponential cut-off in the spectra, while the inverse-Compton scattering mechanism favors a power-law. We perform fits to the phase-averaged spectral energy distributions for each of the four pulsars. We find that in all cases both models fit the data equally well---the present data set does not allow any firm claim to be made about the shape of the spectra above 10\,GeV. In no case is the power-law fit or exponential cut-off fit significantly preferred over the other. The Crab pulsar remains the only known pulsar in which the power-law fit is clearly preferred over the exponential cut-off.",1
119808,2,"Extragalactic gamma-ray background from AGN winds and star-forming galaxies in cosmological galaxy formation models We derive the contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) from active galactic nuclei (AGN) winds and star-forming galaxies by including a physical model for the γ-ray emission produced by relativistic protons accelerated by AGN-driven and supernova-driven shocks into a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. This is based on galaxy interactions as triggers of AGN accretion and starburst activity and on expanding blast waves as the mechanism to communicate outwards the energy injected into the interstellar medium by the active nucleus. We compare the model predictions with the latest measurement of the EGB spectrum performed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) in the range between 100 MeV and 820 GeV. We find that AGN winds can provide ~35 ± 15% of the observed EGB in the energy interval Eγ = 0.1–1 GeV, for ~73 ± 15% at Eγ = 1–10 GeV, and for ~60 ± 20% at Eγ ≳10 GeV. The AGN wind contribution to the EGB is predicted to be larger by a factor of ~3–5 than that provided by star-forming galaxies (quiescent plus starburst) in the hierarchical clustering scenario. The cumulative γ-ray emission from AGN winds and blazars can account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the EGB, assuming the standard acceleration theory, and AGN wind parameters that agree with observations. We also compare the model prediction for the cumulative neutrino background from AGN winds with the most recent IceCube data. We find that for AGN winds with accelerated proton spectral index p = 2.2–2.3, and taking into account internal absorption of γ-rays, the Fermi-LAT and IceCube data could be reproduced simultaneously.

119916,2,"A Nova Outburst Powered by Shocks Classical novae are runaway thermonuclear burning events on the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs in close binary star systems, sometimes appearing as new naked-eye sources in the night sky 1 . The standard model of novae predicts that their optical luminosity derives from energy released near the hot white dwarf, which is reprocessed through the ejected material 2$^{–}$5 . Recent studies using the Fermi Large Area Telescope have shown that many classical novae are accompanied by gigaelectronvolt γ-ray emission 6$^{,}$7 . This emission likely originates from strong shocks, providing new insights into the properties of nova outflows and allowing them to be used as laboratories for the study of the unknown efficiency of particle acceleration in shocks. Here, we report γ-ray and optical observations of the Milky Way nova ASASSN-16ma, which is among the brightest novae ever detected in γ-rays. The γ-ray and optical light curves show a remarkable correlation, implying that the majority of the optical light comes from reprocessed emission from shocks rather than the white dwarf 8 . The ratio of γ-ray to optical flux in ASASSN-16ma directly constrains the acceleration efficiency of non-thermal particles to be around 0.005, favouring hadronic models for the γ-ray emission 9 . The need to accelerate particles up to energies exceeding 100 gigaelectronvolts provides compelling evidence for magnetic field amplification in the shocks.",1

Such a system displays a quantum critical point between the semimetallic and an s-wave superconducting phase at which the low-energy “Luttinger fermions” are inextricably coupled to the order parameter fluctuations. The quantum critical point is perturbatively accessible near four spatial dimensions, where it features nontrivial scaling with dynamical exponent 1<z<2 and emergent rotational and particle-hole symmetries. Some features of the criticality, such as oscillatory corrections to scaling and its enhanced symmetry, are discussed.",1
119979,2,"Extension of photon surfaces and their area: Static and stationary spacetimes We propose a new concept, the transversely trapping surface (TTS), as an extension of the static photon surface characterizing the strong gravity region of a static/stationary spacetime in terms of photon behavior. The TTS is defined as a static/stationary timelike surface $$S$$ whose spatial section is a closed two-surface, such that arbitrary photons emitted tangentially to $$S$$ from arbitrary points on $$S$$ propagate on or toward the inside of $$S$$. We study the properties of TTSs for static spacetimes and axisymmetric stationary spacetimes. In particular, the area $$A_0$$ of a TTS is proved to be bounded as $$A_0\le 4\pi(3GM)^2$$ under certain conditions, where $$G$$ is the Newton constant and $$M$$ is the total mass. The connection between the TTS and the loosely trapped surface proposed by us [Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2017, 033E01 (2017)] is also examined.",1
120001,2,"Deriving analytic solutions for compact binary inspirals without recourse to adiabatic approximations We utilize the dynamical renormalization group formalism to calculate the real space trajectory of a compact binary inspiral for long times via a systematic resummation of secularly growing terms. This method generates closed form solutions without orbit averaging, and the accuracy can be systematically improved. The expansion parameter is v5νΩ(t-t0) where t0 is the initial time, t is the time elapsed, and Ω and v are the angular orbital frequency and initial speed, respectively. ν is the binary’s symmetric mass ratio. We demonstrate how to apply the renormalization group method to resum solutions beyond leading order in two ways. First, we calculate the second-order corrections of the leading radiation reaction force, which involves highly nontrivial checks of the formalism (i.e., its renormalizability). Second, we show how to systematically include post-Newtonian corrections to the radiation reaction force. By avoiding orbit averaging, we gain predictive power and eliminate ambiguities in the initial conditions. Finally, we discuss how this methodology can be used to find analytic solutions to the spin equations of motion that are valid over long times.",1
120130,2,Quantum-classical transition in the Caldeira-Leggett model The quantum–classical transition in the Caldeira–Leggett model is investigated in the framework of the functional renormalization group method. It is shown that a divergent quadratic term arises in the action due to the heat bath in the model.

The critical exponents belonging to the susceptibility and the correlation length are determined and their independence of the frequency cutoff and the renormalization scheme is shown.,1
120158,2,"Spinning particles in general relativity: Momentum-velocity relation for the Mathisson-Pirani spin condition The Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, providing the “pole-dipole” description of spinning test particles in general relativity, have to be supplemented by a condition specifying the worldline that will represent the history of the studied body. It has long been thought that the Mathisson-Pirani (MP) spin condition—unlike other major choices made in the literature—does not yield an explicit momentum-velocity relation. We derive here the desired (and very simple) relation and show that it is in fact equivalent to the MP condition. We clarify the apparent paradox between the existence of such a definite relation and the known fact that the MP condition is degenerate (does not specify a unique worldline), thus shedding light on some conflicting statements made in the literature. We then show how, for a given body, this spin condition yields infinitely many possible representative worldlines, and derive a detailed method how to switch between them in a curved spacetime. The MP condition is a convenient choice in situations when it is easy to recognize its “nonhelical” solution, as exemplified here by bodies in circular orbits and in radial fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime.",1
120166,2,Strong subadditivity for log-determinant of covariance matrices and its applications We prove that the log-determinant of the covariance matrix obeys the strong subadditivity inequality for arbitrary tripartite states of multimode continuous variable quantum systems. This establishes general limitations on the distribution of information encoded in the second moments of canonically conjugate operators. The inequality is shown to be stronger than the conventional strong subadditivity inequality for von Neumann entropy in a class of pure tripartite Gaussian states. We finally show that such an inequality implies a strict monogamy-type constraint for joint Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen steerability of single modes by Gaussian measurements performed on multiple groups of modes.,1

The calculations are made for strongly-interacting matter composed of alpha particles. The phase diagram of this matter is qualitatively similar to that observed for the atomic He4 liquid.

120181,2,"Lifshitz transitions via the type-II dirac and type-II Weyl points The type-II Weyl and type-II Dirac points emerge in semimetals and in relativistic systems. In particular, the type-II Weyl fermions may emerge behind the event horizon of black holes. The type-II Weyl and Dirac points also emerge as the intermediate states of the topological Lifshitz transitions. In one case, the type-II Weyl point connects the Fermi pockets, and the Lifshitz transition corresponds to the transfer of the Berry flux between the Fermi pockets. In the other case, the type-II Weyl point connects the outer and inner Fermi surfaces. At the Lifshitz transition, the Weyl point is released from both Fermi surfaces. They loose their Berry flux, which guarantees the global stability, and without the topological support, the inner surface disappears after shrinking to a point at the second Lifshitz transition. These examples reveal the complexity and universality of topological Lifshitz transitions, which originate from the ubiquitous interplay of a variety of topological characters of the momentum-space manifolds.",1
120225,2,"Observation of Electron Cloud Instabilities and Emittance Dilution at the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring Test Accelerator Electron cloud related emittance dilution and instabilities of bunch trains limit the performance of high intensity circular colliders. One of the key goals of the Cornell electron-positron storage ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA) research program is to improve our understanding of how the electron cloud alters the dynamics of bunches within the train. Single bunch beam diagnotics have been developed to measure the beam spectra, vertical beam size, two important dynamical effects of beams interacting with the electron cloud, for bunch trains on a turn-by-turn basis. Experiments have been performed at CesrTA to probe the interaction of the electron cloud with stored positron bunch trains. The purpose of these experiments was to characterize the dependence of beam-electron cloud interactions on the machine parameters such as bunch spacing, vertical chromaticity, and bunch current. The beam dynamics of the stored beam, in the presence of the electron cloud, was quantified using: 1) a gated beam position monitor (BPM) and spectrum analyzer to measure the bunch-by-bunch frequency spectrum of the bunch trains, 2) an x-ray beam size monitor to record the bunch-by-bunch, turn-by-turn vertical size of each bunch within the trains. In this paper we report on the observations from these experiments and analyze the effects of the electron cloud on the stability of bunches in a train under many different operational conditions.",1
120270,2,"Fundamental frequencies and resonances from eccentric and precessing binary black hole inspirals Binary black holes which are both eccentric and undergo precession remain unexplored in numerical simulations. We present simulations of such systems which cover about 50 orbits at comparatively high mass ratios 5 and 7. The configurations correspond to the generic motion of a nonspinning body in a Kerr spacetime, and are chosen to study the transition from finite mass-ratio inspirals to point particle motion in Kerr. We develop techniques to extract analogs of the three fundamental frequencies of Kerr geodesics, compare our frequencies to those of Kerr, and show that the differences are consistent with self-force corrections entering at first order in mass ratio. This analysis also locates orbital resonances where the ratios of our frequencies take rational values. At the considered mass ratios, the binaries pass through resonances in one to two resonant cycles, and we find no discernible effects on the orbital evolution. We also compute the decay of eccentricity during the inspiral and find good agreement with the leading order post-Newtonian prediction.",1
120292,2,An exact solution to the Bertsch problem and the non-universality of the Unitary Fermi Gas We analyze the universality of the Unitary Fermi Gas in its ground state from a Wilsonian renormalization point of view and compute the effective range dependence of the Bertsch parameter $\xi$ exactly. To this end we construct an effective block-diagonal two-body separable interaction with the Fermi momentum as a cut-off which reduces the calculation to the mean field level. The interaction is separable in momentum space and is determined by Tabakin's inverse scattering formula. For a vanishing effective range we get $\xi = \frac{176}{9 \pi }-\frac{17}{3} = 0.56$. By using phase-equivalent similarity transformations we can show that there is a class of exact solutions with any value in the range $ 0.56 \ge \xi \ge -1/3$.,1

While the pf-subshell (or d˜s-subshell, i.e. η˜=2,s˜1/2,d˜3/2,d˜5/2) is governed by the SU˜S˜T(4)⊗U˜L˜(6)symmetry, the g9/2 intruder state is governed by the seniority model.

120453,2,"Unitarity, feedback, interactions—dynamics emergent from repeated measurements Motivated by the recent efforts to describe the gravitational interaction as a classical channel arising from continuous quantum measurements, we study what types of dynamics can emerge from a collisional model of repeated interactions between a system and a set of ancillae. We show that contingent on the model parameters the resulting dynamics ranges from exact unitarity to arbitrarily fast decoherence (quantum Zeno effect). For a series of measurements the effective dynamics includes feedback-control, which for a composite system yields effective interactions between the subsystems. We quantify the amount of decoherence accompanying such induced interactions, generalizing the lower bound found for the gravitational example. However, by allowing multipartite measurements, we show that interactions can be induced with arbitrarily low decoherence. These results have implications for gravity-inspired decoherence models. Moreover, we show how the framework can include terms beyond the usual second-order approxiation, which can spark new quantum control or simulation protocols. Finally, within our simple approach we re-derive the quantum filtering equations for the different regimes of effective dynamics, which can facilitate new connections between different formulations of open systems.",1

In the past, many authors proposed solutions based on stacking subsequently layers of dispersive elements and recording multiple spectra in one shot (multiplexing). Although this idea is promising, it brings several drawbacks and complexities that prevent the straightforward integration of such a device in a spectrograph. Fortunately, nowadays, the situation has changed dramatically, thanks to the successful experience achieved through photopolymeric holographic films, used to fabricate common volume-phase holographic gratings (VPHGs). Thanks to the various advantages made available by these materials in this context, we propose an innovative solution to design a stacked multiplexed VPHG that is able to secure efficiently different spectra in a single shot. This allows us to increase resolution and spectral range enabling astronomers to greatly economize their awarded time at the telescope.

In this paper, we revisit the Novikov–Thorne accretion thin disc model and find a new self-similar radiation-dominated solution in the extremely high spin regime. Motivated by the self-consistency of the model, we require that matter flows at the sound speed at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We observe that, when the disc pressure is dominated by radiation at the ISCO, which occurs for the best-fitting Novikov–Thorne model of GRS 1915+105, the Shakura–Sunyaev viscosity parameter can be expressed in terms of the spin, mass accretion rate and radiative efficiency.

120606,2,"Origin of the Universe from a black hole: a theoretical model A consistent theoretical model describing expansion of the universe from a central spherical uncharged Schwarzschild black hole is formulated with some modifications. The behaviour of the time dependent conformal factor, which is the temporal part of the geometric mass of the black hole, is studied exhaustively in the different stages of the expansion. The concept of the dimensionless radius of the core black hole embedded by the space-time emerges from this formulation. It is interpreted that the nature of such dimensionless radius plays a key role to govern the acceleration or deceleration of the universe. An inverse proportionality relation between the conformal factor and the scale factor is derived from the idea that the strength of the core black hole gets lowered to result in an accelerated expansion of space-time. The nature of the conformal factor and its effect towards the dynamics of the universe is established at different stages of expansion.",1

The plasma acts as a ""switching medium"", where the trapped electrons first obtain angular momentum from the drive laser pulse and then transfer it to the {\gamma}-photons via nonlinear Compton scattering. Further through the multiphoton Breit-Wheeler process, dense energetic positron beams are efficiently generated, whose angular momentum can be well controlled by laser-plasma interactions. This opens up a promising and feasible way to produce ultra-bright GeV {\gamma}-photons and positron beams with desirable angular momentum for a wide range of scientific research and applications.",1

120896,2,"Spherically symmetric isothermal fluids in $f(R,T)$ gravity We analyze the isothermal property in static fluid spheres within the framework of the modified $f(R, T)$ theory of gravitation. The equation of pressure isotropy of the standard Einstein theory is preserved however, the energy density and pressure are expressed in terms of both gravitational potentials. Invoking the isothermal prescription requires that the isotropy condition assumes the role of a consistency condition and an exact model generalizing that of general relativity is found. Moreover it is found that the Einstein model is unstable and acausal while the $f(R, T)$ counterpart is well behaved on account of the freedom available through an additional coupling constant. The case of a constant spatial gravitational potential is considered and the complete model is determined. This model is markedly different from its Einstein counterpart which is known to be isothermal. Dropping the restriction on the density and imposing a linear barotropic equation of state generates an exact solution and consequently a stellar distribution as the vanishing of the pressure is possible and a boundary hypersurface exists. Finally we comment on the case of relaxing the equation of state but demanding an inverse square fall-off of the density - this case proves intractable.",1
120899,2,"Characterizing the population of pulsars in the inner Galaxy with the Fermi Large Area Telescope An excess of $\gamma$-ray emission from the Galactic Center (GC) region with respect to predictions based on a variety of interstellar emission models and $\gamma$-ray source catalogs has been found by many groups using data from the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT). Several interpretations of this excess have been invoked. In this paper we search for members of an unresolved population of $\gamma$-ray pulsars located in the inner Galaxy that are predicted by the interpretation of the GC excess as being due to a population of such sources. We use cataloged LAT sources to derive criteria that efficiently select pulsars with very small contamination from blazars. We search for point sources in the inner $40^\circ\times40^\circ$ region of the Galaxy, derive a list of approximately 400 sources, and apply pulsar selection criteria to extract pulsar candidates among our source list. We performed the entire data analysis chain with two different interstellar emission models (IEMs), and found a total of 135 pulsar candidates, of which 66 were selected with both IEMs.",1
120903,2,"Nonlinear Compton scattering in a strong rotating electric field The nonlinear Compton scattering rate in a rotating electric field is explicitly calculated. For this purpose, an approximate solution to the Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of a rotating electric field is applied. An analytical expression for the emission rate is obtained, as well as a simplified approximation adequate for implementation in kinetic codes. The spectrum is numerically calculated for present-day optical and x-ray laser parameters. The results are compared to the standard Volkov-Ritus rate for a particle in a plane wave, which is commonly assumed to be valid for a rotating electric field under certain conditions. Substantial deviations between the two models, in both the radiated power and the spectral shape, are demonstrated. First, the typical number of photons participating in the scattering process is much smaller compared to the Volkov-Ritus rate, resulting in up to an order of magnitude lower emitted power. Furthermore, our model predicts a discrete harmonic spectrum for electrons with low asymptotic momentum compared to the field amplitude. This discrete structure is a clear imprint of the electric field frequency, as opposed to the Volkov-Ritus rate, which reduces to the constant crossed field rate for the physical conditions under consideration. Our model predictions can be tested with present-day laser facilities.",1
120951,2,"Periodic Poisson model for beam dynamics simulation A method is described to solve the Poisson problem for a three dimensional source distribution that is periodic into one direction. Perpendicular to the direction of periodicity a free space (or open) boundary condition is realized. In beam physics, this approach allows us to calculate the space charge field of a continualized charged particle distribution with periodic pattern. The method is based on a particle-mesh approach with equidistant grid and fast convolution with a Green’s function. The periodic approach uses only one period of the source distribution, but a periodic extension of the Green’s function. The approach is numerically efficient and allows the investigation of periodic- and pseudoperiodic structures with period lengths that are small compared to the source dimensions, for instance of laser modulated beams or of the evolution of micro bunch structures. Applications for laser modulated beams are given.",1

121086,2,"Electron tunneling times Tunneling is one of the most bizarre phenomena in quantum mechanics. An attempt to understand it led to the next natural question of how long does a particle need to tunnel a barrier. The latter gave rise to several definitions such as the phase, dwell, Larmor and traversal times among others. A short review of the evolution of these time concepts, followed by an account of experiments involving field-induced tunnel ionization and electron tunneling in a solid state junction is presented here. Whereas the former experiments use sophisticated techniques involving femtosecond laser pulses and determine the tunneling time by mapping the angle of rotation of the field vector to time, like the hands of a watch, the latter provides a simpler method through the measurement of current-voltage characteristics of the junction.",1
121090,2,"On the bound states and correlation functions of a class of Calogero-type quantum many-body problems with balanced loss and gain The quantization of many-body systems with balanced loss and gain is investigated. Two types of models characterized by either translational invariance or rotational symmetry under rotation in a pseudo-Euclidean space are considered. A partial set of integrals of motion are constructed for each type of model. Specific examples for the translationally invariant systems include Calogero-type many-body systems with balanced loss and gain, where each particle is interacting with other particles via four-body inverse-square potential plus pair-wise two-body harmonic terms. A many-body system interacting via short range four-body plus six-body inverse square potential with pair-wise two-body harmonic terms in presence of balanced loss and gain is also considered. In general, the eigen values of these two models contain quantized as well as continuous spectra. A completely quantized spectra and bound states involving all the particles may be obtained by employing box-normalization on the particles having continuous spectra. The normalization of the ground state wave functions in appropriate Stoke wedges is discussed. The exact n-particle correlation functions of these two models are obtained through a mapping of the relevant integrals to known results in random matrix theory. It is shown that a rotationally symmetric system with generic many-body potential does not have entirely real spectra, leading to unstable quantum modes. The eigenvalue problem of a Hamiltonian system with balanced loss and gain and admitting dynamical O(2, 1) symmetry is also considered.",1
121154,2,"Many-body topological invariants for fermionic short-range entangled topological phases protected by antiunitary symmetries We present a fully many-body formulation of topological invariants for various topological phases of fermions protected by antiunitary symmetry, which does not refer to single particle wave functions. For example, we construct the many-body $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant for time-reversal symmetric topological insulators in two spatial dimensions, which is a many-body counterpart of the Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant written in terms of single-particle Bloch wave functions. We show that an important ingredient for the construction of the many-body topological invariants is a fermionic partial transpose which is basically the standard partial transpose equipped with a sign structure to account for anti-commuting property of fermion operators. We also report some basic results on various kinds of pin structures -- a key concept behind our strategy for constructing many-body topological invariants -- such as the obstructions, isomorphism classes, and Dirac quantization conditions.",1
121260,2,"Multi-resolution Bayesian CMB component separation through Wiener-filtering with a pseudo-inverse preconditioner We present a Bayesian model for multi-resolution CMB component separation based on Wiener filtering and/or computation of constrained realizations, extending a previously developed framework. We also develop an efficient solver for the corresponding linear system for the associated signal amplitudes. The core of this new solver is an efficient preconditioner based on the pseudo-inverse of the coefficient matrix of the linear system. In the full sky coverage case, the method gives a speed-up of 2--3x in compute time compared to a simple diagonal preconditioner, and it is easier to implement in terms of practical computer code. In the case where a mask is applied and prior-driven constrained realization is sought within the mask, this is the first time full convergence has been achieved at the full resolution of the Planck dataset.

121276,2,"Strain induced Chiral Magnetic Effect in Weyl semimetals We argue that strain applied to a time-reversal and inversion breaking Weyl semimetal in a magnetic field can induce an electric current via the chiral magnetic effect. A tight-binding model is used to show that strain generically changes the locations in the Brillouin zone but also the energies of the band touching points (tips of the Weyl cones). Since axial charge in a Weyl semimetal can relax via intervalley scattering processes, the induced current will decay with a time scale given by the lifetime of a chiral quasiparticle. We estimate the strength and lifetime of the current for typical material parameters and find that it should be experimentally observable.",1
121282,2,"Investigation of in-house superconducting radio-frequency 9-cell cavity made of large grain niobium at KEK The first in-house, 9-cell, superconducting radio-frequency cavity made of large grain Nb was fabricated at KEK. Some characteristic techniques were employed for the fabrication that were not used for fine grain (FG) Nb. Even though a penetrated hole was created during electron beam welding, it was successfully repaired and did not affect the cavity performance. The completed cavity then underwent vertical tests (VTs) via several surface treatment processes. A defect that caused quenches was found after a VT at 25 mm from the equator where the typical local grinding machine developed at KEK could not be utilized. A new local grinding machine using a 3D printer was thus developed for the first time, and it completely removed this defect. Finally, the cavity achieved a maximum Q0 value of 3.8 × 10 10 and accelerating gradient of 38 MV/m. The obtained Q0 value is about 1.5 times higher than that for the KEK in-house FG cavity.",1
121290,2,"The impact of neutral impurity concentration on charge drift mobility in p-type germanium We reported a new result of the neutral impurity scattering of holes that has impact on the charge drift mobility in high purity p-type germanium crystals at 77 Kelvin. The charge carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity are measured by Hall Effect system at 77 Kelvin. We investigated the contribution to the total charge drift mobility from ionized impurity scattering, lattice scattering, and neutral impurity scattering with the best theoretical models and experimental data. Several samples with measured Hall mobility from the grown crystals are used for this investigation. With the measured Hall mobility and ionized impurity concentration as well as the theoretical models, we calculated the neutral impurity concentration by the Matthiessen's rule. As a result, the distributions of the neutral impurity concentrations with respect to the radius of the crystals are obtained. Consequently, we demonstrated that neutral impurity scattering is a significant contribution to the charge drift mobility, which has dependence on the concentration of neutral impurities in a given germanium crystal.",1
121294,2,"Confinement transition to density wave order in metallic doped spin liquids Insulating quantum spin liquids can undergo a confinement transition to a valence bond solid via the condensation of topological excitations of the associated gauge theory. We extend the theory of such transitions to fractionalized Fermi liquids (FL*): These are metallic doped spin liquids in which the Fermi surfaces only have gauge neutral quasiparticles. Using insights from a duality transform on a doped quantum dimer model for the U(1)-FL* state, we show that projective symmetry group of the theory of the topological excitations remains unmodified, but the Fermi surfaces can lead to additional frustrating interactions. We propose a theory for the confinement transition of Z2-FL* states via the condensation of visons. A variety of confining, incommensurate density wave states are possible, including some that are similar to the incommensurate d-form factor density wave order observed in several recent experiments on the cuprate superconductors.",1
121333,2,"The Profinite Dimensional Manifold Structure of Formal Solution Spaces of Formally Integrable PDEs In this paper, we study the formal solution space of a nonlinear PDE in a fiber bundle. To this end, we start with foundational material and introduce the notion of a pfd structure to build up a new concept of profinite dimensional manifolds. We show that the infinite jet space of the fiber bundle is a profinite dimensional manifold in a natural way. The formal solution space of the nonlinear PDE then is a subspace of this jet space, and inherits from it the structure of a profinite dimensional manifold, if the PDE is formally integrable. We apply our concept to scalar PDEs and prove a new criterion for formal integrability of such PDEs. In particular, this result entails that the Euler-Lagrange equation of a relativistic scalar field with a polynomial self-interaction is formally integrable.",1
121350,2,"Entanglement and Majorana edge states in the Kitaev model We investigate the von Neumann entanglement entropy and Schmidt gap in the vortex-free ground state of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice for square/rectangular and cylindrical subsystems. We find that, for both the subsystems, the free-fermionic contribution to the entanglement entropy SE exhibits signatures of the phase transitions between the gapless and gapped phases. However, within the gapless phase, we find that SE does not show an expected monotonic behavior as a function of the coupling Jz between the suitably defined one-dimensional chains for either geometry; moreover, the system generically reaches a point of minimum entanglement within the gapless phase before the entanglement saturates or increases again until the gapped phase is reached. This may be attributed to the onset of gapless modes in the bulk spectrum and the competition between the correlation functions along various bonds. In the gapped phase, on the other hand, SE always monotonically varies with Jz independent of the subregion size or shape. Finally, further confirming the Li-Haldane conjecture, we find that the Schmidt gap Δ defined from the entanglement spectrum also signals the topological transitions but only if there are corresponding zero-energy Majorana edge states that simultaneously appear or disappear across the transitions. We analytically corroborate some of our results on entanglement entropy, the Schmidt gap, and the bulk-edge correspondence using perturbation theory.",1

In such high-intensity accelerators, the operational beam intensity is limited to keep worker exposure to the residual dose within acceptable tolerances. Therefore, we continue to pursue accelerator commissioning that reduces beam loss. In order to achieve further high-intensity operation, the J-PARC accelerator system has been drastically upgraded over the past two years. As a result, it was found that beam loss decreased, whereas output power increased; the residual doses were kept at the same level or decreased in RCS. A malfunction of a collimator occurred in April 2016, and we replaced it to a spare duct in a hurry. The broken collimator was higher activated, but exposure to workers was kept within the acceptable level.",1
121411,2,"Testing the Cosmic Anisotropy with Supernovae Data: Hemisphere Comparison and Dipole Fitting The cosmological principle is one of the cornerstones in modern cosmology. It assumes that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on cosmic scales. Both the homogeneity and the isotropy of the universe should be tested carefully. In the present work, we are interested in probing the possible preferred direction in the distribution of type Ia supernovae (SNIa). To our best knowledge, two main methods have been used in almost all of the relevant works in the literature, namely the hemisphere comparison (HC) method and the dipole fitting (DF) method. However, the results from these two methods are not always approximately coincident with each other. In this work, we test the cosmic anisotropy by using these two methods with the joint light-curve analysis (JLA) and simulated SNIa data sets. In many cases, both methods work well, and their results are consistent with each other. However, in the cases with two (or even more) preferred directions, the DF method fails while the HC method still works well. This might shed new light on our understanding of these two methods.",1
121412,2,"Planck intermediate results. LI. Features in the cosmic microwave background temperature power spectrum and shifts in cosmological parameters The six parameters of the standard ΛCDM model have best-fit values derived from the Planck temperature power spectrum that are shifted somewhat from the best-fit values derived from WMAP data. These shifts are driven by features in the Planck temperature power spectrum at angular scales that had never before been measured to cosmic-variance level precision. We have investigated these shifts to determine whether they are within the range of expectation and to understand their origin in the data. Taking our parameter set to be the optical depth of the reionized intergalactic medium τ, the baryon density ωb, the matter density ωm, the angular size of the sound horizon θ∗, the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, ns, and Ase− 2τ (where As is the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum), we have examined the change in best-fit values between a WMAP-like large angular-scale data set (with multipole moment ℓ < 800 in the Planck temperature power spectrum) and an all angular-scale data set (ℓ < 2500Planck temperature power spectrum), each with a prior on τ of 0.07 ± 0.02. We find that the shifts, in units of the 1σ expected dispersion for each parameter, are { Δτ,ΔAse− 2τ,Δns,Δωm,Δωb,Δθ∗ } = { −1.7,−2.2,1.2,−2.0,1.1,0.9 }, with a χ2 value of 8.0. We find that this χ2 value is exceeded in 15% of our simulated data sets, and that a parameter deviates by more than 2.2σ in 9% of simulated data sets, meaning that the shifts are not unusually large. Comparing ℓ < 800 instead to ℓ> 800, or splitting at a different multipole, yields similar results. We examined the ℓ < 800 model residuals in the ℓ> 800 power spectrum data and find that the features there that drive these shifts are a set of oscillations across a broad range of angular scales. Although they partly appear similar to the effects of enhanced gravitational lensing, the shifts in ΛCDM parameters that arise in response to these features correspond to model spectrum changes that are predominantly due to non-lensing effects; the only exception is τ, which, at fixed Ase− 2τ, affects the ℓ> 800 temperature power spectrum solely through the associated change in As and the impact of that on the lensing potential power spectrum. We also ask, “what is it about the power spectrum at ℓ < 800 that leads to somewhat different best-fit parameters than come from the full ℓ range?” We find that if we discard the data at ℓ < 30, where there is a roughly 2σ downward fluctuation in power relative to the model that best fits the full ℓ range, the ℓ < 800 best-fit parameters shift significantly towards the ℓ < 2500 best-fit parameters. In contrast, including ℓ < 30, this previously noted “low-ℓ deficit” drives ns up and impacts parameters correlated with ns, such as ωm and H0. As expected, the ℓ < 30 data have a much greater impact on the ℓ < 800 best fit than on the ℓ < 2500 best fit. So although the shifts are not very significant, we find that they can be understood through the combined effects of an oscillatory-like set of high-ℓ residuals and the deficit in low-ℓ power, excursions consistent with sample variance that happen to map onto changes in cosmological parameters. Finally, we examine agreement between PlanckTT data and two other CMB data sets, namely the Planck lensing reconstruction and the TT power spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope, again finding a lack of convincing evidence of any significant deviations in parameters, suggesting that current CMB data sets give an internally consistent picture of the ΛCDM model.Key words: cosmology: observations / cosmic background radiation / cosmological parameters / cosmology: theory",1

The model self-consistently takes into account the electromagnetic field generated by the RF coil, the external static magnetic fields and the resulting plasma response, including a kinetic description of the charged species (e$^−$, H$^+$, H$^+_2$, H$^+_3$, H$^−$), as well as the atomic and molecular (vibrationally resolved) populations. The simulation is performed for the nominal operational condition of 40 kW RF power and 3 Pa H2 pressure. Results show that the plasma spatial distribution is non-uniform in the plasma chamber, with a density peak of $n_e = 5 \cdot 10^{19} m^{−3}$ in the RF coil region. In the filter field region the electron density drops by two orders of magnitude, with a substantial reduction of the electron energy as well. This results in a ratio $e/H^− \approx 1$ in the extraction region. The vibrational population is characterized by a two temperature distribution, with the high vibrational states showing a factor 2 higher termperature. A very good agreement is found between the simulation results and optical emission spectroscopy measurement performed on a dedicated test stand at CERN.",1
121539,2,"Revealing tensor monopoles through quantum-metric measurements We propose a generic protocol to experimentally measure the quantum metric tensor, a fundamental geometric property of quantum states. Our method is based on the observation that the excitation rate of a quantum state directly relates to components of the quantum metric upon applying a proper time-periodic modulation. We discuss the applicability of this scheme to generic two-level systems, where the Hamiltonian's parameters can be externally tuned, and also to the context of Bloch bands associated with lattice systems. As an illustration, we extract the quantum metric of the multiband Hofstadter model. Moreover, we demonstrate how this method can be used to directly probe the spread functional, a quantity which sets the lower bound on the spread of Wannier functions and signals phase transitions. Our proposal offers a universal probe for quantum geometry, which could be readily applied in a wide range of physical settings, ranging from superconducting quantum circuits to ultracold atomic gases.",1

121707,2,"BICEP2 / Keck Array VII: Matrix based E/B Separation applied to BICEP2 and the Keck Array A linear polarization field on the sphere can be uniquely decomposed into an E-mode and a B-mode component. These two components are analytically defined in terms of spin-2 spherical harmonics. Maps that contain filtered modes on a partial sky can also be decomposed into E-mode and B-mode components. However, the lack of full sky information prevents orthogonally separating these components using spherical harmonics. In this paper, we present a technique for decomposing an incomplete map into E and B-mode components using E and B eigenmodes of the pixel covariance in the observed map. This method is found to orthogonally define E and B in the presence of both partial sky coverage and spatial filtering. This method has been applied to the Bicep2 and the Keck Array maps and results in reducing E to B leakage from ΛCDM E-modes to a level corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r\lt 1\times {10}^{-4}$.",1
121716,2,"Environmental screening of dark matter haloes in $f(R)$ gravity In certain theories of modified gravity, solar system constraints on deviations from general relativity (GR) are satisfied by virtue of a so-called screening mechanism, which enables the theory to revert to GR in regions where the matter density is high or the gravitational potential is deep. In the case of chameleon theories, the screening has two contributions – self-screening, which is due to the mass of an object itself, and environmental screening, which is caused by the surrounding matter – which are often entangled, with the second contribution being more crucial for less massive objects. A quantitative understanding of the effect of the environment on the screening can prove critical in observational tests of such theories using systems such as the Local Group and dwarf galaxies, for which the environment may be inferred in various ways. We use the high-resolution liminality simulation of Shi et al. (2015) to test the fidelity of different definitions of environment. We find that, although the different ways to define environment in practice do not agree with one another perfectly, they can provide useful guidance, and cross checks about how well a dark matter halo is screened. In addition, the screening of subhaloes in dark matter haloes is primarily determined by the environment, with the subhalo mass playing a minor role, which means that lower-resolution simulations where subhaloes are not well resolved can still be useful for understanding the modification of gravity inside subhaloes.",1

We find a new classes of exact solutions of the charged black hole where the generalized Birkoff's theorem is assumed to be valid. It is found that the cosmological constant is negative inside the black hole. We confirm it from the geodesic equations too. The cosmological constant is found to be dependent on $R, Q$ and $a(v)$ which correspond to the areal radius, charge, of the black hole and the scale factor of the universe respectively. We note that the expansion of the universe affects the size and the mass of the black hole. An important observation is that, for an observer at infinity, both the mass and charge of black hole increase with the contraction of the universe and decrease with the expansion of the universe.",1

The total radiation naturally falls into two parts: the radiation formed at the entrance point of a particle into the crossed field (the synchrotron entrance radiation), and the radiation coming from the late-time asymptotics of a particle motion (the de-excited radiation). The synchrotron entrance radiation resembles, although does not coincide with, the ultrarelativistic limit of the synchrotron radiation: its distribution over energies and angles possesses almost the same properties. The de-excited radiation is soft, not concentrated in the plane of motion of a charged particle, and almost completely circularly polarized. The photon energy delivering the maximum to its spectral angular distribution decreases with increasing the initial energy of a charged particle, while the maximum value of this distribution remains the same at the fixed photon observation angle and entrance angle of a charged particle.

121789,2,"Composite Skyrmion bags in two-dimensional materials Skyrmions are particle-like topological excitations, studied in various condensed matter systems and models of high-energy physics (HEP). They occur as stable spin textures in certain planar magnetic materials and as configurations in chiral nematic liquid crystals, having been originally proposed as model of atomic nuclei. Since magnetic Skyrmions can be accelerated with a current, they have the potential to encode bits in low-power magnetic storage devices. Drawing on techniques from HEP, we demonstrate that magnetic and liquid crystal Skyrmions interact like orientation dependent, localised particles, explaining previously observed Skyrmion behaviour. This interaction motivates the construction of Skyrmion bags: textures of high topological degree which we realise experimentally in liquid crystals, and in magnetic materials by computer simulations. These Skyrmion bags configurations are nested multiple Skyrmions, which act like single Skyrmions in pairwise interaction, and under the influence of a current in magnetic materials.

While previous investigations concentrated on scaling functions and exponents describing equal-time correlations, we compute the additional scaling functions and dynamic exponent z characterizing the frequency dependence or dispersion from unequal-time correlations. This allows us to compare the characteristic condensation and correlation times from a finite-size scaling analysis depending on the system's volume.",1
121802,2,"Strong gravitational lensing for the photons coupled to a Weyl tensor in a Kerr black hole spacetime We present first the equation of motion for the photon coupled to a Weyl tensor in a Kerr black hole spacetime and then study further the corresponding strong gravitational lensing. We find that black hole rotation makes propagation of the coupled photons more complicated, which brings about some new features for physical quantities, including the marginally circular photon orbit, the deflection angle, the observational gravitational lensing variables, and the time delay between two relativistic images. There is a critical value of the coupling parameter for existence of the marginally circular photon orbit outside the event horizon, which depends on the rotation parameter of the black hole and the polarization direction of the photons. As the value of the coupling parameter nears the critical value, we find that the marginally circular photon orbit for the retrograde photon increases with the rotation parameter, which modifies a common feature of the marginally circular photon orbit in a rotating black hole spacetime since it always decreases monotonously with the rotation parameter in the case without Weyl coupling. Modeling the supermassive central object in our Galaxy as a Kerr black hole, we estimate the numerical values of the observables including time delays between the relativistic images in the strong gravitational lensing of the photons coupled to Weyl tensor.",1
121908,2,"All Majorana Models with Translation Symmetry are Supersymmetric We establish results similar to Kramers and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems but involving only translation symmetry and for Majorana modes. In particular, we show that all states are at least doubly degenerate in any one- and two-dimensional array of Majorana modes with translation symmetry, periodic boundary conditions, and an odd number of modes per unit cell. Moreover, we show that all such systems have an underlying N=2 supersymmetry and explicitly construct the generator of the supersymmetry. Furthermore, we establish that there cannot be a unique gapped ground state in such one-dimensional systems with antiperiodic boundary conditions. These general results are fundamentally a consequence of the fact that translations for Majorana modes are represented projectively, which in turn stems from the anomalous nature of a single Majorana mode. An experimental signature of the degeneracy arising from supersymmetry is a zero-bias peak in tunneling conductance.",1
121923,2,"Ideal MHD(-Einstein) Solutions Obeying The Force-Free Condition We find two families of analytic solutions to the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (iMHD) equations, in a class of 4-dimensional (4D) curved spacetimes. The plasma current is null, and as a result, the stress-energy tensor of the plasma itself can be chosen to take a cosmological-constant-like form. Despite the presence of a plasma, the force-free condition - where the electromagnetic current is orthogonal to the Maxwell tensor - continues to be maintained. Moreover, a special case of one of these two families leads us to a fully self-consistent solution to the Einstein-iMHD equations: we obtain the Vaidya-(anti-)de Sitter metric sourced by the plasma and a null electromagnetic stress tensor. We also provide a Mathematica code that researchers may use to readily verify analytic solutions to these iMHD equations in any curved 4D geometry.",1

122028,2,"A Gamma Class Formula for Open Gromov-Witten Calculations For toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, open Gromov-Witten invariants associated to Riemann surfaces with one boundary component can be written as the product of a disk factor and a closed invariant. Using the Brini-Cavalieri-Ross formalism, these disk factors can often be expressed in terms of gamma classes. When the Lagrangian boundary cycle is preserved by the torus action and can be locally described as the fixed locus of an anti-holomorphic involution, we prove a formula that expresses the disk factor in terms of a gamma class and combinatorial data about the image of the Lagrangian cycle in the moment polytope. We verify that this formula encodes the expected invariants obtained from localization by comparing with several examples. We then examine a novel application of this formula to disk enumeration on the quintic 3-fold. Finally, motivated by large $N$ duality, we show that this formula also unexpectedly applies to Lagrangian cycles on $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1,-1)$ constructed from torus knots.",1

By finding an appropriate constant of the motion, and transforming the equations of motion we are able to provide exact solutions in the presence of perfect fluids with anisotropic pressures. The solution space covers matter consisting of a single perfect fluid which satisfies the weak energy condition and is rich enough to contain solutions which exhibit behaviour which is qualitatively distinct from the isotropic sector. Thus we find that there is more ‘matter that matters’ close to a homogeneous singularity than the usual stiff fluid. Example metrics are given for cosmologies whose matter sources are magnetic fields, relativistic particles, cosmic strings and domain walls.",1

122127,2,"Measurement of the Dalitz Plot Distribution for $\eta \to \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$ with KLOE The mechanism of the isospin violating η→π+π−π0 decay is studied in a high precision
experiment using a Dalitz plot analysis. The process is sensitive to the difference between up
and down quark masses. The measurement provides an important input for the determination of
the light quark masses and for the theoretical description of the low energy strong interactions.
The measurement was carried out between 2004 and 2005 using the KLOE detector at the
DAΦNE e+e− collider located in Frascati, Italy. The data was collected at a center of mass energy
corresponding to the φ-meson peak (1019.5 MeV) with an integrated luminosity of 1.6 fb−1.
The source of the η-mesons is the radiative decay of the φ-meson: e+e−→φ→ηγ, resulting in the
world’s largest data sample of about 4.7·106 η→π+π−π0 decay events.
In this thesis, the KLOE Monte Carlo simulation and reconstruction programs are used to
optimize the background rejection cuts and to evaluate the signal efficiency. The background
contamination in the final data sample is below 1%. The data sample is used to construct the
Dalitz plot distribution in the normalized dimensionless variables X and Y. The distribution
is parametrized by determining the coefficients of the third order polynomial in the X and Y
variables (so called Dalitz plot parameters). The statistical accuracy of the extracted parameters
is two times better than any of the previous measurements. In particular the contribution of
the X2Y term is found to be different from zero with a significance of approximately 3σ. The
systematic effects are studied and found to be of the same size as the statistical uncertainty. The
contribution of the terms related to charge conjugation violation (odd powers of the X variable)
and the measured charge asymmetries are consistent with zero.
The background subtracted and acceptance corrected bin contents of the Dalitz plot

theoretical calculations.",1

122260,2,"Rotating neutron stars with exotic cores: masses, radii, stability A set of theoretical mass-radius relations for rigidly rotating neutron stars with exotic cores, obtained in various theories of dense matter, is reviewed. Two basic observational constraints are used: the largest measured rotation frequency (716Hz) and the maximum measured mass ( 2M$_{⊙}$ . The present status of measuring the radii of neutron stars is described. The theory of rigidly rotating stars in general relativity is reviewed and limitations of the slow rotation approximation are pointed out. Mass-radius relations for rotating neutron stars with hyperon and quark cores are illustrated using several models. Problems related to the non-uniqueness of the crust-core matching are mentioned. Limits on rigid rotation resulting from the mass-shedding instability and the instability with respect to the axisymmetric perturbations are summarized. The problem of instabilities and of the back-bending phenomenon are discussed in detail. Metastability and instability of a neutron star core in the case of a first-order phase transition, both between pure phases, and into a mixed-phase state, are reviewed.

A gradient of the inter-foil distance is introduced by using spacers with different heights at the two ends of the foil gap. While the cluster size and the intrinsic spatial resolution show insignificant dependence on the inter-foil distance, the gain exhibits an approximately linear dependence on the inter-foil distance. From the slope, a quantitative relationship between the change of the inter-foil distance and the change of the gain is derived, which can be used as a method to evaluate the non-uniformity of the foil gap in the application of large-area GEM detectors.",1
122318,2,"Testing the Equivalence Principle in space after MICROSCOPE Tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) can reveal a new composition dependent force of nature or disprove many models of new physics. For the first time this test is successfully carried out in space by the MICROSCOPE satellite. Early results show no violation sourced by the Earth for Pt and Ti test masses with random errors (after 8.26 d of integration time) of about 1e-14 and similar systematic errors. It improves by 10 times over the best ground tests with rotating torsion balances despite 70 times less sensitivity to differential accelerations, thanks to the much stronger driving signal in orbit. The test is limited by thermal noise higher than expected due to the poor quality factor of the gold wires used for electric grounding. This noise was shown to decrease when the spacecraft was set to rotate faster than planned. The result will improve by the end of the mission, as thermal noise decreases with more data. Not so systematic errors. We investigate major non-gravitational effects and find that the Pt-Pt zero-check sensor does not allow their separation from the signal. The early test itself reports systematics in the Pt-Ti sensor which are not detected in the Pt-Pt one, hence would not be distinguished from a violation. The improved test will need more measurements to check systematics, but there is not enough time left. MICROSCOPE demonstrates the huge potential of space for WEP tests of very high precision and indicates how to reach it. To realize the potential, a new experiment needs the spacecraft to be in rapid, stable rotation around the symmetry axis, needs high quality mechanical suspensions as in the most precise gravitational experiments on ground, and must allow systematic checks. The design of the `Galileo Galilei' (GG) experiment, aiming to test the WEP to 1e-17 and currently a candidate for a medium-sized mission of the ESA, unites all the needed features.",1

122418,2,"FFT-PT: Reducing the two-loop large-scale structure power spectrum to low-dimensional radial integrals Modeling the large-scale structure of the universe on nonlinear scales has the potential to substantially increase the science return of upcoming surveys by increasing the number of modes available for model comparisons. One way to achieve this is to model nonlinear scales perturbatively. Unfortunately, this involves high-dimensional loop integrals that are cumbersome to evaluate. Trying to simplify this, we show how two-loop (next-to-next-to-leading order) corrections to the density power spectrum can be reduced to low-dimensional, radial integrals. Many of those can be evaluated with a one-dimensional fast Fourier transform, which is significantly faster than the five-dimensional Monte-Carlo integrals that are needed otherwise. The general idea of this fast fourier transform perturbation theory method is to switch between Fourier and position space to avoid convolutions and integrate over orientations, leaving only radial integrals. This reformulation is independent of the underlying shape of the initial linear density power spectrum and should easily accommodate features such as those from baryonic acoustic oscillations. We also discuss how to account for halo bias and redshift space distortions.",1
122457,2,"Testing general relativity’s no-hair theorem with x-ray observations of black holes Despite its success in the weak gravity regime, general relativity (GR) has yet to be verified in the regime of strong gravity. In this paper, we present the results of detailed ray-tracing simulations aiming at clarifying if the combined information from x-ray spectroscopy, timing, and polarization observations of stellar mass and supermassive black holes can be used to test GR’s no-hair theorem. The latter states that stationary astrophysical black holes are described by the Kerr family of metrics, with the black hole mass and spin being the only free parameters. We use four “non-Kerr metrics,” some phenomenological in nature and others motivated by alternative theories of gravity, and study the observational signatures of deviations from the Kerr metric. Particular attention is given to the case when all the metrics are set to give the same innermost stable circular orbit in quasi–Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. We give a detailed discussion of similarities and differences of the observational signatures predicted for black holes in the Kerr metric and the non-Kerr metrics. We emphasize that even though some regions of the parameter space are nearly degenerate even when combining the information from all observational channels, x-ray observations of very rapidly spinning black holes can be used to exclude large regions of the parameter space of the alternative metrics. Although it proves difficult to distinguish between the Kerr and non-Kerr metrics for some portions of the parameter space, the observations of very rapidly spinning black holes like Cyg X-1 can be used to rule out large regions for several black hole metrics.",1
122552,2,"The mass and angular momentum of reconstructed metric perturbations We prove a key result regarding the mass and angular momentum content of linear vacuum perturbations of the Kerr metric obtained through the formalism developed by Chrzarnowski, Cohen, and Kegeles (CCK). More precisely, we prove that the Abbott–Deser mass and angular momentum integrals of any such perturbation vanish when that perturbation was obtained from a regular Fourier mode of the Hertz potential. As a corollary we obtain a generalization of previous results on the completion of the ‘no string’ radiation gauge metric perturbation generated by a point particle. We find that for any bound orbit around a Kerr black hole, the mass and angular momentum perturbations completing the CCK metric are simply the energy and angular momentum of the particle ‘outside’ the orbit and vanish ‘inside’ the orbit.",1

We also give the relativistic Lagrangian density describing the motion of induced magnetic dipoles in the magnetic fields which induce the dipole, and the electric fields which generate the AC topological phase, and derive the conditions for this AC phase to be topological.

The gamma beam is directed to a deuteron target and the photo-disintegration process generates a neutron beam.

122686,2,"Steering of Sub-GeV electrons by ultrashort Si and Ge bent crystals We report the observation of the steering of 855 MeV electrons by bent silicon and germanium crystals at the MAinzer MIkrotron. Crystals with 15 $\upmu $ m of length, bent along (111) planes, were exploited to investigate orientational coherent effects. By using a piezo-actuated mechanical holder, which allowed to remotely change the crystal curvature, it was possible to study the steering capability of planar channeling and volume reflection vs. the curvature radius and the atomic number, Z. For silicon, the channeling efficiency exceeds 35%, a record for negatively charged particles. This was possible due to the realization of a crystal with a thickness of the order of the dechanneling length. On the other hand, for germanium the efficiency is slightly below 10% due to the stronger contribution of multiple scattering for a higher-Z material. Nevertheless this is the first evidence of negative beam steering by planar channeling in a Ge crystal. Having determined for the first time the dechanneling length, one may design a Ge crystal based on such knowledge providing nearly the same channeling efficiency of silicon. The presented results are relevant for crystal-based beam manipulation as well as for the generation of e.m. radiation in bent and periodically bent crystals.",1

122780,2,"Electron Motion in the Three-Dimensional Field of Undulator In this paper we consider the motion of relativistic electrons in an ideal three-dimensional magnetic field of an undulator. The ideality of the magnetic field means that, on the undulator axis, the field is directed strictly vertically upward and has a strictly sinusoidal shape. In the overwhelming majority of cases, only this leading component of the field is taken into account in calculating the electron trajectory. In this paper, in the equations of motion of an electron in the magnetic field of an undulator, all three components of the field are taken into account, so that the undulator field under consideration satisfies the stationary Maxwell equations. In this case, the differential equations of motion of the electron are solved analytically with the help of perturbation theory, and not by the method of averaging over fast oscillations of the electron, as was done in a number of previous papers. These analytic expressions for trajectories describe the behavior of particles in the focusing magnetic field of an undulator much more completely. An analysis of these expressions shows that the behavior of electrons in such a three-dimensional field of the undulator is much more complicated than what follows from the equations obtained by the averaging method. In particular, there is a cross effect when changes in the initial vertical parameters of the electron trajectory cause changes in the horizontal component of its trajectory and vice versa. A comparison of the solutions obtained analytically with the results of numerical calculations of electron trajectories using the Runge–Kutta method demonstrates their high accuracy.",1
122782,2,"Conformal Frame dependence on Cosmological Observations in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity Cosmological observations provide more accurate values both for background evolution of the Universe and for the structure formation. These values are given by the so-called dark energy equation of state, $\omega$ and the growth index parameter, $\gamma$. From these observed parameters, one can reconstruct the model functions in scalar tensor gravity theories. However, there is a long standing debate about the (in)equality between conformally transformed frames in scalar tensor gravity models. We show that cosmological observables are frame dependent when they are described by frame independent parameter, redshift. Thus, if the cosmological observables are interpreted in one frame, then all of the observables should also be interpreted in that frame. This explicitly shows the conformal inequality of cosmological observables. Also, our method provides the model independent analysis for STG models about various observables in both frames.",1

122927,2,"Measurements and simulations of athermal phonon transmission from silicon absorbers to aluminium sensors Phonon reflection/transmission at the interfaces plays a fundamental role in cryogenic particle detectors, in which the optimization of the phonon signal at the sensor (in case of phonon-mediated detectors) or the minimization of the heat transmission (when the detection occurs in the sensor itself) is of primary importance to improve sensitivity. Nevertheless the mechanisms governing the phonon physics at the interfaces are still not completely understood. The two more successful models, Acoustic Mismatch Model (AMM) and Diffuse Mismatch Model (DMM) are not able to explain all the accumulated experimental data, and the measurement of the transmission coefficients between the materials remains a challenge. Here, we use measurements of the athermal phonon flux in aluminium Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID) deposited on silicon substrates following a particle interaction to validate a Monte Carlo (MC) phonon simulation. We apply the Mattis-Bardeen theory to derive the phonon pulse energy and timing from the KID signal and compare the results with the MC for both AMM and DMM models, finding a remarkable good agreement for AMM. For an aluminum film of 60 nm and a silicon substrate of 380~$\mu$m, we obtain transmission coefficients Si-Al in the range [0.3-0.55] and Si-Teflon in the range [0.1-0.15].",1

A number of phenomena in nuclear structure have been successfully interpreted directly or implicitly by this symmetry, including nuclear superdeformed configurations, identical bands, quantized alignment, pseudospin partner bands, and so on. Since the PSS was recognized as a relativistic symmetry in 1990s, there have been comprehensive efforts to understand its properties in various systems and potentials. In this review, we mainly focus on the latest progress on the supersymmetric (SUSY) representation of PSS, and one of the key targets is to understand its symmetry-breaking mechanism in realistic nuclei in a quantitative and perturbative way. The SUSY quantum mechanics and its applications to the SU(2) and U(3) symmetries of the Dirac Hamiltonian are discussed in detail. It is shown that the origin of PSS and its symmetry-breaking mechanism, which are deeply hidden in the origin Hamiltonian, can be traced by its SUSY partner Hamiltonian. Essential open questions, such as the SUSY representation of PSS in the deformed system, are pointed out.",1

122982,2,"Density split statistics: joint model of counts and lensing in cells We present density split statistics, a framework that studies lensing and counts-in-cells as a function of foreground galaxy density, thereby providing a large-scale measurement of both 2-point and 3-point statistics. Our method extends our earlier work on trough lensing and is summarized as follows: given a foreground (low redshift) population of galaxies, we divide the sky into subareas of equal size but distinct galaxy density. We then measure lensing around uniformly spaced points separately in each of these subareas, as well as counts-in-cells statistics (CiC). The lensing signals trace the matter density contrast around regions of fixed galaxy density. Through the CiC measurements this can be related to the density profile around regions of fixed matter density. Together, these measurements constitute a powerful probe of cosmology, the skewness of the density field and the connection of galaxies and matter. In this paper we show how to model both the density split lensing signal and CiC from basic ingredients: a non-linear power spectrum, clustering hierarchy coefficients from perturbation theory and a parametric model for galaxy bias and shot-noise. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that this model is sufficiently accurate for a cosmological analysis on year 1 data from the Dark Energy Survey.",1
122985,2,"The nuclear symmetry energy The nuclear symmetry energy characterizes the variation of the binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio of a nuclear system is varied. This is one of the most important features of nuclear physics in general, since it is just related to the two component nature of the nuclear systems.

In recent years, a great interest was devoted not only to the Nuclear Matter symmetry energy at saturation density but also to its whole density dependence, which is an essential ingredient for our understanding of many phenomena. We analyze the nuclear symmetry energy in different realms of nuclear physics and astrophysics. In particular we consider the nuclear symmetry energy in relation to nuclear structure, astrophysics of Neutron Stars and supernovae, and heavy ion collision experiments, trying to elucidate the connections of these different fields on the basis of the symmetry energy peculiarities.

The DM of the repeating FRB 121102 is known to <1% , a host galaxy has now been identified with high confidence, and its redshift, z , has now been determined with high accuracy: z=0.19273(8) . Taking into account the plasma contributions to the DM from the Intergalactic medium (IGM) and the Milky Way, we use the data on FRB 121102 to derive the constraint mγ≲2.2×10−14 eVc−2 ( 3.9×10−50 kg ).

123415,2,"Commissioning of the ECR ion source of the high intensity proton injector of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) The CEA at Saclay is in charge of developing and building the ion source and the low energy line of the proton linac of the FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) accelerator complex located at GSI (Darmstadt) in Germany. The FAIR facility will deliver stable and rare isotope beams covering a huge range of intensities and beam energies for experiments in the fields of atomic physics, plasma physics, nuclear physics, hadron physics, nuclear matter physics, material physics, and biophysics. A significant part of the experimental program at FAIR is dedicated to antiproton physics that requires an ultimate number 7 × 1010 cooled pbar/h. The high-intensity proton beam that is necessary for antiproton production will be delivered by a dedicated 75 mA/70 MeV proton linac. A 2.45 GHz microwave ion source will deliver a 100 mA H+ beam pulsed at 4 Hz with an energy of 95 keV. A 2 solenoids low energy beam transport line allows the injection of the proton beam into the radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) within an acceptance of 0.3π mm mrad (norm. rms). An electrostatic chopper system located between the second solenoid and the RFQ is used to cut the beam macro-pulse from the source to inject 36 μs long beam pulses into the RFQ. At present time, a Ladder-RFQ is under construction at the University of Frankfurt. This article reports the first beam measurements obtained since mid of 2016. Proton beams have been extracted from the ECR ion source and analyzed just after the extraction column on a dedicated diagnostic chamber. Emittance measurements as well as extracted current and species proportion analysis have been performed in different configurations of ion source parameters, such as magnetic field profile, radio frequency power, gas injection, and puller electrode voltage.",1
123420,2,"Generalized Orbifold Construction for Conformal Nets Let ℬ be a conformal net. We give the notion of a proper action of a finite hypergroup K acting by vacuum preserving unital completely positive (so-called stochastic) maps on ℬ which generalizes the proper action of a finite group G. Taking the fixed point under such an action gives a finite index subnet ℬK of ℬ, which generalizes the G-orbifold net. Conversely, we show that if 𝒜⊂ℬ is a finite inclusion of conformal nets, then 𝒜 is a generalized orbifold 𝒜 = ℬK of the conformal net ℬ by a unique finite hypergroup K. There is a Galois correspondence between intermediate nets ℬK ⊂𝒜⊂ℬ and subhypergroups L ⊂ K given by 𝒜 = ℬL. In this case, the fixed point of ℬK ⊂𝒜 is the generalized orbifold by the hypergroup of double cosets L∖K/L. If 𝒜⊂ℬ is a finite index inclusion of completely rational nets, we show that the inclusion 𝒜(I) ⊂ℬ(I) is conjugate to an intermediate subfactor of a Longo–Rehren inclusion. This implies that if ℬ is a holomorphic net, and K acts properly on ℬ, then there is a unitary fusion category ℱ which is a categorification of K and Rep(ℬK) is braided equivalent to the Drinfel’d center Z(ℱ). More generally, if ℬ is a completely rational conformal net and K acts properly on ℬ, then there is a unitary fusion category ℱ extending Rep(ℬ), such that K is given by the double cosets of the fusion ring of ℱ by the Verlinde fusion ring of ℬ and Rep(ℬK) is braided equivalent to the Müger centralizer of Rep(ℬ) in the Drinfel’d center Z(ℱ).",1

We have also studied the time evolution of the flux, finding a correlation with the solar activity. We have developed a full Monte Carlo simulation describing the interactions of cosmic rays with the lunar surface. The results of the present analysis can be explained in the framework of this model, where the production of gamma rays is due to the interactions of cosmic-ray proton and helium nuclei with the surface of the Moon.

123433,2,"The 1-loop self-energy of an electron in a strong external magnetic field revisited I calculate the 1-loop self-energy of the lowest Landau level of an electron of mass m in a strong, constant and uniform external magnetic field B, beyond its always used truncation at (ln L)2, L = |e|B m2. This is achieved by evaluating the integral deduced in 1953 by Demeur and incompletely calculated in 1969 by Jancovici, which I recover from Schwinger’s techniques of calculation. It yields δm ≃ αm 4π ln L − γE −3 22 −9 4 + π β−1 + π2 6 + πΓ[1−β] Lβ−1 + 1 L π 2−β − 5 + 𝒪 1 L≥2 with β ≃ 1.175 for 75 ≤ L ≤ 10, 000. The (ln L)2 truncation exceeds the precise estimate by 45% at L = 100 and by more at lower values of L, due to neglecting, among others, the single logarithmic contribution. This is doubly unjustified because it is large and because it is needed to fulfill appropriate renormalization conditions.

123617,2,"Spindynamik in Elektronensynchrotronen Providing spin polarized particle beams with circular accelerators requires the consideration of depolarizing resonances which may significantly reduce the desired degree of polarization at specific beam energies. The corresponding spin dynamical effects are typically analyzed with numerical methods. In case of electron beams the influence of the emission of synchrotron radiation has to be taken into account.
On short timescales, as in synchrotrons with a fast energy ramp or in damping rings, spin dynamics are investigated with spin tracking algorithms. This thesis presents the spin tracking code Polematrix as a versatile tool to study the impact of synchrotron radiation on spin dynamics. Spin tracking simulations have been performed based on the well established particle tracking code Elegant. The numerical studies demonstrate effects which are responsible for beam depolarization: Synchrotron side bands of depolarizing resonances and decoherence of spin precession. Polematrix can be utilized for any electron accelerator with minimal effort as it imports lattice files from the tracking programs MAD-X or Elegant. Polematrix has been published as open source software.
Currently, the Electron Stretcher Accelerator ELSA at Bonn University is the only electron synchrotron worldwide providing a polarized beam. Integer and intrinsic depolarizing resonances are compensated with dedicated countermeasures during the fast energy ramp. Polarization measurements from ELSA demonstrate the particular spin dynamics of electrons and confirm the results of the spin tracking code Polematrix.",1

A scheme is proposed to detect positron-atom bound states by colliding Rydberg positronium (Ps) with neutral atoms. Estimates of the charge-transfer reaction cross section are obtained using the first Born approximation for a selection of neutral atom targets and a wide range of incident Ps energies and principal quantum numbers. We also estimate the corresponding Ps ionization cross section. The accuracy of the calculations is tested by comparison with earlier predictions for charge transfer in Ps collisions with hydrogen and antihydrogen.

We conclude that the proposed methodology is capable of producing such states and of testing theoretical predictions of their binding energies.",1
123948,2,"Radiation Hardness of Thin Low Gain Avalanche Detectors Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD) are based on a n ++ -p + -p-p ++ structure where an appropriate doping of the multiplication layer (p + ) leads to high enough electric fields for impact ionization. Gain factors of few tens in charge significantly improve the resolution of timing measurements, particularly for thin detectors, where the timing performance was shown to be limited by Landau fluctuations. The main obstacle for their operation is the decrease of gain with irradiation, attributed to effective acceptor removal in the gain layer. Sets of thin sensors were produced by two different producers on different substrates, with different gain layer doping profiles and thicknesses (45, 50 and 80  μ m). Their performance in terms of gain/collected charge and leakage current was compared before and after irradiation with neutrons and pions up to the equivalent fluences of 5⋅1015 cm −2 . Transient Current Technique and charge collection measurements with LHC speed electronics were employed to characterize the detectors. The thin LGAD sensors were shown to perform much better than sensors of standard thickness ( ∼ 300  μ m) and offer larger charge collection with respect to detectors without gain layer for fluences <2⋅1015  cm −2 . Larger initial gain prolongs the beneficial performance of LGADs. Pions were found to be more damaging than neutrons at the same equivalent fluence, while no significant difference was found between different producers. At very high fluences and bias voltages the gain appears due to deep acceptors in the bulk, hence also in thin standard detectors.",1

124024,2,"Exploring cosmic origins with CORE: Survey requirements and mission design Future observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation have the potential to answer some of the most fundamental questions of modern physics and cosmology, including: what physical process gave birth to the Universe we see today? What are the dark matter and dark energy that seem to constitute 95% of the energy density of the Universe? Do we need extensions to the standard model of particle physics and fundamental interactions? Is the ΛCDM cosmological scenario correct, or are we missing an essential piece of the puzzle? In this paper, we list the requirements for a future CMB polarisation survey addressing these scientific objectives, and discuss the design drivers of the COREmfive space mission proposed to ESA in answer to the ""M5"" call for a medium-sized mission. The rationale and options, and the methodologies used to assess the mission's performance, are of interest to other future CMB mission design studies. COREmfive has 19 frequency channels, distributed over a broad frequency range, spanning the 60–600 GHz interval, to control astrophysical foreground emission. The angular resolution ranges from 2' to 18', and the aggregate CMB sensitivity is about 2 μK⋅arcmin. The observations are made with a single integrated focal-plane instrument, consisting of an array of 2100 cryogenically-cooled, linearly-polarised detectors at the focus of a 1.2-m aperture cross-Dragone telescope. The mission is designed to minimise all sources of systematic effects, which must be controlled so that no more than 10−4 of the intensity leaks into polarisation maps, and no more than about 1% of E-type polarisation leaks into B-type modes. COREmfive observes the sky from a large Lissajous orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point on an orbit that offers stable observing conditions and avoids contamination from sidelobe pick-up of stray radiation originating from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. The entire sky is observed repeatedly during four years of continuous scanning, with a combination of three rotations of the spacecraft over different timescales. With about 50% of the sky covered every few days, this scan strategy provides the mitigation of systematic effects and the internal redundancy that are needed to convincingly extract the primordial B-mode signal on large angular scales, and check with adequate sensitivity the consistency of the observations in several independent data subsets. COREmfive is designed as a ""near-ultimate"" CMB polarisation mission which, for optimal complementarity with ground-based observations, will perform the observations that are known to be essential to CMB polarisation science and cannot be obtained by any other means than a dedicated space mission. It will provide well-characterised, highly-redundant multi-frequency observations of polarisation at all the scales where foreground emission and cosmic variance dominate the final uncertainty for obtaining precision CMB science, as well as 2' angular resolution maps of high-frequency foreground emission in the 300–600 GHz frequency range, essential for complementarity with future ground-based observations with large telescopes that can observe the CMB with the same beamsize.",1

For the quality assurance of prototype micro-strip detectors a non-invasive detector charaterization is developed. The test system is using a pulsed infrared laser for charge injection and characterization, called Laser Test System (LTS). The system is aimed to develop a set of characterization procedures which are non-invasive (non-destructive) in nature and could be used for quality assurances of several silicon micro-strip detectors in an efficient, reliable and reproducible way. The procedures developed (as reported here) uses the LTS to scan sensors with a pulsed infra-red laser driven by step motor to determine the charge sharing in-between strips and to measure qualitative uniformity of the sensor response over the whole active area. The prototype detector modules which are tested with the LTS so far have 1024 strips with a pitch of 58 μm on each side. They are read-out using a self-triggering prototype read-out electronic ASIC called n-XYTER. The LTS is designed to measure sensor response in an automatized procedure at several thousand positions across the sensor with focused infra-red laser light (spot size ≈ 12 μm, wavelength = 1060 nm). The pulse with a duration of ≈ 10 ns and power ≈ 5 mW of the laser pulse is selected such, that the absorption of the laser light in the 300 μm thick silicon sensor produces ≈ 24000 electrons, which is similar to the charge created by minimum ionizing particles (MIP) in these sensors.

124360,2,"Majorana fermions in three dimensions and realization in critical Weyl semimetals We present two band models for free fermion with charge conjugation symmetry in three dimensions. Without time reversal symmetry (TRS), the weak pairing gapless $A$-phase is a Majorana fermion $p_x+ip_y$ wave FFLO state while the strong pairing gapped $B$-phase belongs to topologically trivial Class $D$. With TRS, there is a Majorana fermion $B$-phase belonging to Class $DIII$ with a non-zero Hopf invariant. The TRS $A$-phase is also a Majorana fermion FFLO state with TRS. The surface states of the TRS $B$-phase are either a valley-momentum locked Majorana-Dirac cone or a linear-quadratic mixed cone for a specific surface. The surface states of the $A$-phase on one surface are topologically nontrivial, either having $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant depending on whether the system is TRS or not. The edge states of that surface are gapless Majorana modes. The Majorana fermion gapless FFLO states can be realized in critical Weyl semimetals (WSM) in which dual single Weyl nodes form dipoles and are nearly annihilated. The gapped $B$-phase emerges when Weyl node dipoles are about to be created.

124378,2,"Eta-mesic nuclei In this contribution we report on theoretical studies of $\eta$ nuclear quasi-bound states in few- and many-body systems performed recently by the Jerusalem-Prague Collaboration [1-5]. Underlying energy-dependent $\eta N$ interactions are derived from coupled-channel models that incorporate the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. The role of self-consistent treatment of the strong energy dependence of subthreshold $\eta N$ amplitudes is discussed. Quite large downward energy shift together with rapid decrease of the $\eta N$ amplitudes below threshold result in relatively small binding energies and widths of the calculated $\eta$ nuclear bound states. We argue that the subthreshold behavior of $\eta N$ scattering amplitudes is crucial to conclude whether $\eta$ nuclear states exist, in which nuclei the $\eta$ meson could be bound and if the corresponding widths are small enough to allow detection of these $\eta$ nuclear states in experiment.",1

Therefore, a wide range of EOSs spanning the allowed range of nuclear interactions are necessary for determining the sensitivity of these astrophysical phenomena and their signatures to variations in input microphysics. We present a new set of finite temperature EOSs based on experimentally allowed Skyrme forces. We employ a liquid-drop model of nuclei to capture the nonuniform phase of nuclear matter at subsaturation density, which is blended into a nuclear statistical equilibrium EOS at lower densities. We also provide a new, open-source code for calculating EOSs for arbitrary Skyrme parametrizations.

The approach we propose is similar to the one by Fortson (Phys Rev Lett 70:2383, 10) to measure the PNC-induced light shift which arises from the interference of parity nonconserving electric dipole transition and electric quadrupole transition amplitudes. Its major advantage is that it can treat more than $10^4$ ultracold ${^{210}\mathrm{Fr}}$ atoms to enhance the shot noise limit. A relativistic coupled-cluster method has been employed to calculate the electric dipole transition amplitudes arising from the PNC interaction. Based on these calculations, we have evaluated the PNC-induced light shifts for transitions between the hyperfine levels of the $7S_{1/2}$ and $6D_{3/2}$ states and suitable transitions are identified for carrying out PNC measurements.

124553,2,"Topology of a$^{3}$He-A Film on a Corrugated Graphene Substrate A thin film of superfluid$^{3}$He on a corrugated graphene substrate represents topological matter with a smooth disorder. It is possible that the atomically smooth disorder produced by the corrugated graphene does not destroy the superfluidity even in a very thin film, where the system can be considered as quasi two-dimensional topological material. This will allow us to study the effect of disorder on different classes of the 2 + 1 topological materials: the chiral$^{3}$He-A with intrinsic quantum Hall effect and the time reversal invariant planar phase with intrinsic spin quantum Hall effect. In the limit of smooth disorder, the system can be considered as a Chern mosaic, i.e., a collection of domains with different values of Chern numbers. In this limit, the quantization of the Hall conductance is determined by the percolated domain, while the density of the fermionic states is determined by the edge modes on the boundaries of the finite domains. This system can be useful for the general consideration of disorder in the topological matter.",1
124572,2,"Entangled Cloning of Stabilizer Codes and Free Fermions Though the no-cloning theorem [Wooters and Zurek, Nature (London) 299, 802 (1982)10.1038/299802a0] prohibits exact replication of arbitrary quantum states, there are many instances in quantum information processing and entanglement measurement in which a weaker form of cloning may be useful. Here, I provide a construction for generating an “entangled clone” for a particular but rather expansive and rich class of states. Given a stabilizer code or free fermion Hamiltonian, this construction generates an exact entangled clone of the original ground state, in the sense that the entanglement between the original and the exact copy can be tuned to be arbitrarily small but finite, or large, and the relation between the original and the copy can also be modified to some extent. For example, this Rapid Communication focuses on generating time-reversed copies of stabilizer codes and particle-hole transformed ground states of free fermion systems, although untransformed clones can also be generated. The protocol leverages entanglement to simulate a transformed copy of the Hamiltonian without having to physically implement it and can potentially be realized in superconducting qubits or ultracold atomic systems.",1

In addition, we obtain the 2PN spin contributions to the amplitude of the frequency-domain gravitational waveforms for nonprecessing binaries, using recently derived expressions for the time-domain polarization amplitudes of binaries with generic spins, complete at that accuracy level. These two results are updates to [K. G. Arun, A. Buonanno, G. Faye, and E. Ochsner, Phys. Rev. D 79, 104023 (2009).] for amplitude and [M. Wade, J. D. E. Creighton, E. Ochsner, and A. B.

Very recently, the cosmological origin of FRB 150418 has been confirmed by Keane et al., and FRBs are now strong competitors as cosmological probes. The simple sharp feature of the FRB signal is ideal to probe some of the fundamental laws of physics. Here we show that by analyzing the delay time between different frequencies, the FRB data can place stringent upper limits on the rest mass of the photon. For FRB 150418 at z = 0.492, one can potentially reach ${m}_{\gamma }\leqslant 5.2\times {10}^{-47}$ g, which is 10(20) times smaller than the rest mass of electron and is about 10(3) times smaller than that obtained using other astrophysical sources with the same method.",1

124901,2,"$\mathbf{Z}_{n}$ clock models and chains of $so(n)_2$ non-Abelian anyons: symmetries, integrable points and low energy properties We study two families of quantum models which have been used previously to investigate the effect of topological symmetries in one-dimensional correlated matter. Various striking similarities are observed between certain quantum clock models, spin chains generalizing the Ising model, and chains of non-Abelian anyons constructed from the so(n)2 fusion category for odd n, both subject to periodic boundary conditions. In spite of the differences between these two types of quantum chains, e.g. their Hilbert spaces being spanned by tensor products of local spin states or fusion paths of anyons, the symmetries of the lattice models are shown to be closely related. Furthermore, under a suitable mapping between the parameters describing the interaction between spins and anyons the respective Hamiltonians share part of their energy spectrum (although their degeneracies may differ). This spin-anyon correspondence can be extended by fine-tuning of the coupling constants leading to exactly solvable models. We show that the algebraic structures underlying the integrability of the clock models and the anyon chain are the same. For n  =  3,5,7 we perform an extensive finite size study—both numerical and based on the exact solution—of these models to map out their ground state phase diagram and to identify the effective field theories describing their low energy behaviour. We observe that the continuum limit at the integrable points can be described by rational conformal field theories with extended symmetry algebras which can be related to the discrete ones of the lattice models.",1

An accurate simulation is necessary to correctly design and compare these detectors. We establish baseline distributions of key kinematic variables as simulated by a 5D, exact down to threshold, and polarised event generator. We compare them to simulations with the low energy electromagnetic models available in Geant4 and in EGS5.

125530,2,"The E$_{8}$ Geometry from a Clifford Perspective This paper considers the geometry of E$_{8}$ from a Clifford point of view in three complementary ways. Firstly, in earlier work, I had shown how to construct the four-dimensional exceptional root systems from the 3D root systems using Clifford techniques, by constructing them in the 4D even subalgebra of the 3D Clifford algebra, for instance the icosahedral root system H$_{3}$ gives rise to the largest (and therefore exceptional) non-crystallographic root system H$_{4}$. Arnold’s trinities and the McKay correspondence then hint that there might be an indirect connection between the icosahedron and E$_{8}$. Secondly, in a related construction, I have now made this connection explicit for the first time: in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D space the 120 elements of the icosahedral group H$_{3}$ are doubly covered by 240 8-component objects, which endowed with a ‘reduced inner product’ are exactly the E$_{8}$ root system. It was previously known that E$_{8}$ splits into H$_{4}$-invariant subspaces, and we discuss the folding construction relating the two pictures. This folding is a partial version of the one used for the construction of the Coxeter plane, so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the Coxeter plane in a Clifford algebra framework. We advocate the complete factorisation of the Coxeter versor in the Clifford algebra into exponentials of bivectors describing rotations in orthogonal planes with the rotation angle giving the correct exponents, which gives much more geometric insight than the usual approach of complexification and search for complex eigenvalues. In particular, we explicitly find these factorisations for the 2D, 3D and 4D root systems, D$_{6}$ as well as E$_{8}$, whose Coxeter versor factorises as ${W = \exp(\frac{\pi}{30}B_C)\exp(\frac{11\pi}{30}B_2)\exp(\frac{7\pi}{30}B_3)\exp(\frac{13\pi}{30}B_4)}$ .

We then recast the Einstein field equations in terms of evolution and propagation of these scalars. It is then shown that this class of spacetimes must possess self-similarity and we use this property to solve for these scalars, thus obtaining a general solution. This solution has a number of very interesting cosmological or astrophysical consequences which we discuss in detail.",1
125615,2,"Many-body topological invariants in fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases We propose the definitions of many-body topological invariants to detect symmetry-protected topological phases protected by point group symmetry, using partial point group transformations on a given short-range entangled quantum ground state. Here, partial point group transformations gD are defined by point group transformations restricted to a spatial subregion D, which is closed under the point group transformations and sufficiently larger than the bulk correlation length ξ. By analytical and numerical calculations, we find that the ground state (GS) expectation value of the partial point group transformations behaves generically as 〈GS|gD|GS〉∼exp[iθ+γ−αArea(∂D)ξd−1]. Here, Area(∂D) is the area of the boundary of the subregion D, and α is a dimensionless constant. The complex phase of the expectation value θ is quantized and serves as the topological invariant, and γ is a scale-independent topological contribution to the amplitude. The examples we consider include the Z8 and Z16 invariants of topological superconductors protected by inversion symmetry in (1+1) and (3+1) dimensions, respectively, and the lens space topological invariants in (2+1)-dimensional fermionic topological phases. Connections to topological quantum field theories and cobordism classification of symmetry-protected topological phases are discussed.",1
125720,2,"Stripe melting and a transition between weak and strong symmetry protected topological phases For a gapped disordered many-body system with both internal and translation symmetry, one can define the corresponding weak and strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases. A strong SPT phase is protected by the internal symmetry G only while a weak SPT phase, fabricated by alignment of a strong SPT state in a lower dimension, requires additional discrete translation symmetry protection. In this paper, we construct a phase transition between weak and strong SPT phase in a strongly interacting boson system. The starting point of our construction is the superconducting Dirac fermions with pair density wave (PDW) order in 2d. We first demonstrate that the nodal line of the PDW contains a 1d boson SPT phase. We further show that melting the PDW stripe and condensing the nodal line provoke the transition from weak to strong SPT phase in 2d. The phase transition theory contains an O(4) nonlinear-σ model(NLσM) with topological Θ term emerging from the proliferation of domain walls bound to an SPT chain. A similar scheme also applies to weak-strong SPT transition in other dimensions and predicts possible phase transition from 2d to 3d topological order.",1
125750,2,"Warm Dark Matter Galaxies with Central Supermassive Black-Holes We generalize the Thomas-Fermi approach to galaxy structure to include self-consistently and non-linearly central supermassive black holes. This approach naturally incorporates the quantum pressure of the warm dark matter (WDM) particles and shows its full powerful and clearness in the presence of supermassive black holes (SPMHs). We find the main galaxy and central black hole magnitudes: halo radius r_h , halo mass M_h, black hole mass M_BH, velocity dispersion, phase space density, with their realistic astrophysical values, masses and sizes over a wide galaxy range. The SMBH masses arise naturally in this framework. Our extensive numerical calculations and detailed analytic resolution show that with SMBH's, both WDM regimes: classical (Boltzmann dilute) and quantum (compact) do necessarily co-exist in any galaxy: from the smaller and compact galaxies to the largest ones. The transition from the quantum to the classical region occurs precisely at the same point r_A where the chemical potential vanishes. A novel halo structure with three regions shows up: A small quantum compact core of radius r_A around the SMBH, followed by a less compact region till the BH influence radius r_i, and then for r> r_i the known halo galaxy shows up with its astrophysical size. Three representative families of galaxy plus central SMBH solutions are found and analyzed:small, medium and large galaxies having SMBH masses of 10^5, 10^7 and 10^9 M_sun respectively. A minimum galaxy size and mass ~ 10^7 M_sun larger than the one without SMBH is found. Small galaxies in the range 10^4 M_sun < M_h < 10^7 M_sun cannot harbor central SMBHs. We find novel scaling M_BH - r_h - M_h relations. The galaxy equation of state is derived: The pressure P(r) takes huge values in the SMBH vecinity and then sharply decreases entering the classical region following a local perfect gas behaviour.(Abridged)",1
125783,2,"Interacting dark energy models in Cosmology and large-scale structure observational tests Modern Cosmology offers us a great understanding of the universe with striking precision, made possible by the modern technologies of the newest generations of telescopes. The standard cosmological model, however, is not absent of theoretical problems and open questions. One possibility that has been put forward is the existence of a coupling between dark sectors. The idea of an interaction between the dark components could help physicists understand why we live in an epoch of the universe where dark matter and dark energy are comparable in terms of energy density, which can be regarded as a coincidence given that their time evolutions are completely different. We introduce the interaction phenomenologically and proceed to test models of interaction with observations of redshift-space distortions. In a flat universe composed only of those two fluids, we consider separately two forms of interaction, through terms proportional to the densities of both dark energy and dark matter. An analytic expression for the growth rate approximated as $f = \Omega_{\mathrm{DM}}^{\gamma}$, where $\Omega_{\mathrm{DM}}$ is the percentage contribution from the dark matter to the content of the universe and $\gamma$ is the growth index, is derived in terms of the interaction strength and of other parameters of the model in the first case, while for the second model we show that a non-zero interaction cannot be accommodated by the index growth approximation. The successful expressions obtained are then used to compare the predictions with growth of structure observational data in a MCMC code. We also employ observations of galaxy clusters to assess their virial state via the modified Layzer-Irvine equation in order to detect signs of an interaction, obtaining measurements of observed virial ratios, interaction strength, rest virial ratio and departure from equilibrium for a set of clusters.

125950,2,"Free Will in the Theory of Everything From what is known today about the elementary particles of matter, and the forces that control their behavior, it may be observed that still a host of obstacles must be overcome that are standing in the way of further progress of our understanding. Most researchers conclude that drastically new concepts must be investigated, new starting points are needed, older structures and theories, in spite of their successes, will have to be overthrown, and new, superintelligent questions will have to be asked and investigated. In short, they say that we shall need new physics. Here, we argue in a different manner. Today, no prototype, or toy model, of any so-called Theory of Everything exists, because the demands required of such a theory appear to be conflicting. The demands that we propose include locality, special and general relativity, together with a fundamental finiteness not only of the forces and amplitudes, but also of the set of Nature's dynamical variables. We claim that the two remaining ingredients that we have today, Quantum Field Theory and General Relativity, indeed are coming a long way towards satisfying such elementary requirements. Putting everything together in a Grand Synthesis is like solving a gigantic puzzle. We argue that we need the correct analytical tools to solve this puzzle. Finally, it seems to be obvious that this solution will give room neither for ""Divine Intervention"", nor for ""Free Will"", an observation that, all by itself, can be used as a clue.

On the one hand, the $\mathbb {Z}_2$ invariant can be formulated in terms of the Berry connection and the Berry curvature of the Bloch bundle of occupied states over the Brillouin torus. On the other, using techniques from the theory of bundle gerbes, it is possible to provide an expression for $\mathrm {FKM}$ containing the square root of the Wess–Zumino amplitude for a certain U(N)-valued field over the Brillouin torus. We link the two formulas by showing directly the equality between the above-mentioned Wess–Zumino amplitude and the Berry phase, as well as between their square roots.

In this paper we present the latest precision improvements in the high precision TDC (8 ps RMS) developed before [1], as well as the novel way of measuring ToT using a single TDC channel, while still achieving high precision (as low as 11.7 ps RMS). The effect of voltage, generated by a DC-DC converter, over the precision is also discussed. Finally, the outcome of the temperature change over the pulse width measurement is shown and a correction method is suggested to limit the degradation.",1
126996,2,"Minute-Timescale >100 MeV gamma-ray variability during the giant outburst of quasar 3C 279 observed by Fermi-LAT in 2015 June On 2015 June 16, Fermi-LAT observed a giant outburst from the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 with a peak >100 MeV flux of ∼3.6 × 10(−)(5) photons cm(−)(2) s(−)(1), averaged over orbital period intervals. It is historically the highest γ-ray flux observed from the source, including past EGRET observations, with the γ-ray isotropic luminosity reaching ∼10(49) erg s(−)(1). During the outburst, the Fermi spacecraft, which has an orbital period of 95.4 minutes, was operated in a special pointing mode to optimize the exposure for 3C 279. For the first time, significant flux variability at sub-orbital timescales was found in blazar observations by Fermi-LAT. The source flux variability was resolved down to 2-minute binned timescales, with flux doubling times of less than 5 minutes. The observed minute-scale variability suggests a very compact emission region at hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the central engine in conical jet models. A minimum bulk jet Lorentz factor (Γ) of 35 is necessary to avoid both internal γ-ray absorption and super-Eddington jet power. In the standard external radiation Comptonization scenario, Γ should be at least 50 to avoid overproducing the synchrotron self-Compton component. However, this predicts extremely low magnetization (∼5 × 10(−)(4)). Equipartition requires Γ as high as 120, unless the emitting region is a small fraction of the dissipation region. Alternatively, we consider γ rays originating as synchrotron radiation of γ (e) ∼ 1.6 × 10(6) electrons, in a magnetic field B ∼ 1.3 kG, accelerated by strong electric fields E ∼ B in the process of magnetoluminescence. At such short distance scales, one cannot immediately exclude the production of γ-rays in hadronic processes.",1
127007,2,"Isotope shift, nonlinearity of King plots, and the search for new particles We derive a mean-field relativistic formula for the isotope shift of an electronic energy level for arbitrary angular momentum; we then use it to predict the spectra of superheavy metastable neutron-rich isotopes belonging to the hypothetical island of stability. Our results may be applied to the search for superheavy atoms in astrophysical spectra using the known values of the transition frequencies for the neutron-deficient isotopes produced in the laboratory. An example of a relevant astrophysical system may be the spectra of the Przybylski's star where superheavy elements up to Z=99 have been possibly identified. In addition, it has been recently suggested to use the measurements of King plot nonlinearity in a search for hypothetical new light bosons. On the other hand, one can find the nonlinear corrections to the King plot arising already in the standard model framework. We investigate contributions to the nonlinearity arising from relativistic effects in the isotope field shift, the nuclear polarizability, and many-body effects. It is found that the nuclear polarizability contribution can lead to the significant deviation of the King plot from linearity. Therefore, the measurements of the nonlinearity of King plots may be applied to obtain the nuclear polarizability change between individual isotopes. We then proceed with providing a rough analytical estimate of the nonlinearity arising solely from the effect of a hypothetical scalar boson. Our predictions give theoretical limitations on the sensitivity of the search for new interactions and should help to identify the most suitable atoms for corresponding experiments.",1
127019,2,"Diophantine equations, Platonic solids, McKay correspondence, equivelar maps and Vogel’s universality We notice that one of the Diophantine equations, knm=2kn+2km+2nm , arising in the universality originated Diophantine classification of simple Lie algebras, has interesting interpretations for two different sets of signs of variables. In both cases it describes “regular polyhedra” with k edges in each vertex, n edges of each face, with total number of edges |m| , and Euler characteristics χ=±2 . In the case of negative m this equation corresponds to χ=2 and describes true regular polyhedra, Platonic solids. The case with positive m corresponds to Euler characteristic χ=−2 and describes the so called equivelar maps (charts) on the surface of genus 2 . In the former case there are two routes from Platonic solids to simple Lie algebras—abovementioned Diophantine classification and McKay correspondence. We compare them for all solutions of this type, and find coincidence in the case of icosahedron (dodecahedron), corresponding to E8 algebra. In the case of positive k , n and m we obtain in this way the interpretation of (some of) the mysterious solutions ( Y -objects), appearing in the Diophantine classification and having some similarities with simple Lie algebras.",1

These schemes give hierarchical quantum circuits that build up the states from unentangled degrees of freedom. The circuits are based on pairs of discrete wavelet transforms, which are approximately related by a “half-shift”: translation by half a unit cell. The presence of the Fermi surface in the two-dimensional model requires a special kind of circuit architecture to properly capture the entanglement in the ground state. We show how the error in the approximation can be controlled without ever performing a variational optimization.",1
127140,2,"Multiple harmonic frequencies resonant cavity design and half-scale prototype measurements for a fast kicker Quarter wavelength resonator (QWR) based deflecting cavities with the capability of supporting multiple odd-harmonic modes have been developed for an ultrafast periodic kicker system in the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC, formerly MEIC). Previous work on the kicking pulse synthesis and the transverse beam dynamics tracking simulations show that a flat-top kicking pulse can be generated with minimal emittance growth during injection and circulation of the cooling electron bunches. This flat-top kicking pulse can be obtained when a DC component and 10 harmonic modes with appropriate amplitude and phase are combined together. To support 10 such harmonic modes, four QWR cavities are used with 5, 3, 1, and 1 modes, respectively. In the multiple-mode cavities, several slightly tapered segments of the inner conductor are introduced to tune the higher order deflecting modes to be harmonic, and stub tuners are used to fine tune each frequency to compensate for potential errors. In this paper, we summarize the electromagnetic design of the five-mode cavity, including the geometry optimization to get high transverse shunt impedance, the frequency tuning and sensitivity analysis, and the single loop coupler design for coupling to all of the harmonic modes. In particular we report on the design and fabrication of a half-scale copper prototype of this proof-of-principle five-odd-mode cavity, as well as the rf bench measurements. Finally, we demonstrate mode superposition in this cavity experimentally, which illustrates the kicking pulse generation concept.",1

We propose two quantities, which we call anomaly indicators, that can detect if a time-reversal symmetric topological order is anomalous in this sense. Both anomaly indicators are expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions, topological spins, and time-reversal properties of the anyons in the given topological order. The first indicator, η2, applies to bosonic systems while the second indicator, ηf, applies to fermionic systems in the DIII class. We conjecture that η2, together with a previously known indicator η1, can detect the two known Z2 anomalies in the bosonic case, while ηf can detect the Z16 anomaly in the fermionic case.",1
127270,2,Green's Function of a General PT-Symmetric Non-Hermitian Non-central Potential We study the path integral solution of a system of particle moving in certain class of PT symmetric non-Hermitian and non-central potential. The Hamil- tonian of the system is converted to a separable Hamiltonian of Liouville type in parabolic coordinates and is further mapped into a Hamiltonian corresponding to two 2-dimensional simple harmonic oscillators (SHOs). Thus the explicit Green's functions for a general non-central PT symmetric non hermitian potential are cal- culated in terms of that of 2d SHOs. The entire spectrum for this three dimensional system is shown to be always real leading to the fact that the system remains in unbroken PT phase all the time.,1

Unlike the customary local point transformatyion usually utilized in GR, these transformations map in each other intrinsically different curved space-times. In this paper the problem is posed of determining the tensor transformation laws holding for the $4-$% acceleration with respect to the group of general NLPT. Basic physical implications are considered. These concern in particular the identification of NLPT-acceleration effects, namely the relationship established via general NLPT between the $4-$accelerations existing in different curved-space times. As a further application the tensor character of the EM Faraday tensor.with respect to the NLPT-group is established.",1
127449,2,"Fully pseudospectral solution of the conformally invariant wave equation near the cylinder at spacelike infinity. II: Schwarzschild background It has recently been demonstrated (Frauendiener and Hennig 2014 Class. Quantum Grav. 31 085010) that the conformally invariant wave equation on a Minkowski background can be solved with a fully pseudospectral numerical method. In particular, it is possible to include spacelike infinity into the numerical domain, which is appropriately represented as a cylinder, and highly accurate numerical solutions can be obtained with a moderate number of gridpoints. In this paper, we generalise these considerations to the spherically-symmetric wave equation on a Schwarzschild background. In the Minkowski case, a logarithmic singularity at the future boundary is present at leading order, which can easily be removed to obtain completely regular solutions. An important new feature of the Schwarzschild background is that the corresponding solutions develop logarithmic singularities at infinitely many orders. This behaviour seems to be characteristic for massive space-times. In this sense this work is indicative of properties of the solutions of the Einstein equations near spatial infinity. The use of fully pseudospectral methods allows us to still obtain very accurate numerical solutions, and the convergence properties of the spectral approximations reveal details about the singular nature of the solutions on spacelike and null infinity. These results seem to be impossible to achieve with other current numerical methods. Moreover, we describe how to impose conditions on the asymptotic behaviour of initial data so that the leading-order logarithmic terms are avoided, which further improves the numerical accuracy.",1

This gravastar is described by the three different regions, viz., (I) Interior core region, (II) Intermediate thin shell, and (III) Exterior spherical region. The pressure within the interior region is equal to the constant negative matter density which provides a repulsive force over the thin spherical shell. This thin shell is assumed to be formed by a fluid of ultrarelativistic plasma and the pressure, which is directly proportional to the matter-energy density according to Zel’dovich’s conjecture of stiff fluid [Y. B.

127710,2,"Study of the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking Sector for the LHC In this dissertation, a strongly interacting Electroweak Symmetry
Breaking Sector is considered. We use the framework of Effective Field Theories (EFT)
and unitarization procedures, successfully deployed to study resonances in low energy
QCD in the last decades. The EFT amplitudes are computed at the Next to Leading
order (NLO).
If new resonances were discovered at the LHC run-II, different theoretical approaches
could be used to study them. However, the framework that we follow here has several
advantages. For instance, it only contains a few parameters. Seven in the case of scattering
within the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking Sector (W±
L
, ZL and h); a few more if
the γγ and tt¯ states are included. And, even more important, the masses and widths of
the resonances emerge as a consequence of the low-energy behaviour of the theory. They
are not free parameters of the model, we will derive them from the Lagrangian.
The EFTs for longitudinal gauge bosons plus Higgs are being actively investigated,
because of their direct application to the experimental program of the LHC run-II. However,
they are frequently considered only as a useful parameterization of slight deviations
from the Standard Model behaviour. In other cases, they are extended to implement
new resonances in an explicit way. Our approach shares with these models the use of an
EFT in the very first steps, as well as the experimental bounds over the parameters of
the Effective Lagrangian.
If we used only the EFT, the perturbative expansion would break down because it is
derivative. But in our work below, the EFT is efficiently extended to cover the regime
of saturation of unitarity. This is achieved by dispersion relations, whose subtraction
constants and left cut contribution can be approximately obtained in different ways giving
rise to different unitarization procedures.
Several unitarization procedures have been considered. We have studied three of them
in finer detail, since they have the best properties. These chosen methods are the Inverse
Amplitude Method, one version of the N/D method and another improved version of the
K-matrix. An extended version of the first two is used for the coupling with γγ and tt¯. In
all the cases we get partial waves which are unitary, analytical with the proper left and
right cuts and in some cases poles in the second Riemann sheet that can be understood
as dynamically generated resonances. A new numerical method has been developed in
order to look for such poles.
We also point out that the unitarization formalisms are also extendable to coupled
channels. This is a novelty, and implies the possibility that an hypothetical resonance
comes from a strongly process like V V → hh → V V (V stands for a longitudinal gauge
boson). Such a resonance would be triggered by the coupling V V hh (parameter b of the
EFT), which is less constrained that the coupling V V h (parameter a).
Finally, all this work is given in a form that it could be implemented in a Monte Carlo
(MC) simulation program, in order to generate MC events for the LHC Run-II or future collider experiments.",1

We analyze how the ergoregion is affected by the parameter g to show that the area of the ergoregion increases with increasing values of g. Further, for each g, there exists a critical $a_E$ , which corresponds to a regular extremal black hole with degenerate horizons $r=r^E_H$ . $a_E$ decreases whereas $r^E_H$ increases with an increase in the parameter g. Banãdos, Silk, and West (BSW) demonstrated that the extremal Kerr black hole can act as a particle accelerator with arbitrarily high center-of-mass energy ( $E_{\mathrm{CM}}$ ) when the collision of two particles takes place near the horizon. We study the BSW process for two particles with different rest masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$ , moving in the equatorial plane of the extremal Hayward’s black hole for different values of g, to show that $E_{\mathrm{CM}}$ is arbitrarily high when one of the particles takes a critical value of the angular momentum.

We study the consequences of weakly broken particle-hole symmetry for magnetoresistance oscillations about half filling in the presence of an applied periodic one-dimensional electrostatic potential using the Dirac composite fermion theory proposed by Son [Son, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031027 (2015)2160-330810.1103/PhysRevX.5.031027]. At fixed electron density, the oscillation minima are asymmetrically biased towards higher magnetic fields, while at fixed magnetic field the oscillations occur symmetrically as the electron density is varied about half filling. We find an approximate “sum rule” obeyed for all pairs of oscillation minima that can be tested in experiment. The locations of the magnetoresistance oscillation minima for the composite fermion theory of Halperin, Lee, and Read (HLR) and its particle-hole conjugate agree exactly. Within the current experimental resolution, the locations of the oscillation minima produced by the Dirac composite fermion coincide with those of HLR.

127994,2,"Analytic heating rate of neutron star merger ejecta derived from Fermi's theory of beta decay Macronovae (kilonovae) that arise in binary neutron star mergers are powered by radioactive beta decay of hundreds of r-process nuclides.

The overall magnitude of the heating rate is determined by the mean values of nuclear quantities, e.g. the nuclear matrix elements of beta decay. These values are specified by using nuclear experimental data. We discuss the role of higher order beta transitions and the robustness of the power law. The robust and simple form of the heating rate suggests that observations of the late-time bolometric light curve ∝ t^−4/3 would be direct evidence of a r-process driven macronova. Such observations could also enable us to estimate the total amount of r-process nuclei produced in the merger.",1

This paper explores the possibility of using a single portable muon detector in conjunction with image reconstruction methods used in nuclear medicine to reconstruct a 3D image of the interior of critical infrastructure such as the Zero Energy Deuterium (ZED-2) research reactor at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories' Chalk River site. The ZED-2 reactor core and muon detector arrangement are modeled in GEANT4 and Monte Carlo measurements of the resultant muon throughput and angular distribution at several angles of rotation around the reactor are generated. Statistical analysis is then performed on these measurements based on the well-defined flux and angular distribution of muons expected near the surface of the earth. The results of this analysis are shown to produce reconstructed images of the spatial distribution of nuclear fuel within the core for multiple fuel configurations.

128314,2,"Quantum formalism for classical statistics In static classical statistical systems the problem of information transport from a boundary to the bulk finds a simple description in terms of wave functions or density matrices. While the transfer matrix formalism is a type of Heisenberg picture for this problem, we develop here the associated Schrödinger picture that keeps track of the local probabilistic information. The transport of the probabilistic information between neighboring hypersurfaces obeys a linear evolution equation, and therefore the superposition principle for the possible solutions. Operators are associated to local observables, with rules for the computation of expectation values similar to quantum mechanics. We discuss how non-commutativity naturally arises in this setting. Also other features characteristic of quantum mechanics, such as complex structure, change of basis or symmetry transformations, can be found in classical statistics once formulated in terms of wave functions or density matrices. We construct for every quantum system an equivalent classical statistical system, such that time in quantum mechanics corresponds to the location of hypersurfaces in the classical probabilistic ensemble. For suitable choices of local observables in the classical statistical system one can, in principle, compute all expectation values and correlations of observables in the quantum system from the local probabilistic information of the associated classical statistical system. Realizing a static memory material as a quantum simulator for a given quantum system is not a matter of principle, but rather of practical simplicity.",1

128470,2,"Itinerant quantum multicriticality of two-dimensional Dirac fermions We analyze emergent quantum multicriticality for strongly interacting, massless Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions (d=2) within the framework of Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models, by considering the competing order parameters that give rise to fully gapped (insulating or superconducting) ground states. We focus only on those competing orders which can be rotated into each other by generators of an exact or emergent chiral symmetry of massless Dirac fermions, and break O(S1) and O(S2) symmetries in the ordered phase. Performing a renormalization-group analysis by using the ε=(3−d) expansion scheme, we show that all the coupling constants in the critical hyperplane flow toward a new attractive fixed point, supporting an enlarged O(S1+S2) chiral symmetry. Such a fixed point acts as an exotic quantum multicritical point (MCP), governing the continuous semimetal-insulator as well as insulator-insulator (for example, antiferromagnet to valence bond solid) quantum phase transitions. In comparison with the lower symmetric semimetal-insulator quantum critical points, possessing either O(S1) or O(S2) chiral symmetry, the MCP displays enhanced correlation length exponents, and anomalous scaling dimensions for both fermionic and bosonic fields. We discuss the scaling properties of the ratio of bosonic and fermionic masses, and the increased dc resistivity at the MCP. By computing the scaling dimensions of different local fermion bilinears in the particle-hole channel, we establish that most of the four fermion operators or generalized density-density correlation functions display faster power-law decays at the MCP compared to the free fermion and lower symmetric itinerant quantum critical points. Possible generalization of this scenario to higher-dimensional Dirac fermions is also outlined.",1

We present detailed derivations of a new method where cluster correlations co-exist with an underlying mean-field described core structure. The variation of an antisymmetrized product of cluster and core wave functions and a given nuclear interaction, provide sets of self-consistent equations of motion. First we test the technique on the neutron dripline nucleus 26O, considered as 24O surrounded by two neutrons. We choose Skyrme effective interactions between all pairs of nucleons. To ensure correct asymptotic behavior we modify the valence neutron–neutron interaction to fit the experimental scattering length in vacuum. This is an example of necessary considerations both of effective interactions between in-medium and free pairs, and renormalizations due to restrictions in allowed Hilbert space. Second, we investigate the heavier neutron dripline nucleus 72Ca, described as 70Ca plus two neutrons. We continuously vary the strength of the Skyrme interaction to fine tune the approach to the dripline. Halo structure in the s-wave is observed followed by the tendency to form Efimov states. Occurrence of Efimov states are prevented by the exceedingly unfavorable system of two light and one heavy particle. Specifically the neutron–neutron scattering length is comparable to the spatial extension of a possible Efimov state, and scaling would place the next of the states outside our galaxy. Our third application is on the proton dripline nucleus 70Kr, described as 68Se plus two protons, which is a prominent waiting point for the astrophysical rapid proton-process. We calculate radiative capture rates and discuss the capture mechanism as being either direct, sequential, virtual sequential or an energy dependent mixture of them. We do not find any 1− resonance and therefore no significant E1 transition. This is consistent with the long waiting time, since both E2 and background transitions are very slow. After the applications on dripline nuclei we discuss perspectives with improvements and applications. In the conclusion we summarize while emphasizing the merits of consistently treating both short- and large-distance properties, few- and many-body correlations, ordinary nuclear structure, and concepts of halos and Efimov states.",1

A configurable beam position monitoring data acquisition system is designed based on under-sampling theory in Iranian Light Source Facility. To evaluate the performance of this data acquisition system, after testing with synthetic signals, it is experimentally evaluated at ALBA accelerator facility. The measurement results show the precision of 0.54 μm in beam position monitoring. The measured resolution is around 0.1 μm due to the wide dynamic range of −90 dBm. Our overall results are indicative of the fact that the performance of beam position monitoring data acquisition system is quite well for the ILSF.",1

This electromagnetic field is described by (dual) solutions of the Maxwell’s equations of the Einstein–Maxwell theory. These solutions have the following important properties: (i) they are general, in the sense that the knot solutions are particular cases of them and (ii) they reduce to the electromagnetic fields in the field line representation in the flat space-time. Also, we discuss briefly the real representation of these electromagnetic configurations and write down the corresponding Einstein equations.",1

Here we provide an overview of how supernovae can go further to reveal information about what is causing the acceleration, be it dark energy or some modification to our laws of gravity. We first summarise the many different approaches used to explain or test the acceleration, including parametric models (like the standard model, LambdaCDM), non-parametric models, dark fluid models such as quintessence, and extensions to standard gravity. We also show how supernova data can be used beyond the Hubble diagram, to give information on gravitational lensing and peculiar velocities that can be used to distinguish between models that predict the same expansion history. Finally, we review the methods of statistical inference that are commonly used, making a point of separating parameter estimation from model selection.",1
128847,2,"Solar system and binary pulsars tests of the minimal momentum uncertainty principle In order to explore a minimal momentum uncertainty principle in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the minimal momentum uncertainty principle (MMUP) was proposed. The correction on the canonical commutation relation of MMUP can be parametrized by α and α′. In the macroscopic scale, MMUP could change bodies' orbital motion, which is different from the results of general relativity (GR). In the present work, we mainly focus on the influence of MMUP on the tests of the Solar System and the binary pulsars. In the Solar System, the perihelion shift of a planet has been remodeled under MMUP by the data of INPOP10a, EPM2011 and INPOP15a. In five systems of binary pulsars, the upper bounds of α and α′ are obtained by using the data of the secular periastron precessions. These five systems are PSR B1913+16, PSR B1534+12, PSR J1756-2251, PSR B2127+11C and PSR J0737-3039. Few studies about the tests have been done before and the effects of MMUP on these systems are investigated for the first time. They show that the upper bounds of α and α′ constrained by planets of the Solar System and the binary pulsars are , tighter than the previous result by at least 2 orders of magnitude. It is expected that the bounds on MMUP will be further improved by tremendous advances in techniques for deep space exploration and by new tracking data sets.",1
128872,2,"Phenomenology of muon-induced neutron yield The cosmogenic neutron yield Yn characterizes the ability of matter to produce neutrons under the effect of cosmic ray muons with spectrum and average energy corresponding to an observation depth. The yield is the basic characteristic of cosmogenic neutrons. The neutron production rate and neutron flux both are derivatives of the yield. The constancy of the exponents α and β in the known dependencies of the yield on energy Yn∝Eμα and the atomic weight Yn∝Aβ allows one to combine these dependencies in a single formula and to connect the yield with muon energy loss in matter. As a result, the phenomenological formulas for the yields of muon-induced charged pions and neutrons can be obtained. These expressions both are associated with nuclear loss of the ultrarelativistic muons, which provides the main contribution to the total neutron yield. The total yield can be described by a universal formula, which is the best fit of the experimental data.",1
128882,2,"The effect of gravitational spin–orbit coupling on the circular photon orbit in the Schwarzschild geometry The $(1,\quad 0)\oplus (0,\quad 1)$ representation of the group SL(2, C) provides a six-component spinor equivalent to the electromagnetic field tensor. By means of the $(1,\quad 0)\oplus (0,\quad 1)$ description, one can treat the photon field in curved spacetime via spin connection and the tetrad formalism, which is of great advantage to study the gravitational spin–orbit coupling of photons. Once the gravitational spin–orbit coupling is taken into account, the traditional radius of the circular photon orbit in the Schwarzschild geometry should be replaced with two different radiuses corresponding to the photons with the helicities of $\pm 1,$ respectively. Owing to the splitting of energy levels induced by the spin–orbit coupling, photons (from Hawking radiations, say) escaping from a Schwarzschild black hole are partially polarized, provided that their initial velocities possess nonzero tangential components.",1
128891,2,"Electron-Positron pairs creation close to a black hole horizon. Red-shifted annihilation line in the emergent X-ray spectra of a black hole, part I We consider a Compton cloud (CC) surrounding a black hole (BH) in an accreting BH system, where electrons propagate with thermal and bulk velocities. In that cloud, soft (disk) photons may be upscattered off these energetic electrons and attain energies of several MeV. They could then create pairs due to photon–photon interactions. In this paper, we study the formation of the 511 keV annihilation line due to this photon–photon interaction, which results in the creation of electron–positron pairs, followed by the annihilation of the created positrons with the CC electrons. The appropriate conditions for annihilation-line generation take place very close to a BH horizon within (103–104)m cm from it, where m is the BH hole mass in solar units. As a result, the created annihilation line should be seen by the Earth observer as a blackbody bump, or the so-called reflection bump at energies around (511/20) (20/z) keV, where z ∼ 20 is a typical gravitational redshift experienced by the created annihilation-line photons when they emerge. This transient feature should occur in any accreting BH system, either galactic or extragalactic. Observational evidences for this feature in several galactic BH systems is detailed in an accompanying paper. An extended hard tail of the spectrum up to 1 MeV may also be formed due to X-ray photons upscattering off created pairs.",1

Then W(A_{n-1}) and S(A_{n-1}) are the Lie superalgebras W(n) and S(n). The algebras W(g) and S(g) are constructed from the Dynkin diagram of the Borcherds-Kac-Moody superalgebras B(g) obtained by adding a single grey node (representing an odd null root) to the Dynkin diagram of g. We redefine the algebras W(A_r) and S(A_r) in terms of Chevalley generators and defining relations. We prove that all relations follow from the defining ones at level -2 and higher. The analogous definitions of the algebras in the D- and E-series are given. In the latter case the full set of defining relations is conjectured.",1
128901,2,"An analytical approach for beam loading compensation and excitation of maximum cavity field gradient in a coupled cavity-waveguide system The critical process of beam loading compensation in high intensity accelerators brings under control the undesired effect of the beam induced fields to the accelerating structures. A new analytical approach for optimizing standing wave accelerating structures is found which is hugely fast and agrees very well with simulations. A perturbative analysis of cavity and waveguide excitation based on the Bethe theorem and normal mode expansion is developed to compensate the beam loading effect and excite the maximum field gradient in the cavity. The method provides the optimum values for the coupling factor and the cavity detuning. While the approach is very accurate and agrees well with simulation software, it massively shortens the calculation time compared with the simulation software.",1
128910,2,"Resolving the observer reference class problem in cosmology The assumption that we are typical observers plays a core role in attempts to make multiverse theories empirically testable. A widely shared worry about this assumption is that it suffers from systematic ambiguity concerning the reference class of observers with respect to which typicality is assumed. As a way out, Srednicki and Hartle recommend that we empirically test typicality with respect to different candidate reference classes in analogy to how we test physical theories. Unfortunately, as this paper argues, this idea fails because typicality is not the kind of assumption that can be subjected to empirical tests. As an alternative, a background information constraint on observer reference class choice is suggested according to which the observer reference class should be chosen such that it includes precisely those observers who one could possibly be, given one’s assumed background information.",1

129214,2,"Precise limits on cosmological variability of the fine-structure constant with zinc and chromium quasar absorption lines The strongest transitions of Zn and Cr ii are the most sensitive to relative variations in the fine-structure constant (Δα/α) among the transitions commonly observed in quasar absorption spectra. They also lie within just 40 Å of each other (rest frame), so they are resistant to the main systematic error affecting most previous measurements of Δα/α: long-range distortions of the wavelength calibration. While Zn and Cr ii absorption is normally very weak in quasar spectra, we obtained high signal-to-noise, high-resolution echelle spectra from the Keck and Very Large Telescopes of nine rare systems where it is strong enough to constrain Δα/α from these species alone. These provide 12 independent measurements (three quasars were observed with both telescopes) at redshifts 1.0–2.4, 11 of which pass stringent reliability criteria. These 11 are all consistent with Δα/α = 0 within their individual uncertainties of 3.5–13 parts per million (ppm), with a weighted mean Δα/α = 0.4 ± 1.4_stat ± 0.9_sys ppm (1σ statistical and systematic uncertainties), indicating no significant cosmological variations in α. This is the first statistical sample of absorbers that is resistant to long-range calibration distortions (at the <1 ppm level), with a precision comparable to previous large samples of ∼150 (distortion-affected) absorbers. Our systematic error budget is instead dominated by much shorter range distortions repeated across echelle orders of individual spectra.",1

129300,2,"BAO Extractor: bias and redshift space effects We study a new procedure to measure the sound horizon scale via Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Instead of fitting the measured power spectrum (PS) to a theoretical model containing the cosmological informations and all the nonlinear effects, we define a procedure to project out (or to ""extract"") the oscillating component from a given nonlinear PS. We show that the BAO scale extracted in this way is extremely robust and, moreover, can be reproduced by simple theoretical models at any redshift. By using N-body simulations, we discuss the effect of the nonlinear evolution of the matter field, of redshift space distortions and of scale-dependent halo bias, showing that all these effects can be reproduced with sub-percent accuracy. We give a one-parameter theoretical model based on a simple (IR) modification of 1-loop perturbation theory, which reproduces the BAO scale from measurements of halo clustering in redshift space at better than 0.1% level and does not need any external UV input, such as coefficients measured from N-body simulations.",1

We give off shell operator identities that map the Einstein and Maxwell equations into weighted scalar equations, and using adjoint operators we construct solutions of the original field equations in a compact form from solutions of the wave-like equations. We study the extreme and zero boost weight cases; extreme boost corresponding to perturbations of Kundt spacetimes (which includes near horizon geometries of extreme black holes), and zero boost to static black holes in arbitrary dimensions.

We analyze the renormalization-group flow of the relevant ordering wave vector Q0⃗. The calculation indicates an instability of the FFLO-type states towards either a uniform superfluid or the normal state in d∈{2,3} and T>0. In d=2 this is signaled by Q0⃗ being renormalized towards zero, corresponding to the flow being attracted either to the usual Kosterlitz-Thouless fixed point or to the normal phase. We supplement a solution of the RG flow equations by a simple scaling argument, supporting the generality of the result. The tendency to reduce the magnitude of Q0⃗ by thermal fluctuations persists in d=3, where the very presence of long-range order is immune to thermal fluctuations, but the effect of attracting Q0⃗ towards zero by the flow remains observed at T>0.",1

Unlike in several other settings, the gauge fields of the angulon problem emerge in the real coordinate space, as opposed to the momentum space or some effective parameter space. Furthermore, we find a topological transition associated with making the monopole Abelian, which takes place in the vicinity of the previously reported angulon instabilities.

The GeantV project is recasting the classical simulation approach to get maximum benefit from SIMD/MIMD computational architectures and highly massive parallel systems. This involves finding the appropriate balance between several aspects influencing computational performance (floating-point performance, usage of off-chip memory bandwidth, specification of cache hierarchy, etc.) and handling a large number of program parameters that have to be optimized to achieve the best simulation throughput. This optimization task can be treated as a black-box optimization problem, which requires searching the optimum set of parameters using only point-wise function evaluations. The goal of this study is to provide a mechanism for optimizing complex systems (high energy physics particle transport simulations) with the help of genetic algorithms and evolution strategies as tuning procedures for massive parallel simulations.

We model the effects of gas drag on the BHs’ orbits, and allow BHs to grow via gas accretion, including a mode of hyper-Eddington accretion in which photon trapping and rapid gas inflow suppress any negative radiative feedback. Most initial BH configurations lead to the formation of one (but never more than one) IMBH in the centre of the protogalaxy, reaching a mass of 10^3–5 M_⊙ through hyper-Eddington growth.

gravity and quantum reflection from the attractive Casimir-Polder interaction
above a horizontal mirror. We calculate the Casimir-Polder shifts of the

experiments aiming at tests of the weak equivalence principle on antihydrogen.
Gravitationally bound quantum states have been observed with ultracold neutrons

bound states, an efficient quantum reflection is produced by the Casimir-Polder
(CP) tail above a surface 3,4,5,6 , so that quantum levitation states of atoms
can be created, where quantum reflection above a horizontal mirror balances
gravity 7. It has recently be proposed to test the weak equivalence principle
with antihydrogen by timing its free fall from a trapping device 8. The
precision of this test, of the order of 1%, could be improved by spectroscopic
measurements of quantum levitation states of antihydrogen above a material
surface, since the properties of these states are essentially determined by
gravity 9,10. However an accurate determination of the acceleration requires a
precise evaluation of Casimir-Polder shifts on quantum levitation states 11. We
consider an atom of mass m and energy E bouncing in the gravity potential mgz
and reflected on a plane horizontal mirror due to quantum reflection on the CP
potential V CP (z). The wavefunction ψ(z) obeys the one-dimensional Schrödinger

the mirror sitting at z = 0. We also suppose that atoms are absorbed when
touching the surface, which corresponds to the physical boundary condition for
antihydrogen annihilated at contact with matter. Length and energy scales
associated with the Casimir-Polder potential are respectively much smaller and
much larger than those associated with the gravitational potential g = 2 2m 2 g
1/3 ≈ 5.87 µm , g = mg g ≈ 0.602 peV , (for g ≈ 9.81 m.s −2). (2) An approximate
solution of the problem is thus found by decoupling the effects of gravity and
CP interactions. For quantum levitation states with low values of the quantum
number n, the scattering amplitudes are mainly given by the scattering length a.
It follows that the energies E 0 n",1

We discuss the Kitaev chain, SSH, and BHZ models. The role of the electromagnetic interaction in the topological insulator theory is addressed in the light of the pseudo-quantum electrodynamics (PQED). The well-known parity anomaly for massless Dirac particle is reviewed in terms of the Chern number. Within the continuum limit, a half-quantized Hall conductivity is obtained. Thereafter, by considering the lattice regularization of the Dirac theory, we show how one may obtain the well-known quantum Hall conductivity for a single Dirac cone. The renormalization of the electron energy spectrum, for both small and large coupling regime, is derived.

129968,2,"The Leggett-Garg inequality and Page-Wootters mechanism Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) implies quantum phenomena. In this light we establish that Moreva et al.'s (Phys. Rev. A, 89 (2014) 052122) experiment demonstrating Page-Wootters' mechanism (Page D. N. and Wootters W. K., Phys. Rev. D, 27 (1983) 2885, Wootters W. K., Int. J. Theor. Phys., 23 (1984) 701). falls in the quantum domain. An observer outside a 2-photons world does not detect any change in the 2-photons state, i.e., there is no time parameter for the outside observer. But an observer attached to one of the photons sees the other photon evolving and this means that there is an “internal” time. The LGI is violated for the clock photon whose state evolves with the internal time as measured by the system photon. Conditional probabilities in this 2-photons system are computed for both sharp and unsharp measurements. The conditional probability increases for entangled states as obtained by Page and Wootters for both ideal and also unsharp measurements.",1
130034,2,"Pressurized rf cavities in ionizing beams A muon collider or Higgs factory requires significant reduction of the six dimensional emittance of the beam prior to acceleration. One method to accomplish this involves building a cooling channel using high pressure gas filled radio frequency cavities. The performance of such a cavity when subjected to an intense particle beam must be investigated before this technology can be validated. To this end, a high pressure gas filled radio frequency (rf) test cell was built and placed in a 400 MeV beam line from the Fermilab linac to study the plasma evolution and its effect on the cavity. Hydrogen, deuterium, helium and nitrogen gases were studied. Additionally, sulfur hexafluoride and dry air were used as dopants to aid in the removal of plasma electrons. Measurements were made using a variety of beam intensities, gas pressures, dopant concentrations, and cavity rf electric fields, both with and without a 3 T external solenoidal magnetic field. Energy dissipation per electron-ion pair, electron-ion recombination rates, ion-ion recombination rates, and electron attachment times to SF$_6$ and O$_2$ were measured.",1
130039,2,"Diffuse Galactic antimatter from faint thermonuclear supernovae in old stellar populations Our Galaxy hosts the annihilation of a few $\times 10^{43}$ low-energy positrons every second. Radioactive isotopes capable of supplying such positrons are synthesised in stars, stellar remnants, and supernovae. For decades, however, there has been no positive identification of a main stellar positron source leading to suggestions that many positrons originate from exotic sources like the Galaxy's central super-massive black hole or dark matter annihilation. %, but such sources would not explain the recently-detected positron signal from the extended Galactic disk. Here we show that a single type of transient source, deriving from stellar populations of age 3-6 Gyr and yielding ~0.03 $M_\odot$ of the positron emitter $^{44}$Ti, can simultaneously explain the strength and morphology of the Galactic positron annihilation signal and the solar system abundance of the $^{44}$Ti decay product $^{44}$Ca. This transient is likely the merger of two low-mass white dwarfs, observed in external galaxies as the sub-luminous, thermonuclear supernova known as SN1991bg-like.",1
130070,2,"The Role of the Isospin $3/2$ Component in Elastic Neutron-Deuteron Scattering and in the Deuteron Breakup Reaction We discuss the importance of the three-nucleon isospin T = 3/2 component in elastic neutron-deuteron scattering and in the deuteron breakup reaction. The contribution of this amplitude originates from charge-independence breaking of the nucleon-nucleon potential. We study the magnitude of that contribution to the elastic scattering and breakup observables, taking the Av18 nucleon-nucleon potential alone or combined with the Urbana IX three-nucleon force as well as the locally regularized chiral N4LO nucleon-nucleon potential alone or supplemented by the chiral N2LO three-nucleon force. We find that the isospin T = 3/2 component is important for the breakup reaction and the proper treatment of charge-independence breaking in this case requires the inclusion of the 1S 0 state with isospin T = 3/2. For neutron-deuteron elastic scattering the T = 3/2 contributions are insignificant and charge-independence breaking can be accounted for by neglecting T = 3/2 component and using the effective t-matrix generated with the so-called “2/3 − 1/3″ rule.",1

Green’s function methods closely relate to other polynomial scaling approaches discussed in Chaps. 8 and 10. However, here we aim directly at a global view of the many-fermion structure. We derive the working equations for calculating many-body propagators, using both the Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction technique and the self-consistent formalism at finite temperature. Their implementation is discussed, as well as the inclusion of three-nucleon interactions. The self-consistency feature is essential to guarantee thermodynamic consistency.

130151,2,"Action functional of the Cardassian universe It is known that the Cardassian universe is successful in describing the accelerated expansion of the universe, but its dynamic equations are hard to get from the action principle. In this paper, we establish the connection between the Cardassian universe and f(T,T) gravity, where T is the torsion scalar and T is the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor. For dust matter, we find that the modified Friedmann equations from f(T,T) gravity can correspond to those of Cardassian models, and thus, a possible origin of Cardassian universe is given. We obtain the original Cardassian model, the modified polytropic Cardassian model, and the exponential Cardassian model from the Lagrangians of f(T,T) theory. Furthermore, by adding an additional term to the corresponding Lagrangians, we give three generalized Cardassian models from f(T,T) theory. Using the observation data of type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and baryon acoustic oscillations, we get the fitting results of the cosmological parameters and give constraints of model parameters for all of these models.",1
130230,2,"Renormalization of Coulomb interactions in a system of two-dimensional tilted Dirac fermions We investigate the effects of long-ranged Coulomb interactions in a tilted Dirac semimetal in two dimensions by using the perturbative renormalization-group (RG) method. Depending on the magnitude of the tilting parameter, the undoped system can have either Fermi points (type I) or Fermi lines (type II). Previous studies usually performed the renormalization-group transformations by integrating out the modes with large momenta. This is problematic when the Fermi surface is open, like type-II Dirac fermions. In this work we study the effects of Coulomb interactions, following the spirit of Shankar [Rev. Mod. Phys. 66, 129 (1994)RMPHAT0034-686110.1103/RevModPhys.66.129], by introducing a cutoff in the energy scale around the Fermi surface and integrating out the high-energy modes. For type-I Dirac fermions, our result is consistent with that of the previous work. On the other hand, we find that for type-II Dirac fermions, the magnitude of the tilting parameter increases monotonically with lowering energies. This implies the stability of type-II Dirac fermions in the presence of Coulomb interactions, in contrast with previous results. Furthermore, for type-II Dirac fermions, the velocities in different directions acquire different renormalization even if they have the same bare values. By taking into account the renormalization of the tilting parameter and the velocities due to the Coulomb interactions, we show that while the presence of a charged impurity leads only to charge redistribution around the impurity for type-I Dirac fermions, for type-II Dirac fermions, the impurity charge is completely screened, albeit with a very long screening length. The latter indicates that the temperature dependence of physical observables are essentially determined by the RG equations we derived. We illustrate this by calculating the temperature dependence of the compressibility and specific heat of the interacting tilted Dirac fermions.",1

130341,2,"Beam Diagnostics Overview for Collector Ring at FAIR The Collector Ring (CR) is a dedicated storage ring in the FAIR project, where the main emphasis is laid on the effective stochastic precooling of intense secondary beams of stable ions, rare isotopes or antiprotons. A complex operation scheme with several types of operational cycles with beams in CR starting from injection, RF gymnastics, stochastic cooling then, and finishing to extraction is foreseen. Beam parameters changes significantly during the cycles. This demands an exceptional high dynamic range for the beam instrumentation. Non-destructive methods are mandatory for high currents as well as for the low current secondary beams due to the low repetition rate. Precise measurements of all beam parameters and automatic steering with short response time are required due to the necessary exploitation of the full ring acceptances. An overview of the challenges and solutions for various diagnostic installations will be given.",1
130373,2,"Optimized operation of dielectric laser accelerators: Multibunch We present a self-consistent analysis to determine the optimal charge, gradient, and efficiency for laser driven accelerators operating with a train of microbunches. Specifically, we account for the beam loading reduction on the material occurring at the dielectric-vacuum interface. In the case of a train of microbunches, such beam loading effect could be detrimental due to energy spread, however this may be compensated by a tapered laser pulse. We ultimately propose an optimization procedure with an analytical solution for group velocity which equals to half the speed of light. This optimization results in a maximum efficiency 20% lower than the single bunch case, and a total accelerated charge of 106 electrons in the train. The approach holds promise for improving operations of dielectric laser accelerators and may have an impact on emerging laser accelerators driven by high-power optical lasers.",1
130455,2,"Interplay of Coulomb interactions and disorder in three dimensional quadratic band crossings without time-reversal symmetry and with unequal masses for conduction and valence bands Coulomb interactions famously drive three-dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals into a non-Fermi liquid phase of matter. In a previous work [Nandkishore and Parameswaran, Phys. Rev. B 95, 205106 (2017)2469-995010.1103/PhysRevB.95.205106], the effect of disorder on this non-Fermi liquid phase was investigated, assuming that the band structure was isotropic, assuming that the conduction and valence bands had the same band mass, and assuming that the disorder preserved exact time-reversal symmetry and statistical isotropy. It was shown that the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is unstable to disorder and that a runaway flow to strong disorder occurs. In this paper, we extend that analysis by relaxing the assumption of time-reversal symmetry and allowing the electron and hole masses to differ (but continuing to assume isotropy of the low energy band structure). We first incorporate time-reversal symmetry breaking disorder and demonstrate that there do not appear any new fixed points. Moreover, while the system continues to flow to strong disorder, time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder grows asymptotically more slowly than time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder, which we therefore expect should dominate the strong-coupling phase. We then allow for unequal electron and hole masses. We show that whereas asymmetry in the two masses is irrelevant in the clean system, it is relevant in the presence of disorder, such that the ‘effective masses’ of the conduction and valence bands should become sharply distinct in the low-energy limit. We calculate the RG flow equations for the disordered interacting system with unequal band masses and demonstrate that the problem exhibits a runaway flow to strong disorder. Along the runaway flow, time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder grows asymptotically more rapidly than both time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder and the Coulomb interaction.",1

130574,2,"Cosmological self-gravitating fluid solutions of shape dynamics Shape dynamics is a 3D conformally invariant theory of gravity that possesses a large set of solutions in common with general relativity. When looked at closely, these solutions are found to behave in surprising ways; in order to probe the fitness of shape dynamics as a viable alternative to General Relativity one must find and understand increasingly more-complex, less-symmetrical exact solutions on which to base perturbative studies and numerical analyses to compare them with data. Spherically symmetric exact solutions have been studied, but only in a static vacuum setup. In this work we construct a class of time-dependent exact solutions of Shape Dynamics from first principles, representing a central inhomogeneity in an evolving cosmological environment. By assuming only a perfect fluid source in a spherically symmetric geometry, we show that this fully dynamic nonvacuum solution satisfies in all generality the Hamiltonian structure of shape dynamics. The simplest choice of solutions is shown to be a member of the McVittie family.",1
130610,2,"Reactions of exotic nuclei with the quark-meson coupling model The nucleon-nucleon interaction is an important requirement for investigations of nuclear structure and reactions, as well as for astrophysical models such as r-process nucleosynthesis and neutron stars. The traditional approach to low-energy nuclear physics is to treat nucleons as immutable objects interacting via phenomenological forces. The use of phenomenological interactions, rather than one derived from a microscopic theory, raises questions as to the reliability of predictions for exotic regions of the nuclear chart. The quark-meson coupling (QMC) model uses a relativistic mean-field approach to provide a microscopically derived nucleon-nucleon interaction, which takes into account the quark structure of the nucleon.The Skyrme energy density functional is a popular phenomenological tool in studies of nuclear structure and reactions. In this work, the QMC density functional was used to produce a set of Skyrme parameterisations, in the hopes that they will give more reliable predictions for exotic nuclei. In conjunction with Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations, the Skyrme-QMC (SQMC) parameterisations have been used to model the ground-state properties of individual nuclei and nucleus-nucleus potentials for Ca + Sn reactions. The SQMC parameterisation performs with an accuracy comparable to modern phenomenological functionals. From this, one can investigate the importance of the isovector terms of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, which are particularly significant for exotic, neutron-rich regions of the nuclear chart.One of the notable successes of the QMC model is its derivation of nuclear spin-orbit coupling. The isovector dependence of the spin-orbit equation of state is remarkably similar to that of the modern UNEDF1 phenomenological density functional. HFB calculations along the Sn isotopic chain reveal that the isovector properties of the spin-orbit term impact binding energies to a level that will be significant for astrophysical r-process modelling.",1

Its focal plane consists of modularized tiles of antenna-coupled transition edge sensors (TESs), similar to those used in Bicep2 and the Keck Array. The increased per-receiver optical throughput compared to Bicep2/Keck Array, due to both its faster f=1:7 optics and the larger aperture, more than doubles the combined mapping speed of the Bicep/Keck program. The Bicep3 receiver was recently upgraded to a full complement of 20 tiles of detectors (2560 TESs) and is now beginning its second year of observation (and first science season) at the South Pole. We report on its current performance and observing plans. Given its high per-receiver throughput while maintaining the advantages of a compact design, Bicep3- class receivers are ideally suited as building blocks for a 3rd-generation CMB experiment, consisting of multiple receivers spanning 35 GHz to 270 GHz with total detector count in the tens of thousands.

130748,2,"Schrodinger's Cat and World History: The Many Worlds Interpretation of Alternative Facts I propose that much recent history can be explained by hypothesizing that sometime during the last quarter of 2016, the history of the world underwent a macroscopic quantum tunneling event, creating, according to the Many Worlds Interpretation, a new branch of the multiverse in which my consciousness and that of my readers is now trapped. The failure of much political polling is then understood by assuming that the particular branch we are on had very low amplitude in the quantum wave function of the multiverse. In this view, one must take a different attitude towards alternative facts than that proposed by the mainstream media. We know that quantum tunneling can change the low energy laws of physics in the different branches of the wave function. Alternative facts may simply be the reflection of the media's ignorance of the state of the world after a quantum transition of this magnitude.",1
130761,2,"A segmented conical electric lens for optimization of the beam spot of the low-energy muon facility at PSI: a Geant4 simulation analysis The low-energy muon facility at PSI provides nearly fully polarized positive muons with tunable energies in the keV range to carry out muon spin rotation (LE- $\upmu $ SR) experiments with nanometer depth resolution on thin films, heterostructures, and near-surface regions. The low-energy muon beam is focused and transported to the sample by electrostatic lenses. In order to achieve a minimum beam spot size at the sample position and to enable the steering of the beam in the horizontal and vertical direction, a special electrostatic device has been implemented close to the sample position. It consists of a cylinder at ground potential followed by four conically shaped electrodes, which can be operated at different electric potential. In LE- $\upmu $ SR experiments, an electric field at the sample along the beam direction can be applied to accelerate/decelerate muons to different energies (0.5–30 keV). Additionally, a horizontal or vertical magnetic field can be superimposed for transverse or longitudinal field $\upmu $ SR experiments. The focusing properties of the conical lens in the presence of these additional electric and magnetic fields have been investigated and optimized by Geant4 simulations. Some experimental tests were also performed and show that the simulation well describes the experimental setup.",1

130929,2,"Photon motion in Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes We study the general motion of photons in the Kerr–de Sitter black-hole and naked singularity spacetimes. The motion is governed by the impact parameters X, related to the axial symmetry of the spacetime, and q, related to its hidden symmetry. Appropriate ‘effective potentials’ governing the latitudinal and radial motion are introduced and their behavior is examined by the ‘Chinese boxes’ technique giving regions allowed for the motion in terms of the impact parameters. Restrictions on the impact parameters X and q are established in dependence on the spacetime parameters $M, \Lambda , a$ . The motion can be of orbital type (crossing the equatorial plane, $q>0$ ) and vortical type (tied above or below the equatorial plane, $q<0$ ). It is shown that for negative values of q, the reality conditions imposed on the latitudinal motion yield stronger constraints on the parameter X than that following from the reality condition of the radial motion, excluding the existence of vortical motion of constant radius. The properties of the spherical photon orbits of the orbital type are determined and used along with the properties of the effective potentials as criteria of classification of the KdS spacetimes according to the properties of the motion of the photon.",1
130931,2,"On flux integrals for generalized Melvin solution related to simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra A generalized Melvin solution for an arbitrary simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathcal G$ is considered. The solution contains a metric, n Abelian 2-forms and n scalar fields, where n is the rank of $\mathcal G$ . It is governed by a set of n moduli functions $H_s(z)$ obeying n ordinary differential equations with certain boundary conditions imposed. It was conjectured earlier that these functions should be polynomials—the so-called fluxbrane polynomials. These polynomials depend upon integration constants $q_s$ , $s = 1,\dots ,n$ . In the case when the conjecture on the polynomial structure for the Lie algebra $\mathcal G$ is satisfied, it is proved that 2-form flux integrals $\Phi ^s$ over a proper 2d submanifold are finite and obey the relations $q_s \Phi ^s = 4 \pi n_s h_s$ , where the $h_s > 0$ are certain constants (related to dilatonic coupling vectors) and the $n_s$ are powers of the polynomials, which are components of a twice dual Weyl vector in the basis of simple (co-)roots, $s = 1,\dots ,n$ . The main relations of the paper are valid for a solution corresponding to a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathcal G$ .

We investigate this transition for a general spherically-symmetric metric outside the shell and find that it occurs generically. Once the shell is null its persistence on a null trajectory can be ensured by several mechanisms that we describe. Using the outgoing Vaidya metric as an example we show that if a dust shell acquires surface pressure on its transition to a null trajectory it can evade the Schwarzschild radius through its collapse. Alternatively, the pressureless collapse may continue if the exterior geometry acquires a more general form.",1

131066,2,"Bell inequalities for continuous-variable systems in generic squeezed states Bell inequalities for continuous-variable bipartite systems are studied. The inequalities are expressed in terms of pseudo–spin operators, and quantum expectation values are calculated for generic two-mode squeezed states characterized by a squeezing parameter r and a squeezing angle φ. Allowing for generic values of the squeezing angle is especially relevant when φ is not under experimental control, such as in cosmic inflation, where small quantum fluctuations in the early universe are responsible for structures formation. Compared to previous studies restricted to φ=0 and to a fixed orientation of the pseudo–spin operators, allowing for φ≠0 and optimizing the angular configuration leads to a completely new and rich phenomenology. Two dual schemes of approximation are designed that allow for comprehensive exploration of the squeezing parameter space. In particular, it is found that Bell inequalities can be violated when the squeezing parameter r is large enough, r≳1.12, and the squeezing angle φ is small enough, φ≲0.34e−r.",1
131082,2,"Robustness of $S$-deformation method for black hole stability analysis The $S$-deformation method is a useful way to show the linear mode stability of a black hole when the perturbed field equation takes the form of the Schr\""odinger equation. While previous works where many explicit examples are studied suggest that this method works well, general discussion is not given yet explicitly. In this paper, we show the existence of a regular $S$-deformation when a black hole spacetime is stable under some reasonable assumptions. This $S$-deformation is constructed from a solution of a differential equation. We also show that the boundary condition for the differential equation which corresponds to a regular $S$-deformation has a one-parameter degree of freedom with a finite range. This is the reason why any fine-tune technique is not needed to find $S$-deformation numerically.",1
131099,2,"Adaptive Linear Predictor FIR Filter Based on the Cyclone V FPGA With HPS to Reduce Narrow Band RFI in Radio Detection of Cosmic Rays We are presenting a new approach to a filtering of radio frequency interference (RFI) in the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), which studies the electromagnetic part of the extensive air showers. Radio stations can observe radio signals caused by coherent emissions due to geomagnetic radiation and charge excess processes. AERA observes the frequency band from 30 to 80 MHz. This range is highly contaminated by human-made RFI. In order to improve the signal to noise ratio RFI filters are used in AERA to suppress this contamination. The filter has already been tested with real AERA radio stations in the Argentinean Pampas with very successful results. The linear equations were solved either in the virtual soft-core NIOS® processor (implemented in the FPGA chip as a net of logic elements) or in the external Voipac PXA270M ARM processor. The NIOS® processor is relatively slow (50 MHz internal clock), and the calculations performed in an external processor consume a significant amount of time for data exchange between the FPGA and the processor. Tests showed very good efficiency of the RFI suppression for stationary (long-term) contaminations. However, we observed short-time contaminations, which could not be suppressed either by the IIR-notch filter or by the FIR filter based on the linear predictions. For the LP FIR filter, the refresh time of the filter coefficients was too long and the filter did not keep up with the changes in the contamination structure, mainly due to a long calculation time in a slow processors. We propose to use the Cyclone® V SE chip with an embedded micro-controller operating with a 925 MHz internal clock to significantly reduce the refreshment time of the FIR coefficients. First results in the laboratory are very promising.",1
131137,2,"Positioning systems for underground tunnel environments In the last years the world has witnessed a remarkable change in the computing concept by entering the mobile era. Incredibly powerful smartphones have proliferated at stunning pace and tablet computers are capable of running demanding applications and meet new business requirements. Being wireless, localization has become crucial not only to serve individuals but also help companies in industrial and safety processes. In the context of the Radiation Protection group at CERN, automatic localization, besides allowing to find people, would help improving the radiation surveys performed regularly along the accelerator tunnels. The research presented in this thesis attempts to answer questions relatively to the viability of localization in a harsh conditions tunnel: “Is localization in a very long tunnel possible, meeting its restrictions and without incurring prohibitive costs and infrastructure?”, “Can one achieve meter-level accuracy with GSM deployed over leaky-feeder?”, “Is it possible to prototype a localization system without a team of hardware engineers?”. To help answering those questions, in the first place, a comprehensive characterization of the power profile in the LHC tunnel was performed for both GSM and WLAN networks, which were transmitted over leaky-feeder cable. Subsequently, several RSSI fingerprinting methods were explored. During the characterization of the power profile, it was noticeable that GSM suffered low attenuation as it propagated in the leaky feeder, at the same time it exhibited significant changes in a short scale and among measurement sessions. Such findings motivated the research of new variants of KNN better suited for leaky-feeder, as well as fusion techniques taking WLAN network in addition. It was found that, even though KNN variants could bring interesting improvements, up to 27%, much more significant gains were attained when considering signals from the WLAN as they exhibited higher attenuation, enabling for 30 meters accuracy in 91% of the cases. To further improve accuracy to the envisaged levels, time-of-flight techniques in narrowband were investigated. A complementary positioning system based on phase delay and aided by synchronization units is proposed and several tests are implemented using Software Defined Radio. Despite the limitations of SDR in achieving phase stability, a method following a round-trip design was shown to correctly stabilize and precisely detect small displacements.",1

Considering an upcoming generation of experiments, we demonstrate that intensity mapping of CO and [CII] emission can improve upon the current best constraints from the Planck satellite. We show that measurement of the CO intensity power spectrum by a hypothetical next stage of the ground-based COMAP experiment can achieve $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}) = 3.7$, and that the proposed CMB satellite mission PIXIE can achieve $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}) = 4.9$ via measurement of [CII] intensity power spectrum.",1

The goal here is to provide large-area detectors with a high detection efficiency for carbon or proton beams, yielding time and position measurement at count rates greater than 100 MHz. A time resolution ranging from 20 ps up to 40 ps and an energy resolution varying from 7 % up to 10% were measured. It allowed us to conclude that poly-crystal CVD diamond detectors are good candidates for this application.",1
131342,2,"Testing the equivalence principle on cosmological scales The equivalence principle, that is one of the main pillars of general relativity, is very well tested in the Solar system; however, its validity is more uncertain on cosmological scales, or when dark matter is concerned. This article shows that relativistic effects in the large-scale structure can be used to directly test whether dark matter satisfies Euler's equation, i.e. whether its free fall is characterised by geodesic motion, just like baryons and light. After having proposed a general parametrisation for deviations from Euler's equation, we perform Fisher-matrix forecasts for future surveys like DESI and the SKA, and show that such deviations can be constrained with a precision of order 10%. Deviations from Euler's equation cannot be tested directly with standard methods like redshift-space distortions and gravitational lensing, since these observables are not sensitive to the time component of the metric. Our analysis shows therefore that relativistic effects bring new and complementary constraints to alternative theories of gravity.",1
131345,2,"Geometry defects in Bosonic symmetry protected topological phases In this paper we focus on the interplay between geometry defects and topological properties in bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We start from eight copies of 3D time-reversal (T) invariant topological superconductors (TSC) on a crystal lattice. We melt the lattice by condensation of disclinations and therefore restore the rotation symmetry. Such a disclination condensation procedure confines the fermion and afterwards turns the system into a 3D boson topological liquid crystal (TCL). The low energy effective theory of this crystalline-liquid transition contains a topological term inherited from the geometry axion response in TSC. In addition, we investigate the interplay between dislocation and superfluid vortex on the surface of TCL. We demonstrate that the T and translation invariant surface state is a double [eTmT] state with intrinsic surface topological order. We also look into the exotic behavior of dislocation in the 2D boson SPT state described by an O(4) nonlinear σ model (NLσM) with topological Θ term. By dressing the O(4) vector with spiral order and gauging the symmetry, the dislocation has mutual semion statistics with the gauge flux. Further reducing the O(4)NLσM to the Ising limit, we arrive at the Levin-Gu model with stripy modulation whose dislocation has nontrivial braiding statistics.",1

131431,2,"Entanglement negativity in random spin chains We investigate the logarithmic negativity in strongly disordered spin chains in the random-singlet phase. We focus on the spin-12 random Heisenberg chain and the random XX chain. We find that for two arbitrary intervals, the disorder-averaged negativity and the mutual information are proportional to the number of singlets shared between the two intervals. Using the strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG), we prove that the negativity of two adjacent intervals grows logarithmically with the intervals' length. In particular, the scaling behavior is the same as in conformal field theory, but with a different prefactor. For two disjoint intervals the negativity is given by a universal simple function of the cross ratio, reflecting scale invariance. As a function of the distance of the two intervals, the negativity decays algebraically in contrast with the exponential behavior in clean models. We confirm our predictions using a numerical implementation of the SDRG method. Finally, we also implement density matrix renormalization group simulations for the negativity in open spin chains. The chains accessible in the presence of strong disorder are not sufficiently long to provide a reliable confirmation of the SDRG results.",1
131474,2,"Experimental benchmark of the NINJA code for application to the Linac4 H− ion source plasma For a dedicated performance optimization of negative hydrogen ion sources applied at particle accelerators, a detailed assessment of the plasma processes is required. Due to the compact design of these sources, diagnostic access is typically limited to optical emission spectroscopy yielding only lineof-sight integrated results. In order to allow for a spatially resolved investigation, the electromagnetic particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision code NINJA has been developed for the Linac4 ion source at CERN. This code considers the RF field generated by the ICP coil as well as the external static magnetic fields and calculates self-consistently the resulting discharge properties. NINJA is benchmarked at the diagnostically well accessible lab experiment CHARLIE (Concept studies for Helicon Assisted RF Low pressure Ion sourcEs) at varying RF power and gas pressure. A good general agreement is observed between experiment and simulation although the simulated electron density trends for varying pressure and power as well as the absolute electron temperature values deviate slightly from the measured ones. This can be explained by the assumption of strong inductive coupling in NINJA, whereas the CHARLIE discharges show the characteristics of loosely coupled plasmas. For the Linac4 plasma, this assumption is valid. Accordingly, both the absolute values of the accessible plasma parameters and their trends for varying RF power agree well in measurement and simulation. At varying RF power, the H− current extracted from the Linac4 source peaks at 40 kW. For volume operation, this is perfectly reflected by assessing the processes in front of the extraction aperture based on the simulation results where the highest H− density is obtained for the same power level. In surface operation, the production of negative hydrogen ions at the converter surface can only be considered by specialized beam formation codes, which require plasma parameters as input. It has been demonstrated that this input can be provided reliably by the NINJA code.",1
131504,2,"Experiences and Prospects of Nuclear Astrophysics in Underground Laboratories Impressive progress has been made in the course the last decades in understanding astrophysical objects. Increasing precision of nuclear physics data has contributed significantly to this success, but now a better understanding of several important findings is frequently limited by uncertainties related to the available nuclear physics data. Consequently it is desirable to improve significantly the quality of these data. An important step towards higher precision is an excellent signal to background ratio of the data. Placing an accelerator facility inside an underground laboratory to reduce the cosmic ray induced background by six orders of magnitude is a powerful method to reach this goal. Nevertheless careful reduction of environmental and beam induced background must still be considered. Experience in the field of underground nuclear astrophysics has been gained since 20 years due to the pioneering work of the LUNA Collaboration (Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) operating inside the underground laboratories of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy. Based on the success of this work presently also several other projects for underground laboratories dedicated to nuclear astrophysics are being pursued worldwide. This contribution gives a survey of the past experience in underground nuclear astrophysics as well as an outlook on future developments",1
131521,2,"Particle-in-cell Simulations of Global Relativistic Jets with Helical Magnetic Fields We study the interaction of relativistic jets with their environment, using 3-dimen- sional relativistic particle-in-cell simulations for two cases of jet composition: (i) electron-proton (e− − p+) and (ii) electron-positron (e±) plasmas containing helical magnetic fields. We have performed simulations of “global” jets containing helical magnetic fields in order to examine how helical magnetic fields affect kinetic instabilities such as the Weibel instability, the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the Mushroom instability. We have found that these kinetic instabilities are suppressed and new types of instabilities can grow. For the e− − p+ jet, a recollimation-like instability occurs and jet electrons are strongly perturbed, whereas for the e± jet, a recollimation-like instability occurs at early times followed by kinetic instability and the general structure is similar to a simulation without a helical magnetic field. We plan to perform further simulations using much larger systems to confirm these new findings.",1
131563,2,"Parametric study of transport beam lines for electron beams accelerated by laser-plasma interaction In the last decade, laser-plasma acceleration of high-energy electrons has attracted strong attention in different fields. Electrons with maximum energies in the GeV range can be laser-accelerated within a few cm using multi-hundreds terawatt (TW) lasers, yielding to very high beam currents at the source (electron bunches with up to tens-hundreds of pC in a few fs). While initially the challenge was to increase the maximum achievable electron energy, today strong effort is put in the control and usability of these laser-generated beams that still lack of some features in order to be used for applications where currently conventional, radio-frequency (RF) based, electron beam lines represent the most common and efficient solution. Several improvements have been suggested for this purpose, some of them acting directly on the plasma source, some using beam shaping tools located downstream. Concerning the latter, several studies have suggested the use of conventional accelerator magnetic devices (such as quadrupoles and solenoids) as an easy implementable solution when the laser-plasma accelerated beam requires optimization. In this paper, we report on a parametric study related to the transport of electron beams accelerated by laser-plasma interaction, using conventional accelerator elements and tools. We focus on both, high energy electron beams in the GeV range, as produced on petawatt (PW) class laser systems, and on lower energy electron beams in the hundreds of MeV range, as nowadays routinely obtained on commercially available multi-hundred TW laser systems. For both scenarios, our study allows understanding what are the crucial parameters that enable laser-plasma accelerators to compete with conventional ones and allow for a beam transport. We show that suitable working points require a tradeoff-combination between low beam divergence and narrow energy spread.",1
131658,2,"Certified Randomness from a Two-Level System in a Relativistic Quantum Field Randomness is an indispensable resource in modern science and information technology. Fortunately, an experimentally simple procedure exists to generate randomness with well-characterized devices: measuring a quantum system in a basis complementary to its preparation. Towards realizing this goal one may consider using atoms or superconducting qubits, promising candidates for quantum information processing. However, their unavoidable interaction with the electromagnetic field affects their dynamics. At large time scales, this can result in decoherence. Smaller time scales in principle avoid this problem, but may not be well analyzed under the usual rotating wave and single mode approximation (RWA and SMA) which break the relativistic nature of quantum field theory. Here, we use a fully relativistic analysis to quantify the information that an adversary with access to the field could get on the result of an atomic measurement. Surprisingly, we find that the adversary's guessing probability is not minimized for atoms initially prepared in the ground state (an intuition derived from the RWA and SMA model).",1
131674,2,"Computational Relativistic Electrodynamics: New Algorithms, Parallel Software, and Applications to Accelerator Design A parallel, fully relativistic, 3D electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EM-PIC) code, named SPACE, has been developed for the simulation of relativistic particle beams, beam - plasma interaction, and plasma chemistry. New algorithms such as atomic processes in plasma, proper boundary conditions, and an efficient method for highly-relativistic beams in non-relativistic plasma have been developed. Algorithms for atomic process include ionization of neutral atoms by electron impact, recombination of plasma, and electron attachment on dopants in dense neutral gases. The code has been used for the simulation of processes in high-pressure radio-frequency (RF) cavity (HPRF) program at Fermilab. Advanced numerical simulations resolve all physically relevant processes in RF cavity filled with high-pressure gases and interacting with proton beams. Simulations also support broader research on the design of muon cooling devices. From simulation studies of microphysics processes, macroscopic and experimentally measurable quantities have been derived. Through comparison with experiments in the MTA, simulations quantified several uncertain values of plasma properties such as effective recombination rates and the attachment time of electrons to dopant molecules. Simulations have achieved very good agreement with experiments on plasma loading and related processes. The experimentally validated code SPACE will be used for simulations of muon cooling devices in regimes beyond current experimental capabilities. In addition, the code is used to study advanced coherent electron cooling (ACeC) for the e-RHIC project at BNL. Simulations study the modulation effect of highly relativistic ions of gold on co-propagating electron plasma and the amplification of modulation. Parallel simulations were able to track every real electron in physically relevant domains.",1
131805,2,"Oscillations Beyond Three-Neutrino Mixing The LSND, Gallium and reactor neutrino anomalies can be explained by short-
baseline neu-trino oscillations due to the mixing of the active neutrinos with
sterile neutrinos at the eV scale. I review the results of a 3+1 global fit of
short-baseline neutrino oscillation data which includes the recent measurements
of the MINOS, IceCube, and NEOS experiments. The LSND, 1, 2 Gallium 3–7 and
reactor 8–10 anomalies are intriguing indications in favor of short-baseline
neutrino oscillations due to sterile neutrinos at the eV scale. Here, I consider
3+1 active-sterile neutrino mixing (see Ref. [11]), in which there are three
sub-eV massive neutrinos ν 1 , ν 2 , and ν 3 which are the main constituents of
the three standard active neutrinos ν e , ν µ , ν τ and there is a fourth
massive neutrino ν 4 at the eV scale which is mainly sterile (ν 4 ν s). In the
framework of 3+1 active-sterile mixing, short-baseline (SBL) experiments are
sensitive only to the oscillations generated by the squared-mass difference ∆m 2
41 ∆m 2 42 ∆m 2 43 1 eV 2 , with ∆m 2 jk ≡ m 2 j − m 2 k , that is much larger
than the the solar squared-mass difference ∆m 2 SOL = ∆m 2 21 ≈ 7.4 × 10 −5 eV 2
and the atmospheric squared-mass difference ∆m 2 ATM = |∆m 2 31 | |∆m 2 32 | ≈
2.5 × 10 −3 eV 2 , which generate the observed solar, atmospheric and long-
baseline neutrino oscillations explained by the standard three-neutrino mixing.
12 The 3+1 active-sterile mixing scheme is a perturbation of the standard three-
neutrino mixing in which the 3 × 3 unitary mixing matrix U is extended to a 4 ×
4 unitary mixing matrix with |U e4 | 2 , |U µ4 | 2 , |U τ 4 | 2 1. The effective
oscillation probabilities of the flavor neutrinos in short-baseline experiments
are given by 13 P (SBL) αβ δ αβ − sin 2 2ϑ αβ sin 2 ∆m 2 41 L 4E , (1) where α,
β = e, µ, τ, s, L is the source-detector distance and E is the neutrino energy.
The short-baseline oscillation amplitudes depend only on the absolute values of
the elements in the fourth column of the mixing matrix: sin 2 2ϑ αβ = 4|U α4 | 2
δ αβ − |U β4 | 2. (2) Hence, the transition probabilities of neutrinos and
antineutrinos are equal and it is not possible to measure in short-baseline
experiments any CP-violating effect generated by the complex phases in the
mixing matrix. CP violating effects due to active-sterile neutrino mixing can,
however, be observed in long-baseline 14–23 and solar 24 neutrino experiments.

131867,2,"Eigenvalue tunneling and decay of quenched random network We consider the canonical ensemble of N-vertex Erdős-Rényi (ER) random topological graphs with quenched vertex degree, and with fugacity μ for each closed triple of bonds. We claim complete defragmentation of large-N graphs into the collection of [p−1] almost full subgraphs (cliques) above critical fugacity, μc, where p is the ER bond formation probability. Evolution of the spectral density, ρ(λ), of the adjacency matrix with increasing μ leads to the formation of a multizonal support for μ>μc. Eigenvalue tunneling from the central zone to the side one means formation of a new clique in the defragmentation process. The adjacency matrix of the network ground state has a block-diagonal form, where the number of vertices in blocks fluctuates around the mean value Np. The spectral density of the whole network in this regime has triangular shape. We interpret the phenomena from the viewpoint of the conventional random matrix model and speculate about possible physical applications.",1
131887,2,Theory of non-local point transformations - Part 2: General form and Gedanken experiment The problem is posed of further extending the axiomatic construction proposed in Part 1 for non-local point transformations mapping in each other different curved space times. The new transformations apply to curved space times when expressed in arbitrary coordinate systems. It is shown that the solution permits to achieve an ideal (Gedanken) experiment realizing a suitable kind of phase-space transformation on point-particle classical dynamical systems. Applications of the theory are discussed both for diagonal and non-diagonal metric tensors.,1
131910,2,"Joint Bayesian estimation of tensor and lensing B-modes in the power spectrum of CMB polarization data We investigate the performance of a simple Bayesian fitting approach to correct the cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization for gravitational lensing effects in the recovered probability distribution of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We perform a two-dimensional power spectrum fit of the amplitude of the primordial B modes (tensor-to-scalar ratio, r) and the amplitude of the lensing B modes (parameter A_lens), jointly with the estimation of the astrophysical foregrounds including both synchrotron and thermal dust emissions. Using this Bayesian framework, we forecast the ability of the proposed CMB space mission LiteBIRD to constrain r in the presence of realistic lensing and foreground contributions. We compute the joint posterior distribution of r and A_lens, which we improve by adopting a prior on A_lens taken from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) measurement. As it applies to the power spectrum, this approach cannot mitigate the uncertainty on r that is due to E-mode cosmic variance transferred to B modes by lensing, unlike standard delensing techniques that are performed on maps. However, the method allows us to correct for the bias on r induced by lensing, at the expense of a larger uncertainty due to the increased volume of the parameter space. We quantify, for different values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the trade-off between bias correction and increase of uncertainty on r. For LiteBIRD simulations, which include foregrounds and lensing contamination, we find that correcting the foreground-cleaned CMB B-mode power spectrum for the lensing bias, not the lensing cosmic variance, still guarantees a 3σ detection of r = 5 × 10^−3. The significance of the detection is increased to 6σ when the current SPT prior on A_lens is adopted.",1

This work presents the current version 3 of the \helmod{} model and reviews how main processes involved in GCR propagation were implemented.~The treatment includes the so-called particle drift effects --~e.g., those resulting, for instance, from the extension of the neutral current sheet inside the heliosphere and from the curvature and gradient of the IMF --, which affect the transport of particles entering the solar cavity as a function of their charge sign.~The \helmod{} model is capable to provide modulated spectra which well agree within the experimental errors with those measured by AMS-01, BESS, PAMELA and AMS-02 during the solar cycles 23 and 24.~Furthermore, the counting rate measured by Ulysses at +/- 80degree of solar latitude and 1 to 5\,AU was also found in agreement with that expected by \helmod{} code version 3.",1
132045,2,"Casimir-Polder interaction of neutrons with metal or dielectric surfaces We predict a repulsive Casimir-Polder-type dispersion interaction between a single neutron and a metal or dielectric surface. Our model scenario assumes a single neutron subject to an external magnetic field. Due to its intrinsic magnetic moment, the neutron then forms a magnetisable two-level system which can exchange virtual photons with a nearby surface. The resulting dispersion interaction between a purely magnetic object (neutron) and a purely electric one (surface) is found to be repulsive. Its magnitude is considerably smaller than than the standard atom-surface Casimir-Polder force due to the magnetic nature of the interaction and the smallness of the electron-to-neutron mass ratio. Nevertheless, we show that it can be comparable to the gravitational potential of the same surface.",1

132180,2,"Weak lensing by galaxy troughs with modified gravity We study the imprints that theories of gravity beyond GR can leave on the lensing signal around line of sight directions that are predominantly halo-underdense (called troughs) and halo-overdense. To carry out our investigations, we consider the normal branch of DGP gravity, as well as a phenomenological variant thereof that directly modifies the lensing potential. The predictions of these models are obtained with N-body simulation and ray-tracing methods using the ECOSMOG and Ray-Ramses codes. We analyse the stacked lensing convergence profiles around the underdense and overdense lines of sight, which exhibit, respectively, a suppression and a boost w.r.t. the mean in the field of view. The modifications to gravity in these models strengthen the signal w.r.t. ΛCDM in a scale-independent way. We find that the size of this effect is the same for both underdense and overdense lines of sight, which implies that the density field along the overdense directions on the sky is not sufficiently evolved to trigger the suppression effects of the screening mechanism. These results are robust to variations in the minimum halo mass and redshift ranges used to identify the lines of sight, as well as to different line of sight aperture sizes and criteria for their underdensity and overdensity thresholds.",1
132201,2,"Some Aspects in Cosmological Perturbation Theory and ƒ (R) Gravity General Relativity, the currently accepted theory of gravity, has not been thoroughly tested on very large scales. Therefore, alternative or extended models provide a viable alternative to Einstein’s theory. In this thesis I present the results of my research projects together with the Grupo de Gravitación y Cosmología at Universidad Nacional de Colombia; such projects were motivated by my time at Bonn University.
In the first part, we address the topics related with the metric ƒ (R) gravity, including the study of the boundary term for the action in this theory. The Geodesic Deviation Equation (GDE) in metric ƒ (R) gravity is also studied. Finally, the results are applied to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime metric and some perspectives on use the of GDE as a cosmological tool are commented.
The second part discusses a proposal of using second order cosmological perturbation theory to explore the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields. The main result is a dynamo-like cosmological equation for the evolution of the magnetic fields. The couplings between the perturbations in the metric and the magnetic fields are present in the dynamo equation, opening a new perspective in the amplification of magnetic fields at early stages of the universe expansion.
The final part of this work is in the field of stellar kinematics in galaxies. It is a project that started at Sternwarte-Bonn Institut some years ago. Here we study the stellar and gas kinematics in HCG 90. Furthermore, we analyze the rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles for the galaxies in the core of the group. Some possible future applications of the work are discuss.",1
132533,2,"Cosmological Tests With Strong Gravitational Lenses using Gaussian Processes Strong gravitational lenses provide source/lens distance ratios ${\mathcal {D}}_{\mathrm{obs}}$ useful in cosmological tests. Previously, a catalog of 69 such systems was used in a one-on-one comparison between the standard model, $\varLambda $ CDM, and the $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ universe, which has thus far been favored by the application of model selection tools to many other kinds of data. But in that work, the use of model parametric fits to the observations could not easily distinguish between these two cosmologies, in part due to the limited measurement precision. Here, we instead use recently developed methods based on Gaussian Processes (GP), in which ${\mathcal {D}}_{\mathrm{obs}}$ may be reconstructed directly from the data without assuming any parametric form. This approach not only smooths out the reconstructed function representing the data, but also reduces the size of the $1\sigma $ confidence regions, thereby providing greater power to discern between different models. With the current sample size, we show that analyzing strong lenses with a GP approach can definitely improve the model comparisons, producing probability differences in the range $\sim $ 10–30%. These results are still marginal, however, given the relatively small sample. Nonetheless, we conclude that the probability of $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ being the correct cosmology is somewhat higher than that of $\varLambda $ CDM, with a degree of significance that grows with the number of sources in the subsamples we consider. Future surveys will significantly grow the catalog of strong lenses and will therefore benefit considerably from the GP method we describe here. In addition, we point out that if the $R_{\mathrm{h}}=ct$ universe is eventually shown to be the correct cosmology, the lack of free parameters in the study of strong lenses should provide a remarkably powerful tool for uncovering the mass structure in lensing galaxies.",1
132606,2,"Giant Primeval Magnetic Dipoles Macroscopic magnetic dipoles are considered cosmic dark matter. Permanent magnetism in relativistic field structures can involve some form of superconductivity, one example being current-carrying string loops (“springs”) with vanishing net tension. We derive the cross-section for free classical dipoles to collide, finding it depends weakly on orientation when mutual precession is rapid. The collision rate of “spring” loops with tension ${ \mathcal T }\sim {10}^{-8}{c}^{4}/G$ in galactic halos approaches the measured rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) if the loops compose most of the dark matter. A large superconducting dipole (LSD) with mass ∼10(20) g and size ∼1 mm will form a ∼100 km magnetosphere moving through interstellar plasma. Although hydromagnetic drag is generally weak, it is strong enough to capture some LSDs into long-lived rings orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that form by the direct collapse of massive gas clouds. Repeated collisions near young SMBHs could dominate the global collision rate, thereby broadening the dipole mass spectrum. Colliding LSDs produce tiny, hot electromagnetic explosions. The accompanying paper shows that these explosions couple effectively to propagating low-frequency electromagnetic modes, with output peaking at 0.01–1 THz. We describe several constraints on, and predictions of, LSDs as cosmic dark matter. The shock formed by an infalling LSD triggers self-sustained thermonuclear burning in a C/O (ONeMg) white dwarf (WD) of mass ≳1 M (⊙) (1.3 M (⊙)). The spark is generally located off the center of the WD. The rate of LSD-induced explosions matches the observed rate of Type Ia supernovae.",1
132612,2,"rf breakdown tests of mm-wave metallic accelerating structures We are exploring the physics and frequency-scaling of vacuum rf breakdowns at sub-THz frequencies. We present the experimental results of rf tests performed in metallic mm-wave accelerating structures. These experiments were carried out at the facility for advanced accelerator experimental tests (FACET) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The rf fields were excited by the FACET ultrarelativistic electron beam. We compared the performances of metal structures made with copper and stainless steel. The rf frequency of the fundamental accelerating mode, propagating in the structures at the speed of light, varies from 115 to 140 GHz. The traveling wave structures are 0.1 m long and composed of 125 coupled cavities each. We determined the peak electric field and pulse length where the structures were not damaged by rf breakdowns. We calculated the electric and magnetic field correlated with the rf breakdowns using the FACET bunch parameters. The wakefields were calculated by a frequency domain method using periodic eigensolutions. Such a method takes into account wall losses and is applicable to a large variety of geometries. The maximum achieved accelerating gradient is 0.3  GV/m with a peak surface electric field of 1.5  GV/m and a pulse length of about 2.4 ns.",1

Scalar and fermionic models are used for D = 1 + 3 (films), D = 1 + 2 (hollow cylinder) and D = 1 + 1 (ring). For all models, a minimal length is found, below which no thermally-induced phase transition occurs. Using quasiperiodic boundary condition controlled by a contour parameter 𝜃 (𝜃 = 0 is a periodic boundary condition and 𝜃 = 1 is an antiperiodic condition), it results that the minimal length depends directly on the value of 𝜃. It is also argued that this parameter can be associated to an Aharonov–Bohm phase.",1

This may improve our measurement of the total energy released in neutrinos and also the orientation of the supernova-pulsar system.",1
132734,2,"On causality violation on a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime The causal properties of the family of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes are analyzed and compared to those of the Kerr family. At first we show that a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime can be viewed as an assembly of Carter's blocks i.e. four dimensional spacetime regions contained within Killing horizons or a Killing horizon and the asymptotic de Sitter region. From this perspective and leaving aside topological identifications, the causal properties of a Kerr de Sitter spacetime are determined by the causal properties of the individual Carter's blocks viewed as spacetimes in their own right. We show that any Carter's block is stably causal except for the blocks that contain the ring singularity. The latter are vicious sets: any two events within such block can be connected by a future (respectively past) directed timelike curve. This behavior is identical to the causal behavior of the Boyer-Lindquist blocks that contains the Kerr ring singularity which are also vicious sets. On the other hand, while for the case of a naked Kerr singularity the entire spacetime is a vicious set and thus closed timelike curves pass through any event including events lying in the asymptotic region, for the case of a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime the cosmological horizons imply that the asymptotic de Sitter region is causally well behaved. In that regard a positive cosmological constant appears to improve the causal behavior of the underlying spacetime.",1
132776,2,"Field induced phase transition in the few photon regime Some features of the field induced phase transition accompanied by the vacuum creation of an electron-positron plasma (EPP) in strong time-dependent electric fields have been discussed in the work [1] in the domain of the tunneling mechanism (ω ≪ m, where ω is the characteristic frequency of the external field and m is the electron mass). In the present contribution the features of this process will be considered in the few photon domain where ω ~ m. We observe a narrowing of the transient domain of the quickly oscillations and, mainly, a considerable growth of the effectiveness of the EPP production. Under these circumstances, we see an increase of the effectiveness of the EPP creation in the particular case of a bifrequent excitation, where both mechanisms (tunneling and few photon) act simultaneously [2, 3].",1
132832,2,"Constraining Primordial Black Holes with the EDGES 21-cm Absorption Signal The EDGES experiment has recently measured an anomalous global 21-cm spectrum due to hydrogen absorptions at redshifts of about $z\sim 17$. Model independently, the unusually low temperature of baryons probed by this observable sets strong constraints on any physical process that transfers energy into the baryonic environment at such redshifts. Here we make use of the 21-cm spectrum to derive bounds on the energy injection due to a possible population of ${\cal O}(1-100) M_\odot$ primordial black holes, which induce a wide spectrum of radiation during the accretion of the surrounding gas. After calculating the total radiative intensity of a primordial black hole population, we estimate the amount of heat and ionisations produced in the baryonic gas and compute the resulting thermal history of the Universe with a modified version of RECFAST code. Finally, by imposing that the temperature of the gas at $z\sim 17$ does not exceed the indications of EDGES, we constrain the possible abundance of primordial black holes. Depending on uncertainties related to the accretion model, we find that ${\cal O}(10) M_\odot$ primordial black holes can only contribute to a fraction $f_{\rm PBH}<(1-10^{-2})$ of the total dark matter abundance.",1

132957,2,"Cosmology with the Square Kilometre Array by SKA-Japan In the past several decades, the standard cosmological model has been established and its parameters have been measured to a high precision, while there are still many fundamental questions in cosmology; such as the physics in the very early universe, the origin of the cosmic acceleration, and the nature of dark matter. The forthcoming radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which will be the world's largest, will be able to open a new frontier in cosmology and will be one of the most powerful tools for cosmology in the coming decade. The cosmological surveys conducted by the SKA would have the potential not only to answer these fundamental questions but also deliver precision cosmology. In this article we briefly review the role of the SKA from the viewpoint of modern cosmology. The cosmological science led by the SKA-Japan Consortium (SKA-JP) Cosmology Science Working Group is also discussed.",1
132958,2,"Lagrangian formulation of the general relativistic Poynting-Robertson effect We propose the Lagrangian formulation for describing the motion of a test particle in a general relativistic, stationary, and axially symmetric spacetime. The test particle is also affected by a radiation field, modeled as a coherent flux of photons traveling along the null geodesics of the background spacetime, including the general relativistic Poynting-Robertson effect. The innovative part of this work is to prove the existence of the potential linked to the dissipative action caused by the Poynting-Robertson effect in general relativity through the help of an integrating factor, depending on the energy of the system. Generally, such kinds of inverse problems involving dissipative effects might not admit a Lagrangian formulation; especially, in general relativity, there are no examples of such attempts in the literature so far. We reduce this general relativistic Lagrangian formulation to the classic case in the weak-field limit. This approach facilitates further studies in improving the treatment of the radiation field, and it contains, for example, some implications for a deeper comprehension of the gravitational waves.",1
133066,2,"Evolution of the Building Management System in the INFN CNAF Tier-1 data center facility. The INFN CNAF Tier-1 data center is composed by two different main rooms containing IT resources and four additional locations that hosts the necessary technology infrastructures providing the electrical power and cooling to the facility. The power supply and continuity are ensured by a dedicated room with three 15,000 to 400 V transformers in a separate part of the principal building and two redundant 1.4MW diesel rotary uninterruptible power supplies. The cooling is provided by six free cooling chillers of 320 kW each with a N+2 redundancy configuration. Clearly, considering the complex physical distribution of the technical plants, a detailed Building Management System (BMS) was designed and implemented as part of the original project in order to monitor and collect all the necessary information and for providing alarms in case of malfunctions or major failures. After almost 10 years of service, a revision of the BMS system was somewhat necessary. In addition, the increasing cost of electrical power is nowadays a strong motivation for improving the energy efficiency of the infrastructure. Therefore the exact calculation of the power usage effectiveness (PUE) metric has become one of the most important factors when aiming for the optimization of a modern data center. For these reasons, an evolution of the BMS system was designed using the Schneider StruxureWare infrastructure hardware and software products. This solution proves to be a natural and flexible development of the previous TAC Vista software with advantages in the ease of use and the possibility to customize the data collection and the graphical interfaces display. Moreover, the addition of protocols like open standard Web services gives the possibility to communicate with the BMS from custom user application and permits the exchange of data and information through the Web between different third-party systems. Specific Web services SOAP requests has been implemented in our Tier-1 monitoring system in order to collect historical trends of power demands and calculate the partial PUE (pPUE) of a specific part of the infrastructure. This would help in the identification of “spots” that may need further energy optimization. The StruxureWare system maintains compatibility with standard protocols like Modbus as well as native LonWorks, making possible reusing the existing network between physical locations as well as a considerable number of programmable controller and I/O modules that interact with the facility. The high increase of detailed statistical information about power consumption and the HVAC (heat, ventilation and air conditioning) parameters could prove to be a very valuable strategic choice for improving the overall PUE. This will bring remarkable benefits for the overall management costs, despite the limits of the non-optimal actual location of the facility, and it will help us in the process of making a more energy efficient data center that embraces the concept of green IT.",1

Based on the observational data, we obtain bounds on the characteristic length and scaling dimension of the UG model.

133117,2,"Strong Gravitational Lensing by a Charged Kiselev Black Hole We study the gravitational lensing scenario where the lens is a spherically symmetric charged black hole (BH) surrounded by quintessence matter. The null geodesic equations in the curved background of the black hole are derived. The resulting trajectory equation is solved analytically via perturbation and series methods for a special choice of parameters, and the distance of the closest approach to black hole is calculated. We also derive the lens equation giving the bending angle of light in the curved background. In the strong field approximation, the solution of the lens equation is also obtained for all values of the quintessence parameter $w_q$ . For all $w_q$ , we show that there are no stable closed null orbits and that corrections to the deflection angle for the Reissner–Nordström black hole when the observer and the source are at large, but finite, distances from the lens do not depend on the charge up to the inverse of the distances squared.

133192,2,"Measurements of the Temperature and E-Mode Polarization of the CMB from 500 Square Degrees of SPTpol Data We present measurements of the E-mode polarization angular auto-power spectrum (EE) and temperature–E-mode cross-power spectrum (TE) of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using 150 GHz data from three seasons of SPTpol observations. We report the power spectra over the spherical harmonic multipole range and detect nine acoustic peaks in the EE spectrum with high signal-to-noise ratio. These measurements are the most sensitive to date of the EE and TE power spectra at and , respectively. The observations cover 500 , a fivefold increase in area compared to previous SPTpol analyses, which increases our sensitivity to the photon diffusion damping tail of the CMB power spectra enabling tighter constraints on ΛCDM model extensions. After masking all sources with unpolarized flux mJy, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on residual polarized point-source power of at , suggesting that the EE damping tail dominates foregrounds to at least with modest source masking. We find that the SPTpol data set is in mild tension with the ΛCDM model (), and different data splits prefer parameter values that differ at the level.

133271,2,"Supersymmetry in Closed Chains of Coupled Majorana Modes We consider a closed chain of an even number of Majorana zero modes with nearest-neighbor couplings which are different site by site generically, thus having no crystal symmetry. Instead, we demonstrate the possibility of an emergent supersymmetry (SUSY), which is accompanied by gapless fermionic excitations. In particular, the condition can be easily satisfied by tuning only one coupling, regardless of how many other couplings are there. Such a system can be realized by four Majorana modes on two parallel Majorana nanowires with their ends connected by Josephson junctions and their bodies connected by an external superconducting ring. By tuning the Josephson couplings with a magnetic flux Φ through the ring, we get the gapless excitations at ΦSUSY=±fΦ0 with Φ0=hc/2e, which is signaled by a zero-bias conductance peak in tunneling conductance. We find this f generally a fractional number and oscillating with increasing Zeeman fields that parallel to the nanowires, which provide a unique experimental signature for the existence of Majorana modes.",1

One ties invariant fields with the notion of normal form, the second allows comparison of different invariant fields and the two others tie the existence of invariant fields to the existence of certain invariant sets. We explain how the theorems apply to the spin dynamics of spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles.

This extends the usual Noether's correspondence between global symmetries and conservation laws to the case of lower-degree conservation laws and not necessarily variational equations of motion. Finally, we equip the space of conservation laws of a given degree with a Lie bracket and establish a homomorphism of the resulting Lie algebra to the Lie algebra of global symmetries.",1

All the so obtained solutions, verify the energy conditions for a wide range of values of the parameters, and match smoothly to some exterior solution of the Weyl family, thereby representing globally regular models describing non-spherical sources of gravitational field. In the spherically symmetric limit, all our models converge to the well known incompressible perfect fluid solution. The key stone of our approach is based on an ansatz allowing to define the interior metric in terms of the exterior metric functions evaluated at the boundary source. Some particular sources are obtained, and the physical variables of the energy–momentum tensor are calculated explicitly, as well as the geometry of the source in terms of the relativistic multipole moments. The total mass of different configurations is also calculated, it is shown to be equal to the monopole of the exterior solution.",1

133610,2,"Imprint of thawing scalar fields on the large scale galaxy overdensity We investigate the observed galaxy power spectrum for the thawing class of scalar field models taking into account various general relativistic corrections that occur on very large scales. We consider the full general relativistic perturbation equations for the matter as well as the dark energy fluid. We form a single autonomous system of equations containing both the background and the perturbed equations of motion which we subsequently solve for different scalar field potentials. First we study the percentage deviation from the ΛCDM model for different cosmological parameters as well as in the observed galaxy power spectra on different scales in scalar field models for various choices of scalar field potentials. Interestingly the difference in background expansion results from the enhancement of power from ΛCDM on small scales, whereas the inclusion of general relativistic (GR) corrections results in the suppression of power from ΛCDM on large scales. This can be useful to distinguish scalar field models from ΛCDM with future optical/radio surveys. We also compare the observed galaxy power spectra for tracking and thawing types of scalar field using some particular choices for the scalar field potentials. We show that thawing and tracking models can have large differences in observed galaxy power spectra on large scales and for smaller redshifts due to different GR effects. But on smaller scales and for larger redshifts, the difference is small and is mainly due to the difference in background expansion.",1

In this article, an expression for the quantum noise in the angular motion measurement is explicitly derived. The expression indicates that one quadrature of the vacuum field of the first-order Hermite-Gaussian mode of light causes quantum sensing noise and the other causes quantum back-action noise, or in other words the first-order vacuum field is ponderomotively squeezed. It is also shown that the Gouy phase shift the light acquires between the mirror and the position of detection of the light corresponds to the homodyne angle. Therefore, the quantum back-action noise can be canceled and the standard quantum limit can be surpassed by choosing the appropriate position of detection analogously to the cancellation of quantum radiation pressure noise by choosing an appropriate homodyne angle.",1

We use deformable families of modules to efficiently compute $(1, 1)$-tangle invariants colored with projective modules of $\overline{U}_q^H(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. These relate to the colored Alexander tangle invariants studied in [ADO, M1].

133888,2,"Short range correlations and the isospin dependence of nuclear correlation functions Pair densities and associated correlation functions provide a critical tool for introducing many-body correlations into a wide-range of effective theories. Ab initio calculations show that two-nucleon pair-densities exhibit strong spin and isospin dependence. However, such calculations are not available for all nuclei of current interest. We therefore provide a simple model, which involves combining the short and long separation distance behavior using a single blending function, to accurately describe the two-nucleon correlations inherent in existing ab initio calculations. We show that the salient features of the correlation function arise from the features of the two-body short-range nuclear interaction, and that the suppression of the pp and nn pair-densities caused by the Pauli principle is important. Our procedure for obtaining pair-density functions and correlation functions can be applied to heavy nuclei which lack ab initio calculations.",1
134105,2,"New outburst of the symbiotic nova AG Pegasi after 165 yr Context. AG Peg is known as the slowest symbiotic nova, which experienced its nova-like outburst around 1850. After 165 yr, during June of 2015, it erupted again showing characteristics of the Z And-type outburst. Aims. The primary objective is to determine basic characteristics, the nature and type of the 2015 outburst of AG Peg. Methods. We achieved this aim by modelling the spectral energy distribution using low-resolution spectroscopy (330–750 nm; R = 500–1000), medium-resolution spectroscopy (420–720 nm; R ~ 11 000), and UBVRCIC photometry covering the 2015 outburst with a high cadence. Optical observations were complemented with the archival HST and FUSE spectra from the preceding quiescence. Results. During the outburst, the luminosity of the hot component was in the range of 2–11 × 1037 (d/ 0.8 kpc)2 erg s-1, being in correlation with the light curve (LC) profile. To generate the maximum luminosity by the hydrogen burning, the white dwarf (WD) had to accrete at ~ 3 × 10-7 M⊙ yr-1, which exceeds the stable-burning limit and thus led to blowing optically thick wind from the WD. We determined its mass-loss rate to a few × 10-6 M⊙ yr-1. At the high temperature of the ionising source, 1.5–2.3 × 105 K, the wind converted a fraction of the WD’s photospheric radiation into the nebular emission that dominated the optical. A one order of magnitude increase of the emission measure, from a few × 1059 (d/ 0.8 kpc)2 cm-3 during quiescence, to a few × 1060 (d/ 0.8 kpc)2 cm-3 during the outburst, caused a 2 mag brightening in the LC, which is classified as the Z And-type of the outburst. Conclusions. The very high nebular emission and the presence of a disk-like H i region encompassing the WD, as indicated by a significant broadening and high flux of the Raman-scattered O vi 6825 Å line during the outburst, is consistent with the ionisation structure of hot components in symbiotic stars during active phases.

134193,2,"Light-Ring Stability for Ultracompact Objects We prove the following theorem: axisymmetric, stationary solutions of the Einstein field equations formed from classical gravitational collapse of matter obeying the null energy condition, that are everywhere smooth and ultracompact (i.e., they have a light ring) must have at least two light rings, and one of them is stable. It has been argued that stable light rings generally lead to nonlinear spacetime instabilities. Our result implies that smooth, physically and dynamically reasonable ultracompact objects are not viable as observational alternatives to black holes whenever these instabilities occur on astrophysically short time scales. The proof of the theorem has two parts: (i) We show that light rings always come in pairs, one being a saddle point and the other a local extremum of an effective potential. This result follows from a topological argument based on the Brouwer degree of a continuous map, with no assumptions on the spacetime dynamics, and, hence, it is applicable to any metric gravity theory where photons follow null geodesics. (ii) Assuming Einstein’s equations, we show that the extremum is a local minimum of the potential (i.e., a stable light ring) if the energy-momentum tensor satisfies the null energy condition.",1
134200,2,"Capacity of entanglement and the distribution of density matrix eigenvalues in gapless systems We propose that the properties of the capacity of entanglement (COE) in gapless systems can efficiently be investigated through the use of the distribution of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (RDM). The COE is defined as the fictitious heat capacity calculated from the entanglement spectrum. Its dependence on the fictitious temperature can reflect the low-temperature behavior of the physical heat capacity and thus provide a useful probe of gapless bulk or edge excitations of the system. Assuming a power-law scaling of the COE with an exponent α at low fictitious temperatures, we derive an analytical formula for the distribution function of the RDM eigenvalues. We numerically test the effectiveness of the formula in a relativistic free scalar boson in two spatial dimensions and find that the distribution function can detect the expected α=3 scaling of the COE much more efficiently than the raw data of the COE. We also calculate the distribution function in the ground state of the half-filled Landau level with short-range interactions and find better agreement with the α=2/3 formula than with the α=1 one, which indicates a non-Fermi-liquid nature of the system.",1

The 1D Toda hierarchy and the Ablowitz–Ladik (aka relativistic Toda) hierarchy can be derived from the 2D Toda hierarchy as reductions. These integrable hierarchies have been applied to various problems of mathematics and mathematical physics since 1990s. A recent example is a series of studies on models of statistical mechanics called the melting crystal model. This research has revealed that the aforementioned two reductions of the 2D Toda hierarchy underlie two different melting crystal models. Technical clues are a fermionic realization of the quantum torus algebra, special algebraic relations therein called shift symmetries, and a matrix factorization problem. The two melting crystal models thus exhibit remarkable similarity with the Hermitian and unitary matrix models for which the two reductions of the 2D Toda hierarchy play the role of fundamental integrable structures.",1

In relativistic quantum mechanics this problem allows also to highlight the implications of special relativity for quantum physics, namely the effect that spin has on the quantised energy spectra. To illustrate this point, we solve the problem of a spin zero relativistic particle in a one- and three-dimensional box using the Klein–Gordon equation in the Feshbach–Villars formalism. We compare the solutions and the energy spectra obtained with the corresponding ones from the Dirac equation for a spin one-half relativistic particle. We note the similarities and differences, in particular the spin effects in the relativistic energy spectrum. As expected, the non-relativistic limit is the same for both kinds of particles, since, for a particle in a box, the spin contribution to the energy is a relativistic effect.",1

134330,2,"On the Non-Relativistic Groundstate Energy of Positronium in Relativistic Schroedinger Theory The \emph{Relativistic Schr\""odinger Theory} (RST) has been set up as an alternative form of particle theory. This theory obeys the fundamental symmetries which are required to hold for any meaningful theory: gauge and Lorentz covariance (RST can be formulated even over a pseudo-Riemannian space-time). But the question is now whether obeying those fundamental symmetries is sufficient for the practical success of a theory, i.e. whether the predictions are in agreement with the experimental findings. In this context, the non-relativistic energy spectrum of positronium has been considered in some precedent papers. Here, the problem is that exact solutions of the RST eigenvalue system cannot be obtained and one has to resort to approximate solutions. For this purpose, a variational method is applied in the present paper which yields the RST groundstate energy smaller than the former results and than its conventional counterpart by some 10\%. Such deviations are also observed when one compares the approximate RST spectrum (up to quantum numbers $n\approx 100$) to the corresponding predictions of the conventional theory. It seems presently not possible to decide whether those deviations are due to RST itself or are merely due to the applied approximation technique. Thus the practical usefulness of RST must remain unclarified for the moment.",1

Bring (1736 - 98) made important contributions to algebraic equations and obtained the canonical form x^5+px+q = 0 for quintics before Jerrard, Ruffini and Abel.

134351,2,"Weak quadrupole moments We introduce the weak quadrupole moment (WQM) of nuclei, related to the quadrupole distribution of the weak charge in the nucleus. The WQM produces a tensor weak interaction between the nucleus and electrons and can be observed in atomic and molecular experiments measuring parity nonconservation. The dominating contribution to the weak quadrupole is given by the quadrupole moment of the neutron distribution, therefore, corresponding experiments should allow one to measure the neutron quadrupoles. Using the deformed oscillator model and the Schmidt model we calculate the quadrupole distributions of neutrons, Q n , the WQMs, , and the Lorentz invariance violating energy shifts in 9Be, 21Ne, 27Al, 131Xe, 133Cs, 151Eu, 153Eu, 163Dy, 167Er, 173Yb, 177Hf, 179Hf, 181Ta, 201Hg and 229Th.",1
134366,2,"Blazar Jets Perturbed by Magneto-Gravitational Stresses in Supermassive Binaries We study particle acceleration and radiative processes in blazar jets under recurring conditions set by gravitational perturbations in supermassive binary systems. We consider the action from a companion orbiting a primary black hole of $\sim {10}^{8}\,{M}_{\odot }$, and perturbing its relativistic jet. We discuss how such conditions induce repetitive magneto-hydrodynamic stresses along the jet, and affect its inner electron acceleration and radiative processes. Specifically, we study how macroscopic perturbations related to increased jet “magnetization” end up in higher radiative outputs in the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. We first find an increase in magnetic field strength, as gauged in the optical band from the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in kinetic processes stimulated by reconnecting magnetic lines. The energetic electrons then proceed to up-scatter the synchrotron photons to GeV energies after the canonical synchrotron self-Compton radiation process. Our model implies a specific recurring pattern in the optical to gamma-ray emissions, made of high peaks and wide troughs. Progressing accelerations caused by spreading reconnections will produce an additional synchrotron keV component. Such outbursts provide a diagnostics for enhanced acceleration of electrons, which can up-scatter photons into the TeV range. We discuss how our model applies to the BL Lac object PG 1553+113, arguably the best candidate to now for high amplitude, recurring modulations in its gamma-ray emissions. We also consider other BL Lacs showing correlated keV–TeV radiations such as Mrk 421.",1
134442,2,"Controlling $T_c$ of Iridium films using interfacial proximity effects High precision calorimetry using superconducting transition edge sensors requires the use of superconducting films with a suitable $T_c$, depending on the application. To advance high-precision macrocalorimetry, we require low-$T_c$ films that are easy to fabricate. A simple and effective way to suppress $T_c$ of superconducting Iridium through the proximity effect is demonstrated by using Ir/Pt bilayers as well as Au/Ir/Au trilayers. While Ir/Au films fabricated by applying heat to the substrate during Ir deposition have been used in the past for superconducting sensors, we present results of $T_c$ suppression on Iridium by deposition at room temperature in Au/Ir/Au trilayers and Ir/Pt bilayers in the range of $\sim$20-100~mK. Measurements of the relative impedance between the Ir/Pt bilayers and Au/Ir/Au trilayers fabricated show factor of $\sim$10 higher values in the Ir/Pt case. These new films could play a key role in the development of scalable superconducting transition edge sensors that require low-$T_c$ films to minimize heat capacity and maximize energy resolution, while keeping high-yield fabrication methods.",1

134522,2,"Electronic properties of curved few-layers graphene: a geometrical approach We show the presence of non-relativistic L\'evy-Leblond fermions in flat three- and four-layers graphene with AB stacking, extending the results obtained in [Curvatronics2017] for bilayer graphene. When the layer is curved we obtain a set of equations for Galilean fermions that are a variation of those of L\'evy-Leblond with a well defined combination of pseudospin, and that admit L\'evy-Leblond spinors as solutions in an approriate limit. The local energy of such Galilean fermions is sensitive to the intrinsic curvature of the surface. We discuss the relationship between two-dimensional pseudospin, labelling layer degrees of freedom, and the different energy bands. For L\'evy-Leblond fermions an interpretation is given in terms of massless fermions in an effective 4D spacetime, and in this case the pseudospin is related to four dimensional chirality. A non-zero energy band gap between conduction and valence electronic bands is obtained for surfaces with positive curvature.",1
134573,2,"Relativistic mass and spin of a Kerr black hole in terms of observations In this paper, we derive closed formulas for the mass $M$ and the spin parameter $a=J/M$ (here $J$ is the black hole angular momentum in natural units) of a Kerr black hole in terms of a minimal quantity of observational data, namely, the red-/blueshifts of photons emitted by massive particles (stars or gas) moving on geodesics around the black hole and their respective orbital radius. It turns out that given a set of two (three) stars revolving around the Kerr black hole, the aforementioned formulas involve just eight (twelve) observational data.",1
134587,2,"On the fate of Birkhoff’s theorem in Shape Dynamics Spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat solutions of Shape Dynamics were previously studied assuming standard falloff conditions for the metric and the momenta. These ensure that the spacetime is asymptotically Minkowski, and that the falloff conditions are Poincaré-invariant. These assumptions however are not legitimate in Shape Dynamics, which does not make assumptions on the structure or regularity of spacetime. Analyzing the same problem in full generality, I find that the system is underdetermined, as there is one function of time that is not fixed by any condition and appears to have physical relevance. This quantity can be fixed only by studying more realistic models coupled with matter, and it turns out to be related to the dilatational momentum of the matter surrounding the region under study.",1
134665,2,"Triton binding energy and neutron-deuteron scattering up to next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory Determination of the proper power-counting scheme is an important issue for the systematic application of Chiral Effective Field Theory in nuclear physics. We analyze the cutoff dependence of three-nucleon observables (the neutron-deuteron scattering lengths and the triton binding energy) at the leading and next-to-leading orders of a power counting that ensures order-by-order renormalization in the two-nucleon system. Our results confirm that, as usually assumed in the literature, three-body forces are not needed for renormalization of the three-nucleon system up to next-to-leading order.",1
134685,2,"Elliptic Flow and the Nuclear Equation of State New constraints for the nuclear equation of state at suprasaturation densities have been obtained by measuring collective particle flows in heavy-ion reactions at relativistic energies. Ratios and differences of neutron and hydrogen flows in 197Au + 197Au collisions at 400 MeV/nucleon were used in studies of the asymmetric-matter equation of state. The comparison with predictions of transport models favors a moderately soft to linear density dependence, consistent with ab-initio nuclear matter theories. Model predictions suggest that comprehensive data sets collected at higher bombarding energies will provide information on the asymmetric-matter equation of state in the density range up to two or three times the saturation value.",1
134704,2,"First Determination of the Level Structure of an $sd$-Shell Hypernucleus, $\rm {^{19}_{\Lambda}F}$ We report on the first observation of γ rays emitted from an sd-shell hypernucleus, FΛ19. The energy spacing between the ground state doublet, 1/2+ and 3/2+ states, of FΛ19 is determined to be 315.5±0.4(stat)-0.5+0.6(syst)  keV by measuring the γ-ray energy of the M1(3/2+→1/2+) transition. In addition, three γ-ray peaks are observed and assigned as E2(5/2+→1/2+), E1(1/2-→1/2+), and E1(1/2-→3/2+) transitions. The excitation energies of the 5/2+ and 1/2- states are determined to be 895.2±0.3(stat)±0.5(syst) and 1265.6±1.2(stat)-0.5+0.7(syst)  keV, respectively.

134724,2,"Low Emittance Growth In a LEBT With Un-Neutralized Section In a Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT), the emittance growth due to the beam's own space charge is typically suppressed by way of neutralization from either electrons or ions, which originate from ionization of the background gas. In cases where the beam is chopped, the neutralization pattern changes throughout the beginning of the pulse, causing the Twiss parameters to differ significantly from their steady state values, which, in turn, may result in beam losses downstream. For a modest beam perveance, there is an alternative solution, in which the beam is kept un-neutralized in the portion of the LEBT that contains the chopper. The emittance can be nearly preserved if the transition to the un-neutralized section occurs where the beam exhibits low transverse tails. This report discusses the experimental realization of such a scheme at Fermilab's PXIE, where low beam emittance dilution was demonstrated.",1
134750,2,"Novel self-similar rotating solutions of nonideal transverse magnetohydrodynamics The evolution of electromagnetic and thermodynamic fields in a nonideal fluid is studied in the framework of ultrarelativistic transverse magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which is essentially characterized by electric and magnetic fields being transverse to the fluid velocity and translational invariance in the transverse plane. Extending the method of self-similar solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics to the case of nonconserved charges, the differential equations of nonideal transverse MHD are solved, and two novel sets of self-similar solutions are derived. The first set turns out to be a boost-invariant and exact solution, which is characterized by nonrotating electric and magnetic fields. The second set is a nonboost-invariant solution, which is characterized by rotating electric and magnetic fields. The rotation occurs with increasing rapidity η, as the angular velocity is defined by ω0≡∂ζ∂η=∂ϕ∂η, with ζ and ϕ being the angles of local electric and magnetic vectors with respect to a certain fixed axis in the transverse plane. For both sets of solutions, the electric and magnetic fields are either parallel or antiparallel to each other in the local rest frame of the fluid. Performing a complete numerical analysis, the effects of finite electric conductivity as well as electric and magnetic susceptibilities of the medium on the evolution of rotating and nonrotating MHD solutions are explored, and the interplay between the angular velocity ω0 and these quantities is scrutinized. The lifetime of electromagnetic fields and the evolution of the temperature of the electromagnetized fluid are shown to be affected by ω0.",1
134888,2,"Coherent synchrotron radiation by electrons moving on circular orbits We study coherent synchrotron radiation by electrons in the Frenet-Serret coordinate system with a constant curvature 1/ρ. Based on the Hamiltonian in the Courant-Synder theory of particle accelerators, we find in general that the transverse force is essentially the Lorentz force but with a substitution of the transverse magnetic field Bx,y→(1+x/ρ)Bx,y, where x and y are the transverse positions. The curvature term provides us a key to derive the point-charge wakefield explicitly in terms of the incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, resulting in a steady-state theory of the coherent synchrotron radiation in two-dimensional free space.",1
134913,2,"Theory of the disordered $\nu = \frac{5}{2}$ quantum thermal Hall state: Emergent symmetry and phase diagram Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) system at Landau level filling fraction ν=5/2 has long been suggested to be non-Abelian, either Pfaffian (Pf) or antiPfaffian (APf) states by numerical studies, both with quantized Hall conductance σxy=5e2/2h. Thermal Hall conductances of the Pf and APf states are quantized at κxy=7/2 and κxy=3/2, respectively, in a proper unit. However, a recent experiment shows the thermal Hall conductance of ν=5/2 FQH state is κxy=5/2. It has been speculated that the system contains random Pf and APf domains driven by disorders, and the neutral chiral Majorana modes on the domain walls may undergo a percolation transition to a κxy=5/2 phase. In this paper, we do perturbative and nonperturbative analyses on the domain walls between Pf and APf. We show the domain wall theory possesses an emergent SO(4) symmetry at energy scales below a threshold Λ1, which is lowered to an emergent U(1)×U(1) symmetry at energy scales between Λ1 and a higher value Λ2, and is finally lowered to the composite fermion parity symmetry Z2F above Λ2. Based on the emergent symmetries, we propose a phase diagram of the disordered ν=5/2 FQH system and show that a κxy=5/2 phase arises at disorder energy scales Λ>Λ1. Furthermore, we show the gapped double-semion sector of ND compact domain walls contributes nonlocal topological degeneracy 2ND−1, causing a low-temperature peak in the heat capacity. We implement a nonperturbative method to bootstrap generic topological 1+1D domain walls (two-surface defects) applicable to any 2+1D non-Abelian topological order. We also identify potentially relevant spin topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) for various ν=5/2 FQH states in terms of fermionic version of U(1)±8 Chern-Simons theory×Z8-class TQFTs.",1
134933,2,"Neutron Detector Based on Polystyrene and Cadmium Layers There is description of the development of detectors for neutrons, based on polystyrene and cadmium layers. Cadmium is used as neutron’s converters via reaction (n,γ) and polystyrene is used as scintillation material to register the originated gamma quanta. The simulation and experimental investigations of proposed detectors design are presented. The main advantages of proposed detection are short measurement time - approximately 5 µsec. It is shown that the principle, suggested in the models, can be applied to the detection of neutrons from a pulsed neutron source, for example, secondary neutrons, generated by hadron showers in the space environment or by high-intensity pulsed sources based on accelerators. Detection efficiency for the 24*20 cm(2) size detector model, measured during the experiment and simulated by the Monte Carlo technique is about 1% with the measurement time being approximately 5 µsec",1
134957,2,"Particle acceleration with beam driven wakefield Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) or laser wakefield accelerators (LWFA) are new technologies of particle accelerators that are particularly promising, as they can provide accelerating fields of hundreds of Gigaelectronvolts per meter while conventional facilities are limited to hundreds of Megaelectronvolts per meter. In the Plasma Wakefield Acceleration scheme (PWFA) and the Laser Wakefield Acceleration scheme (LWFA), a bunch of particles or a laser pulse propagates in a gas, creating an accelerating structure in its wake: an electron density wake associated to electromagnetic fields in the plasma. The main achievement of this thesis is the very first demonstration and experimental study in 2016 of the Plasma Wakefield Acceleration of a distinct positron bunch. In the scheme considered in the experiment, a lithium plasma was created in an oven, and a plasma density wave was excited inside it by a first bunch of positrons (the drive bunch) while the energy deposited in the plasma was extracted by a second bunch (the trailing bunch). An accelerating field of 1.36 GeV/m was reached during the experiment, for a typical accelerated charge of 40 pC. In the present manuscript is also reported the feasibility of several regimes of acceleration, which opens promising prospects for plasma wakefield accelerator staging and future colliders. Furthermore, this thesis also reports the progresses made regarding a new scheme: the use of a LWFA-produced electron beam to drive plasma waves in a gas jet. In this second experimental study, an electron beam created by laser-plasma interaction is refocused by particle bunch-plasma interaction in a second gas jet. A study of the physical phenomena associated to this hybrid LWFA-PWFA platform is reported. Last, the hybrid LWFA-PWFA scheme is also promising in order to enhance the X-ray emission by the LWFA electron beam produced in the first stage of the platform. In the last chapter of this thesis is reported the first experimental realization of this last scheme, and its promising results are discussed.",1
134964,2,"Passive Focusing of Intense Ion Beams The radial control of high current ion beams from induction accelerators or generated by short pulsed intense laser-plasma interactions is generally limited by Coulomb repulsion of the ion beam. In this dissertation, we investigate a novel focusing technique for the radial control of intense ion beams. The concept envisions using a stack of thin, closely spaced conducting foils to mitigate defocusing self-electric forces to enable self-magnetic forces to focus. The ion beam must be energetic enough to penetrate the stack of foils with limited beam degradation from scattering and energy loss. We study beam focusing and scattering and find constraints on the design and performance of such a passive lens. We further investigate the effects of secondary electrons generated by the impact of ions on foils and show the importance of secondary electrons whose velocity is higher than the ion beam velocity. In this case, current neutralization could exceed charge neutralization, i.e., the self-magnetic focusing would be reduced more than the self-electric defocusing, producing a net defocusing force on the ion beam. A statistical envelope model is developed and its predictions are compared to those of the PIC simulation code WARP. An ion beam focused by the stack of thin foils may have potential applications to research fields requiring intense beams, e.g., nuclear fusion, tumor therapy or high energy density laboratory physics. We provide in the appendix an analysis of the expansion of a thin foil heated to the warm dense matter (WDM) regime which can be reached by such beams.",1
135014,2,"Research on Fault Diagnosis of Power Supply Control System on BEPCII The reliable and stable operation of the accelerator is the premise and foundation of physics experiments. For example, in the BEPCII, the fault of the magnet power supply front-end electronics devices may cause accelerator energy instability and even lead to beam loss. Therefore, it is very necessary to diagnose and locate the device fault accurately and rapidly, that will induce the high cost of the accelerator operation. Faults diagnosis can not only improve the safety and reliability of the equipment, but also effectively reduce the equipment's cycle costing. The multi-signal flow model proposed by Pattipati K.R is considered as the preferred method of industrial equipment faults detection. However, there are still some problems about fault probability conflict in the processing of correlation matrix diagnosis due to the hierarchical nature of multi-signal flow modeling. Thus we develop the fault diagnosis strategy based on the important prior knowledge of the fault. This method is applied to the front-end electronic devices of BEPCII magnet power supply control system and improves the fault diagnosis and analysis ability of magnet power supply control system.",1

In addition, the two-level systems mutually interact via direct dipole–dipole interaction. We apply the model to an ensemble of dye molecules coupled to a plasmonic excitation in a metallic nanoparticle and study how the dipole–dipole interaction and configurational randomness introduced to the system affect the energy spectra. Comparing the system eigenenergies obtained by our model with the light spectra from a multiple-scattering simulation, we suggest a way to identify dark modes in our model.

135242,2,"Thermodynamic Volume Product in Spherically Symmetric and Axisymmetric Spacetime In this Letter, we have examined the thermodynamic volume products for spherically symmetric and axisymmetric spacetimes in the framework of \emph{extended phase space}. Such volume products usually formulated in terms of the outer horizon~(${\cal H}^{+}$) and the inner horizon~(${\cal H}^{-}$) of black hole ~ (BH) spacetime. Besides volume product, the other thermodynamic formulations like \emph{volume sum, volume minus and volume division} are considered for a wide variety of spherically symmetric spacetime and axisymmetric spacetimes. Like area~(or entropy) product of multihorizons, the mass-independent~(universal) feature of volume products are sometimes also \emph{fail}. In particular for a spherically symmetric AdS spacetimes the simple thermodynamic volume product of ${\cal H}^{\pm}$ is not mass-independent. In this case, more complicated combinations of outer and inner horizon volume products are indeed mass-independent. For a particular class of spherically symmetric cases i.e. Reissner Nordstr\""om BH of Einstein gravity and Kehagias-Sfetsos BH of Ho\v{r}ava Lifshitz gravity, the thermodynamic volume products of ${\cal H}^{\pm}$ is indeed \emph{universal}. For axisymmetric class of BH spacetime in Einstein gravity all the combinations are \emph{mass-dependent}. There has been no chance to formulate any combinations of volume product relation is to be mass-independent. Interestingly, \emph{only the rotating BTZ black hole} in 3D provides the volume product formula is mass-independent i.e. \emph{universal} and hence it is quantized.",1
