208,0,"Statistical Performance Analysis of the MUSIC Algorithm in Angular Sectors This article deals with the problem of the statistical performance analysis of the MUSIC ( Multiple Signal Classification ) algorithm which is an eigen decomposition based method for the estimation of the angles of arrival of signals received by an array of sensors. In past work the performance of the MUSIC algorithm was studied ( via an asymptotic statistical analysis of the null spectrum of the algorithm ) for the case of two plane waves of equal power in noise. In this article, a new theoretical formula is derived for the signal to noise ratio resolution threshold of two uncorrelated, narrow band plane waves with equal powers in angular sectors received by an array of sensors. The accuracy of the formula is assessed using examples which compute the theoretical signal to noise ratio resolution threshold and compare it with the threshold obtained from simulations.",1
234,0,"The higher order $q$-Dolan-Grady relations and quantum integrable systems In this thesis, the connection between recently introduced algebraic structures (tridiagonal algebra, $q$-Onsager algebra, generalized $q-$Onsager algebras), related representation theory (tridiagonal pair, Leonard pair, orthogonal polynomials), some properties of these algebras and the analysis of related quantum integrable models on the lattice (the $XXZ$ open spin chain at roots of unity) is first reviewed. Then, the main results of the thesis are described: (i) for the class of $q-$Onsager algebras associated with $\widehat{sl_2}$ and ADE type simply-laced affine Lie algebras, higher order analogs of Lusztig's relations are conjectured and proven in various cases, (ii) for the open $XXZ$ spin chain at roots of unity, new elements (that are divided polynomials of $q-$Onsager generators) are introduced and some of their properties are studied. These two elements together with the two basic elements of the $q-$Onsager algebra generate a new algebra, which can be understood as an analog of Lusztig's quantum group for the $q-$Onsager algebra. Some perspectives are presented.",1
287,0,"Technology advancement of the CCD201-20 EMCCD for the WFIRST coronagraph instrument: sensor characterization and radiation damage The Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope-Astrophysics Focused Telescope Asset (WFIRST-AFTA) mission is a 2.4-m class space telescope that will be used across a swath of astrophysical research domains. JPL will provide a high-contrast imaging coronagraph instrument - one of two major astronomical instruments. In order to achieve the low noise performance required to detect planets under extremely low flux conditions, the electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) has been baselined for both of the coronagraph's sensors - the imaging camera and integral field spectrograph. JPL has established an EMCCD test laboratory in order to advance EMCCD maturity to technology readiness level-6. This plan incorporates full sensor characterization, including read noise, dark current, and clock-induced charge. In addition, by considering the unique challenges of the WFIRST space environment, degradation to the sensor's charge transfer efficiency will be assessed, as a result of damage from high-energy particles such as protons, electrons, and cosmic rays. Science-grade CCD201-20 EMCCDs have been irradiated to a proton fluence that reflects the projected WFIRST orbit. Performance degradation due to radiation displacement damage is reported, which is the first such study for a CCD201-20 that replicates the WFIRST conditions. In addition, techniques intended to identify and mitigate radiation-induced electron trapping, such as trap pumping, custom clocking, and thermal cycling, are discussed.",1
439,0,"Path Integral approach to nonequilibrium potentials in multiplicative Langevin dynamics We present a path integral formalism to compute potentials for nonequilibrium steady states, reached by a multiplicative stochastic dynamics. We develop a weak-noise expansion, which allows the explicit evaluation of the potential in arbitrary dimensions and for any stochastic prescription. We apply this general formalism to study noise-induced phase transitions. We focus on a class of multiplicative stochastic lattice models and compute the steady state phase diagram in terms of the noise intensity and the lattice coupling. We obtain, under appropriate conditions, an ordered phase induced by noise. By computing entropy production, we show that microscopic irreversibility is a necessary condition to develop noise-induced phase transitions. This property of the nonequilibrium stationary state has no relation with the initial stages of the dynamical evolution, in contrast with previous interpretations, based on the short-time evolution of the order parameter.",1
481,0,"How does our choice of observable influence our estimation of the centre of a galaxy cluster? Insights from cosmological simulations Galaxy clusters are an established and powerful test-bed for theories of both galaxy evolution and cosmology. Accurate interpretation of cluster observations often requires robust identification of the location of the centre. Using a statistical sample of clusters drawn from a suite of cosmological simulations in which we have explored a range of galaxy formation models, we investigate how the location of this centre is affected by the choice of observable - stars, hot gas, or the full mass distribution as can be probed by the gravitational potential. We explore several measures of cluster centre: the minimum of the gravitational potential, which would expect to define the centre if the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium; the peak of the density; the centre of BCG; and the peak and centroid of X-ray luminosity. We find that the centre of BCG correlates more strongly with the minimum of the gravitational potential than the X-ray defined centres, while AGN feedback acts to significantly enhance the offset between the peak X-ray luminosity and minimum gravitational potential. These results highlight the importance of centre identification when interpreting clusters observations, in particular when comparing theoretical predictions and observational data.",1

We then give an application of these ideas to the study of Calabi-Yau threefolds admitting fibrations by lattice polarized K3 surfaces.",1
529,0,"Simulation of the vortex dynamics in a real pinning landscape of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ coated conductors The ability of high-temperature superconductors (HTSs) to carry very large currents with almost no dissipation makes them irreplaceable for high-power applications. The development and further improvement of HTS-based cables requires an in-depth understanding of the superconducting vortex dynamics in presence of complex pinning landscapes. We present a critical current analysis of a real HTS sample in a magnetic field by combining state-of-the-art large-scale Ginzburg-Landau simulations with reconstructive three-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy tomography of the pinning landscape in Dy-doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. This methodology provides a unique look at the vortex dynamics in the presence of a complex pinning landscape, responsible for the high current-carrying capacity characteristic of commercial HTS wires. Our method demonstrates very good functional and quantitative agreement of the critical current between simulation and experiment, providing a new predictive tool for HTS wires design.",1
670,0,"Classical realization of dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free optical coherence tomography Quantum-optical coherence tomography (Q-OCT) provides a dispersion-canceled axial-imaging method, but its practical use is limited by the weakness of the light source and by artifacts in the images. A recent study using chirped-pulse interferometry (CPI) has demonstrated dispersion-canceled and artifact-free OCT with a classical system; however, unwanted background signals still remain after removing the artifacts. Here, we propose a classical optical method that realizes dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free OCT. We employ a time-reversed system for Q-OCT with transform-limited input laser pulses to achieve dispersion-canceled OCT with a classical system. We have also introduced a subtraction method to remove artifacts and background signals. With these methods, we experimentally demonstrated dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and background-free axial imaging of a coverglass and cross-sectional imaging of the surface of a coin.",1
718,0,"The data processing pipeline for the Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer We present the data processing pipeline to generate calibrated data products from the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the Herschel Space Observatory. The pipeline processes telemetry from SPIRE observations and produces calibrated spectra for all resolution modes. The spectrometer pipeline shares some elements with the SPIRE photometer pipeline, including the conversion of telemetry packets into data timelines and calculation of bolometer voltages. We present the following fundamental processing steps unique to the spectrometer: temporal and spatial interpolation of the scan mechanism and detector data to create interferograms; Fourier transformation; apodization; and creation of a data cube. We also describe the corrections for various instrumental effects including first- and second-level glitch identification and removal, correction of the effects due to emission from the Herschel telescope and from within the spectrometer instrument, interferogram baseline correction, temporal and spatial phase correction, non-linear response of the bolometers, and variation of instrument performance across the focal plane arrays. Astronomical calibration is based on combinations of observations of standard astronomical sources and regions of space known to contain minimal emission.",1

757,0,"Control of Edge Currents at a Ferromagnet - Triplet Superconductor Interface by Multiple Helical Majorana Modes We study the spin and charge currents flowing at the interface of an itinerant ferromagnet with a topological spin-triplet superconductor having different number of time-reversal-invariant Majorana helical modes. Depending on the number of helical modes, the capacity of carrying spin and charge currents is shown to be directly related to the amplitude and orientation of the ferromagnetic magnetization with respect to the superconducting $\vec{d}$-vector. Differently from the one-helical mode spin-triplet superconductor, we find that the presence of a finite amount of electronic hybridization with the two pairs of Majorana helical modes leads to nonvanishing charge current independently of the ferromagnetic exchange. The competition between the two pairs of Majorana helical modes remarkably yields a spin-current response that is almost constant in the range of weak to intermediate ferromagnetism. The behavior of the spin current is tightly linked to the direction of the spin-polarization in the ferromagnet and tends to be flatten for a magnetization that is coplanar to the spin-triplet $\vec{d}$-vector independently of the number of helical modes.",1
802,0,"Universality and scaling in a charge two-channel Kondo device We study a charge two-channel Kondo model, demonstrating that recent experiments [Iftikhar et al, Nature 526, 233 (2015)] realize an essentially perfect quantum simulation -- not just of its universal physics, but also nonuniversal effects away from the scaling limit. Numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations yield conductance lineshapes encoding RG flow to a critical point involving a free Majorana fermion. By mimicking the experimental protocol, the experimental curve is reproduced quantitatively over 9 orders of magnitude, although we show that far greater bandwidth/temperature separation is required to obtain the universal result. Fermi liquid instabilities are also studied: In particular, our exact analytic results for non-linear conductance provide predictions away from thermal equilibrium, in the regime of existing experiments.",1
992,0,"Monodromy of the SL_2 Hitchin fibration We calculate the monodromy action on the mod 2 cohomology for SL(2,C) Hitchin systems and give an application of our results in terms of the moduli space of semistable SL(2,R) Higgs bundles.",1
1060,0,"Galaxy Formation with Local Photoionization Feedback -II. Effect of X-Ray Emission from Binaries and Hot Gas We study how X-rays from stellar binary systems and the hot intracluster medium (ICM) affect the radiative cooling rates of gas in galaxies. Our study uses a novel implementation of gas cooling in the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code \textsc{arepo}. X-rays from stellar binaries do not affect cooling at all as their emission spectrum is too hard to effectively couple with galactic gas. In contrast, X-rays from the ICM couple well with gas in the temperature range $10^4 - 10^6$ K. Idealised simulations show that the hot halo radiation field has minimal impact on the dynamics of cooling flows in clusters because of the high virial temperature ($&gt; 10^7$K), making the interaction between the gas and incident photons very ineffective. Satellite galaxies in cluster environments, on the other hand, experience a high radiation flux due to the emission from the host halo. Low mass satellites ($&lt; 10^{12}\rm{M_\odot}$) in particular have virial temperatures that are exactly in the regime where the effect of the radiation field is maximal. Idealised simulations of satellite galaxies including only the effect of host halo radiation (no ram pressure stripping or tidal effects) fields show a drastic reduction in the amount of cool gas formed ($\sim 40\%$) on a short timescale of about $0.5$ Gyrs. A galaxy merger simulation including all the other environmental quenching mechanisms, shows about $20\%$ reduction in the stellar mass of the satellite and about $\sim 30\%$ reduction in star formation rate after $1$ Gyr due to the host hot halo radiation field. These results indicate that the hot halo radiation fields potentially play an important role in quenching galaxies in cluster environments.",1

1210,0,"Direct observation of laser guided corona discharges Laser based lightning control holds a promising way to solve the problem of the long standing disaster of lightning strikes. But it is a challenging project due to insufficient understanding of the interaction between laser plasma channel and high voltage electric filed. In this work, a direct observation of laser guided corona discharge is reported. The high voltage corona discharge can be guided along laser plasma filament, and enhanced through the interaction with laser filaments. The fluorescence lifetime of laser filament guided corona discharge was measured to be several microseconds, which is 3 orders of magnitude longer than the fluorescence lifetime of laser filaments. This could be advantageous towards laser assisted leader development in the atmosphere.",1
1214,0,"Pump Linewidth Requirements for Processing Dispersion-Altered DQPSK Signals using FWM We report on a potentially deleterious issue regarding the four-wave mixing based processing of dispersion-altered signals. We estimate the baudrate-dependent pump linewidth tolerances by calculating the extra optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) penalty with respect to the propagation distance. We find that the issue is not important for 10 Gbaud differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) signals, though for 28 Gbaud (and 56 Gbaud) DQPSK signals we find that the pump linewidth requirements to implement FWM based optical signal processing needs to be in the sub-MHz range in order to avoid excessive OSNR penalties for the case of dispersion-altered signals. These results are pertinent for systems employing FWM, which could be all-optical wavelength converters for packet switching or mid-span spectral inversion techniques.",1
1368,0,"Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): Stellar mass growth of spiral galaxies in the cosmic web We look for correlated changes in stellar mass and star formation rate along filaments in the cosmic web by examining the stellar masses and UV-derived star formation rates (SFR) of 1,799 ungrouped and unpaired spiral galaxies that reside in filaments. We devise multiple distance metrics to characterise the complex geometry of filaments, and find that galaxies closer to the cylindrical centre of a filament have higher stellar masses than their counterparts near the periphery of filaments, on the edges of voids. In addition, these peripheral spiral galaxies have higher specific star formation rates (SSFR) at a given mass. Complementing our sample of filament spiral galaxies with spiral galaxies in tendrils and voids, we find that the average SFR of these objects in different large scale environments are similar to each other with the primary discriminant in SFR being stellar mass, in line with previous works. However, the distributions of SFRs are found to vary with large-scale environment. Our results thus suggest a model in which in addition to stellar mass as the primary discriminant, the large-scale environment is imprinted in the SFR as a second order effect. Furthermore, our detailed results for filament galaxies suggest a model in which gas accretion from voids onto filaments is primarily in an orthogonal direction. Overall, we find our results to be in line with theoretical expectations of the thermodynamic properties of the intergalactic medium in different large-scale environments.",1
1419,0,"Self-organized surface nanopatterning by ion beam sputtering The production of nanopatterns on the surfaces of targets irradiated by ion beams at low and intermediate energies has developed during the present decade to a salient degree of control over the main pattern features. However, there is still a wide experimental scatter in the type and relevance of various dynamic interfacial properties induced by this technique as a function of system type and parameters. In parallel, diverse theoretical models exist that differ in their capabilities to reproduce such a wide range of experimental features. We provide an overview of the most recent studies of nanoripple and dot production by ion-beam sputtering, with special attention to the comparison between experiments and (continuum) models, and with a focus on those issues that remain open or, at least, ambiguous. These are perhaps more evident for the case of nanodot patterns on amorphizable targets than for the case of nanoripples due, possibly, to the relative novelty of the former. The pattern properties to be considered are those of potential increased technological importance, such as the variation of nanodot size with parameters like ion energy, target temperature and sputtering time (i.e., fluence), as well as the conditions under which the quality of the pattern order is enhanced, issues such as wavelength coarsening and order enhancement becoming relevant.",1
1489,0,"Topological superconductivity in ferromagnetic atom chains beyond the deep-impurity regime Recent developments in the search for topological superconductivity have brought lattices of magnetic adatoms on a superconductor into intense focus. In this work we will study ferromagnetic chains of adatoms on superconducting surfaces with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Generalising the deep-impurity approach employed extensively in previous works to arbitrary subgap energies, we formulate the theory of the subgap spectrum as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem. We obtain an essentially analytical description of the subgap spectrum, allowing an efficient study of the topological properties. Employing a flat-band Hamiltonian sharing the topological properties of the chain, we evaluate the $\mathbb{Z}$-valued winding number and discover five distinct topological phases. Our results also confirm that the topological band formation does not require the decoupled Shiba energies to be fine-tuned to the gap centre. We also study the properties of Majorana bound states in the system.",1
1514,0,"The Speedster-EXD- A New Event-Driven Hybrid CMOS X-ray Detector The Speedster-EXD is a new 64x64 pixel, 40 $\mu$m pixel pitch, 100 $\mu$m depletion depth hybrid CMOS X-ray detector (HCD) with the capability of reading out only those pixels containing event charge, thus enabling fast effective frame rates. A global charge threshold can be specified, and pixels containing charge above this threshold are flagged and read out. The Speedster detector has also been designed with other advanced in-pixel features to improve performance, including a low-noise, high-gain CTIA amplifier that eliminates interpixel capacitance crosstalk (IPC), and in-pixel Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) subtraction to reduce reset noise. We measure the best energy resolution on the Speedster-EXD detector to be 206 eV (3.5 %) at 5.89 keV and 172 eV (10.0 %) at 1.49 keV. The average IPC to the four adjacent pixels is measured to be 0.25 $\pm$ 0.2 % (i.e. consistent with zero). The pixel-to-pixel gain variation is measured to be 0.80 $\pm$ 0.03 %, and a Monte Carlo simulation is applied to better characterize the contributions to the energy resolution.",1
1593,0,"Braiding properties of Majorana Kramers Pairs We consider the braiding of Kramers pairs of Majorana bound states. We derive the most general transformation on the many-body ground state that is applied as the result of such a braiding process. The result is derived in the context of a simple toy model, but we will show that it has the most general form that is compatible with local and global conservation of electron parity. In accordance with earlier work the resulting transformation turns out to be path dependent, which shows that Kramers pairs of Majorana bound states cannot be used for topological quantum computation. We also discuss under which conditions the result is path independent and corresponds to two independent exchanges of pairs of Majorana bound states.",1
1665,0,"3D-Printing for Analytical Ultracentrifugation Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a classical technique of physical biochemistry providing information on size, shape, and interactions of macromolecules from the analysis of their migration in centrifugal fields while free in solution. A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by 3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but still below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication paradigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a variety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource allocation.",1
1686,0,"Suppressing Background Radiation Using Poisson Principal Component Analysis Performance of nuclear threat detection systems based on gamma-ray spectrometry often strongly depends on the ability to identify the part of measured signal that can be attributed to background radiation. We have successfully applied a method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain a compact null-space model of background spectra using PCA projection residuals to derive a source detection score. We have shown the method's utility in a threat detection system using mobile spectrometers in urban scenes (Tandon et al 2012). While it is commonly assumed that measured photon counts follow a Poisson process, standard PCA makes a Gaussian assumption about the data distribution, which may be a poor approximation when photon counts are low. This paper studies whether and in what conditions PCA with a Poisson-based loss function (Poisson PCA) can outperform standard Gaussian PCA in modeling background radiation to enable more sensitive and specific nuclear threat detection.",1
1738,0,"Time-modulated Hamiltonian for interpreting Mach-Zehnder interferometer delayed-choice experiments Many delayed-choice experiments based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) have been thought and made to address the fundamental problem of wave-particle duality. Conventional wisdoms long hold that by inserting or removing the second beam splitter (BS2) in a controllable way, microscopic particles (photons, electrons, etc.) transporting within the MZI can lie in the quantum superposition of the wave and particle state as \psi=a_w\psi_wave+a_p\psi_particle. Here we present an alternative interpretation to these delayed-choice experiments. We notice that as all composite devices of MZI including BS2 are purely classical, the inserting and removing operation of BS2 imposes a time-modulated Hamiltonian H_mod(t)=a(t)H_in+b(t)H_out, instead of a quantum superposition of H_in and H_out as H=a_wH_in+b_pH_out, to act upon the incident wave function. Solution of this quantum scattering problem, rather than the long held quantum eigen-problem yields a synchronically time-modulated output wave function as \psi_mod=a(t)\psi_wave+b(t)\psi_particle. As a result, the probability of particle output from the MZI behaves as if they are in the superposition of the wave and particle state when many events over time accumulation are counted and averaged. We expect these elementary but insightful analyses will shed a new light on exploring basic physics beyond the long-held wisdom of wave-particle duality and principle of complementarity.",1
1743,0,"Haar expectations of ratios of random characteristic polynomials We compute Haar ensemble averages of ratios of random characteristic polynomials for the classical Lie groups K = O(N), SO(N), and USp(N). To that end, we start from the Clifford-Weyl algebera in its canonical realization on the complex of holomorphic differential forms for a C-vector space V. From it we construct the Fock representation of an orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp associated to V. Particular attention is paid to defining Howe's oscillator semigroup and the representation that partially exponentiates the Lie algebra representation of sp in osp. In the process, by pushing the semigroup representation to its boundary and arguing by continuity, we provide a construction of the Shale-Weil-Segal representation of the metaplectic group. To deal with a product of n ratios of characteristic polynomials, we let V = C^n \otimes C^N where C^N is equipped with its standard K-representation, and focus on the subspace of K-equivariant forms. By Howe duality, this is a highest-weight irreducible representation of the centralizer g of Lie(K) in osp. We identify the K-Haar expectation of n ratios with the character of this g-representation, which we show to be uniquely determined by analyticity, Weyl group invariance, certain weight constraints and a system of differential equations coming from the Laplace-Casimir invariants of g. We find an explicit solution to the problem posed by all these conditions. In this way we prove that the said Haar expectations are expressed by a Weyl-type character formula for all integers N \ge 1. This completes earlier work by Conrey, Farmer, and Zirnbauer for the case of U(N).",1

1943,0,"Completing electron scattering studies with the inert gas column:e - Rn scattering and Ionization Interest in the inert or noble- gas atoms in general arises because they are ideal as test systems for various theoretical models of electron scattering and also since their interaction processes serve as reference for the determination of instrumental responses in electron scattering experiments. The ionization cross section data of ground state inert gas atoms He through Xe are considered to be benchmark data. Our aim in this paper is to provide theoretical results on electron scattering with Radon atoms, as it would complete the studies on the entire inert gas column. That is possible with this particular column only, in view of the preceding literature on He through Xe . Inert gas radon is radioactive, and would be a difficult target for electron scattering experiments. In the present calculations, the complications arising from radioactivity are not considered. We provide hitherto unavailable cross sections on atomic radon, and also provide opportunity of the comparison of electron impact cross sections over all the inert gas targets.",1
2082,0,"Entanglement structure of the two-channel Kondo model Two electronic channels competing to screen a single impurity spin, as in the two-channel Kondo model, are expected to generate a ground state with nontrivial entanglement structure. We exploit a spin-chain representation of the two-channel Kondo model to probe the ground-state block entropy, negativity, tangle, and Schmidt gap, using a density matrix renormalization group approach. In the presence of symmetric coupling to the two channels we confirm field-theory predictions for the boundary entropy difference, $\ln (g_{UV}/g_{IR})=\ln(2)/2$, between the ultraviolet and infrared limits and the leading $\ln(x)/x$ impurity correction to the block entropy. The impurity entanglement, $S_{\text{imp}}$, is shown to scale with the characteristic length $\xi_{2CK}$. We show that both the Schmidt gap and the entanglement of the impurity with one of the channels $-$ as measured by the negativity$-$ faithfully serve as order parameters for the impurity quantum phase transition appearing as a function of channel asymmetry, allowing for explicit determination of critical exponents, $\nu\!\approx\! 2$ and $\beta \!\approx\! 0.2$. Remarkably, we find the emergence of tripartite entanglement only in the vicinity of the critical channel-symmetric point.",1
2145,0,"Strong Gravitational Lensing and the Stellar IMF of Early-type Galaxies Systematic variations of the IMF in early-type galaxies, and their connection with possible drivers such as velocity dispersion or metallicity, have been much debated in recent years. Strong lensing over galaxy scales combined with photometric and spectroscopic data provides a powerful method to constrain the stellar mass-to-light ratio and hence the functional form of the IMF. We combine photometric and spectroscopic constraints from the latest set of population synthesis models of Charlot &amp; Bruzual, including a varying IMF, with a non-parametric analysis of the lens masses of 18 ETGs from the SLACS survey, with velocity dispersions in the range 200-300 km/s. We find that very bottom-heavy IMFs are excluded. However, the upper limit to the bimodal IMF slope ($\mu \lesssim 2.2$, accounting for a dark matter fraction of 20-30%, where $\mu=1.3$ corresponds to a Kroupa-like IMF) is compatible at the $1\sigma$ level with constraints imposed by gravity-sensitive line strengths. A two-segment power law parameterisation of the IMF (Salpeter-like for high masses) is more constrained ($\Gamma \lesssim 1.5$, where $\Gamma$ is the power index at low masses) but requires a dark matter contribution of $\gtrsim 25\%$ to reconcile the results with a Salpeter IMF. For a standard Milky Way-like IMF to be applicable, a significant dark matter contribution is required within $1R_e$. Our results reveal a large range of allowed IMF slopes, which, when interpreted as intrinsic scatter in the IMF properties of ETGs, could explain the recent results of Smith et al., who find Milky Way-like IMF normalisations in a few massive lensing ETGs.",1
2348,0,"Lie symmetries of (1+2) nonautonomous evolution equations in Financial Mathematics We analyse two classes of $(1+2)$ evolution equations which are of special interest in Financial Mathematics, namely the Two-dimensional Black-Scholes Equation and the equation for the Two-factor Commodities Problem. Our approach is that of Lie Symmetry Analysis. We study these equations for the case in which they are autonomous and for the case in which the parameters of the equations are unspecified functions of time. For the autonomous Black-Scholes Equation we find that the symmetry is maximal and so the equation is reducible to the $(1+2)$ Classical Heat Equation. This is not the case for the nonautonomous equation for which the number of symmetries is submaximal. In the case of the two-factor equation the number of symmetries is submaximal in both autonomous and nonautonomous cases. When the solution symmetries are used to reduce each equation to a $(1+1)$ equation, the resulting equation is of maximal symmetry and so equivalent to the $(1+1)$ Classical Heat Equation.",1

Recent progress in the study of magnetic fields is revealing the close connection between star formation and its effect on the small-scale structure in the magnetized interstellar medium (ISM). In this contribution we describe how the modern generation of radio telescopes is being used to probe the physics of the ISM through sensitive multiwavelength surveys of gas and magnetic fields, from the inner star forming disk and outward into the galaxy outskirts where large-scale magnetic fields may also play a key role. We highlight unique pioneering efforts towards performing and scientifically exploiting large-scale surveys of the type that the SKA will undertake routinely. Looking to the future, we describe plans for using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinders to gain important new insights into the cosmic history of galaxy evolution.",1

2527,0,"Interference Effect of Majorana Fermions in a Spin-orbit Coupled Superconducting Wire Two majorana Fermions (MFs) localized at the two ends of the topological superconducting wire can interfere with each other and form the well known $4\pi$ Josephson current. We reveal that the density of states (Dos) for the electron part and the hole part also follow a parity correlated $4\pi$ period oscillation, while the Dos displays a $2\pi$ period oscillation when two trivial states interfere with each other. Thus, the period of Dos oscillation can be used to distinguish the MFs from the trivial localized states. Interestingly, such phenomena can be directly observed in a short superconducting wire controlled by the gate voltage. This largely simplifies the experimental setup. We suggest that the interference effects can be detected through two STM leads or two norm leads.",1
2535,0,"Limits on the validity of the thin-layer model of the ionosphere for radio interferometric calibration For a ground-based radio interferometer observing at low frequencies, the ionosphere causes propagation delays and refraction of cosmic radio waves which result in phase errors in the received signal. These phase errors can be corrected using a calibration method that assumes a two-dimensional phase screen at a fixed altitude above the surface of the Earth, known as the thin-layer model. Here we investigate the validity of the thin-layer model and provide a simple equation with which users can check when this approximation can be applied to observations for varying time of day, zenith angle, interferometer latitude, baseline length, ionospheric electron content and observing frequency.",1
2600,0,R-matrix approach to integrable systems on time scales A general unifying framework for integrable soliton-like systems on time scales is introduced. The $R$-matrix formalism is applied to the algebra of $\delta$-differential operators in terms of which one can construct infinite hierarchy of commuting vector fields. The theory is illustrated by two infinite-field integrable hierarchies on time scales which are difference counterparts of KP and mKP. The difference counterparts of AKNS and Kaup-Broer soliton systems are constructed as related finite-field restrictions.,1
2601,0,"Poynting flux in the neighbourhood of a point charge in arbitrary motion and the radiative power losses We examine the electromagnetic fields in the neighbourhood of a ""point charge"" in arbitrary motion and thereby determine the Poynting flux across a spherical surface of vanishingly small radius surrounding the charge. We show that the radiative power losses from a point charge turn out to be proportional to the scalar product of the instantaneous velocity and the first time-derivative of the acceleration of the charge. This may seem to be in discordance with the familiar Larmor's formula where the instantaneous power radiated from a charge is proportional to the square of acceleration. However, it seems that the root cause of the discrepancy actually lies in the Larmor's formula which is derived using the acceleration fields but without a due consideration for the Poynting flux associated with the velocity-dependent self-fields ""co-moving"" with the charge. Further, while deriving Larmor's formula one equates the Poynting flux through a surface at some later time to the radiation loss by the enclosed charge at the retarded time. Poynting's theorem, on the other hand, relates the outgoing radiation flux from a closed surface to the rate of energy decrease within the enclosed volume, all calculated {\em for the same given instant} only. Here we explicitly show the absence of any Poynting flux in the neighbourhood of an instantly stationary point charge, implying no radiative losses from such a charge, which is in complete conformity with energy conservation. We further show how Larmor's formula is still able to serve our purpose in vast majority of cases. It is further shown that Larmor's formula in general violates momentum conservation and in the case of synchrotron radiation leads to a potentially wrong conclusion about the pitch angle changes of the radiating charges, and that only the radiation reaction formula yields a correct result, consistent with the special relativity.",1

2846,0,"Experimental demonstration of binary shaped pupil mask coronagraphs for telescopes with obscured pupils We present the fabrication and experimental demonstration of three free-standing binary shaped pupil mask coronagraphs, which are applicable for telescopes with partially obscured pupils. Three masks, designed to be complementary (labeled Mask-A, Mask-B, and Mask-C), were formed in 5 micron thick nickel. The design of Mask-A is based on a one-dimensional barcode mask. The design principle of Mask-B is similar, but has a smaller inner working angle and a lower contrast than Mask-A. Mask-C is based on a concentric ring mask and provides the widest dark region and a symmetric point spread function. Mask-A and Mask-C were both designed to produce a flexibly tailored dark region (i.e., non-uniform contrast). The contrast was evaluated using a light source comprising a broadband super-luminescent light-emitting diode with a center wavelength of 650 nm, and the measurements were carried out in a large vacuum chamber. Active wavefront control was not applied in this work. The coronagraphic images obtained by experiment were mostly consistent with the designs. The contrast of Mask-A within the ranges 3.3 - 8 lambda/D and 8 - 12 lambda/D was ~10^{-4} - 10^{-7} and ~10^{-7}, respectively, where lambda is the wavelength and D is the pupil diameter. The contrast close to the center of Mask-B was ~10^{-4} and that of Mask-C over an extended field of view (5 - 25 lambda/D) was ~10^{-5} - 10^{-6}. The effect of tilting the masks was investigated, and found to be irrelevant at the ~10^{-7} contrast level. Therefore the masks can be tilted to avoid ghosting. These high-contrast free-standing masks have the potential to enable coronagraphic imaging over a wide wavelength range using both ground-based and space-borne general-purpose telescopes with pupil structures not specifically designed for coronagraphy.",1

In agreement with bosonization theory, we show that the ground state of the system in the thermodynamic limit corresponds to the Pfaffian-like state when the system is tuned towards the superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum phase transition.

We reassess earlier predictions of Pluto's fate, and rule out the hypothesis that Pluto's mass has been constant over the last century. We are able to fit linear and quadratic equations to Pluto's mass as a function of both time and distance. The observations that will be made by New Horizons will help to determine if we can expect Pluto to continue to shrink until it has negative mass, or if it will begin to increase in mass again.",1
2990,0,"An Efficient Matrix Product Operator Representation of the Quantum-Chemical Hamiltonian We describe how to efficiently construct the quantum chemical Hamiltonian operator in matrix product form. We present its implementation as a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for quantum chemical applications in a purely matrix product based framework. Existing implementations of DMRG for quantum chemistry are based on the traditional formulation of the method, which was developed from a viewpoint of Hilbert space decimation and attained a higher performance compared to straightforward implementations of matrix product based DMRG. The latter variationally optimizes a class of ansatz states known as matrix product states (MPS), where operators are correspondingly represented as matrix product operators (MPO). The MPO construction scheme presented here eliminates the previous performance disadvantages while retaining the additional flexibility provided by a matrix product approach; for example, the specification of expectation values becomes an input parameter. In this way, MPOs for different symmetries - abelian and non-abelian - and different relativistic and non-relativistic models may be solved by an otherwise unmodified program.",1
2997,0,"Torus mapper: a code for dynamical models of galaxies We present a freely downloadable software package for modelling the dynamics of galaxies, which we call the Torus Mapper (TM). The package is based around `torus mapping', which is a non-perturbative technique for creating orbital tori for specified values of the action integrals. Given an orbital torus and a star's position at a reference time, one can compute its position at any other time, no matter how remote. One can also compute the velocities with which the star will pass through any given point and the contribution it will make to the time-averaged density there. A system of angle-action coordinates for the given potential can be created by foliating phase space with orbital tori. Such a foliation is facilitated by the ability of TM to create tori by interpolating on a grid of tori. We summarise the advantages of using TM rather than a standard time-stepper to create orbits, and give segments of code that illustrate applications of TM in several contexts, including setting up initial conditions for an N-body simulation. We examine the precision of the orbital tori created by TM and the behaviour of the code when orbits become trapped by a resonance.",1

3542,0,"Tidal capture formation of Low Mass X-Ray Binaries from wide binaries in the field We present a potentially efficient dynamical formation scenario for Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) in the field, focusing on black-hole (BH) LMXBs. In this formation channel LMXBs are formed from wide binaries $(&gt;1000$ AU) with a BH component and a stellar companion. The wide binary is perturbed by fly-by's of field stars and its orbit random-walks and changes over time. This diffusion process can drive the binary into a sufficiently eccentric orbit such that the binary components tidally interact at peri-center and the binary evolves to become a short period binary, which eventually evolves into an LMXB. The formation rate of LMXBs through this channel mostly depends on the number of such BH wide binaries progenitors, which in turn depends on the velocity kicks imparted to BHs (or NSs) at birth. We consider several models for the formation and survival of such wide binaries, and calculate the LMXB formation rates for each model. We find that models where BHs form through direct collapse with no/little natal kicks can give rise to high formation rates comparable with those inferred from observations. This formation scenario had several observational signatures: (1) the number density of LMXBs generally follows the background stellar density and (2) the mass function of the BH stellar companion should be comparable to the mass function of the background stellar population, likely peaking at $0.4-0.6$ M$_{\odot}$. The latter aspect, in particular, is unique to this model compared with previously suggested LMXB formation models following common envelope binary stellar evolution. We note that NS LMXBs can similarly form from wide binaries, but their formation rate through this channel is likely significantly smaller due to their much higher natal kicks.",1

Generically, we find that the HgTe-class materials with nontrivial band inversion and noncentrosymmetry provide a promising arena to realize ideal Weyl semimetals. Such ideal Weyl semimetals could further provide a unique platform to study emergent phenomena such as the interplay between ideal Weyl fermions and superconductivity in the half-Heusler compound LaPtBi.",1
3699,0,"Vorticity and Symplecticity in Multi-Symplectic Lagrangian Gas Dynamics The Lagrangian, multi-dimensional, ideal, compressible gasdynamic equations are written in a multi-symplectic form, in which the Lagrangian fluid labels, $m^i$ (the Lagrangian mass coordinates) and time $t$ are the independent variables, and in which the Eulerian position of the fluid element ${\bf x}={\bf x}({\bf m},t)$ and the entropy $S=S({\bf m},t)$ are the dependent variables. Constraints in the variational principle are incorporated by means of Lagrange multipliers. The constraints are: the entropy advection equation $S_t=0$, the Lagrangian map equation ${\bf x}_t={\bf u}$ where ${\bf u}$ is the fluid velocity, and the mass continuity equation which has the form $J=\tau$ where $J=\det(x_{ij})$ is the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map in which $x_{ij}=\partial x^i/\partial m^j$ and $\tau=1/\rho$ is the specific volume of the gas. The internal energy per unit volume of the gas $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\rho,S)$ corresponds to a non-barotropic gas. The Lagrangian is used to define multi-momenta, and to develop de-Donder Weyl Hamiltonian equations. The de Donder Weyl equations are cast in a multi-symplectic form. The pullback conservation laws and the symplecticity conservation laws are obtained. One class of symplecticity conservation laws give rise to vorticity and potential vorticity type conservation laws, and another class of symplecticity laws are related to derivatives of the Lagrangian energy conservation law with respect to the Lagrangian mass coordinates $m^i$. We show that the vorticity-symplecticity laws can be derived by a Lie dragging method, and also by using Noether's second theorem and a fluid relabelling symmetry which is a divergence symmetry of the action. We obtain the Cartan-Poincar\'e form describing the equations and we discuss a set of differential forms representing the equation system.",1

For the great majority of our galaxies, we find that the detected point sources most likely are local to their associated galaxy, and are thus extragalactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) or nuclear active galactic nuclei (AGNs). For spiral and irregular galaxies, we find that, after accounting for AGNs and nuclear sources, most CG galaxies are either within the $\pm1\sigma$ scatter of the Mineo et al. (2012) $L_X$ - star formation rate (SFR) correlation or have higher $L_X$ than predicted by this correlation for their SFR. We discuss how these ""excesses"" may be due to low metallicities and high interaction levels. For elliptical and S0 galaxies, after accounting for AGNs and nuclear sources, most CG galaxies are consistent with the Boroson et al. (2011) $L_X$ - stellar mass correlation for low-mass XRBs, with larger scatter, likely due to residual effects such as AGN activity or hot gas. Assuming non-nuclear sources are low- or high-mass XRBs, we use appropriate XRB luminosity functions to estimate the probability that stochastic effects can lead to such extreme $L_X$ values. We find that, although stochastic effects do not in general appear to be important, for some galaxies there is a significant probability that high $L_X$ values can be observed due to strong XRB variability.",1

Theoretical modeling of such low-dimensional semiconductors is generally based on phenomenological effective models. However, a more microscopic understanding of their band structure and, especially, of the spin-orbit coupling of electrons in these devices is important for optimizing their parameters for applications in quantum computing. In this paper, we approach this problem by first obtaining a highly accurate effective tight-binding model from ab initio calculations in the bulk. This model is symmetrized and correctly reproduces both the band structure and the wavefunction character. It is then used to determine Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit splittings induced by finite size effects and external electric field in zincblende InSb one- and two-dimensional nanostructures as a function of growth parameters.

3991,0,"Novel Quantum Criticality in Two Dimensional Topological Phase transitions Topological quantum phase transitions intrinsically intertwine self-similarity and topology of many-electron wave-functions, and divining them is one of the most significant ways to advance understanding in condensed matter physics. Our focus is to investigate an unconventional class of the transitions between insulators and Dirac semimetals whose description is beyond conventional pseudo relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian. At the transition without the long-range Coulomb interaction, the electronic energy dispersion along one direction behaves like a relativistic particle, linear in momentum, but along the other direction it behaves like a non-relativistic particle, quadratic in momentum. Various physical systems ranging from TiO${}_2$-VO${}_2$ heterostructure to organic material $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)${}_2$ I${}_3$ under pressure have been proposed to have such anisotropic dispersion relation. Here, we discover a novel quantum criticality at the phase transition by incorporating the 1/r long-range Coulomb interaction. Unique interplay between the Coulomb interaction and electronic critical modes enforces not only the anisotropic renormalization of the Coulomb interaction but also marginally modified electronic excitation. In connection with experiments, we investigate several striking effects in physical observables of our novel criticality.",1

We develop a unified description of topological phases and their invariants in driven systems, by using scattering theory. We show that scattering matrix invariants correctly describe the topological phase, even when all bulk Floquet bands are trivial. Additionally, we use scattering theory to introduce and analyze new periodically driven phases, such as weak topological Floquet insulators, for which invariants were previously unknown.

Ultrashort multi-petawatt (MPW) pulses possess broad bandwidths and extreme intensities, and, as a result, their interaction with the plasma lens is neither steady state nor linear. Here we examine nonlinear and time-dependent modifications to plasma lens focusing, and show that these result in chromatic and phase aberrations and amplitude distortion. We find that a plasma lens can provide enhanced focusing for 30 fs pulses with peak power up to ~1 PW. The performance degrades through the MPW regime, until finally a focusing penalty is incurred at ~10 PW.",1
4648,0,"Reconstruction of Fine Scale Auroral Dynamics We present a feasibility study for a high frame rate, short baseline auroral tomographic imaging system useful for estimating parametric variations in the precipitating electron number flux spectrum of dynamic auroral events. Of particular interest are auroral substorms, characterized by spatial variations of order 100 m and temporal variations of order 10 ms. These scales are thought to be produced by dispersive Alfv\'en waves in the near-Earth magnetosphere. The auroral tomography system characterized in this paper reconstructs the auroral volume emission rate to estimate the characteristic energy and location in the direction perpendicular to the geomagnetic field of peak electron precipitation flux using a distributed network of precisely synchronized ground-based cameras. As the observing baseline decreases, the tomographic inverse problem becomes highly ill-conditioned; as the sampling rate increases, the signal-to-noise ratio degrades and synchronization requirements become increasingly critical. Our approach to these challenges uses a physics-based auroral model to regularize the poorly-observed vertical dimension. Specifically, the vertical dimension is expanded in a low-dimensional basis consisting of eigenprofiles computed over the range of expected energies in the precipitating electron flux, while the horizontal dimension retains a standard orthogonal pixel basis. Simulation results show typical characteristic energy estimation error less than 30% for a 3 km baseline achievable within the confines of the Poker Flat Research Range, using GPS-synchronized Electron Multiplying CCD cameras with broad-band BG3 optical filters that pass prompt auroral emissions.",1

4695,0,"The different baryonic Tully-Fisher relations at low masses We compare the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) of simulations and observations of galaxies ranging from dwarfs to spirals, using various measures of rotational velocity Vrot. We explore the BTFR when measuring Vrot at the flat part of the rotation curve, Vflat, at the extent of HI gas, Vlast, and using 20% (W20) and 50% (W50) of the width of HI line profiles. We also compare with the maximum circular velocity of the parent halo, Vmax, within dark matter only simulations. The different BTFRs increasingly diverge as galaxy mass decreases. Using Vlast one obtains a power law over four orders of magnitude in baryonic mass, with slope similar to the observed BTFR. Measuring Vflat gives similar results as Vlast when galaxies with rising rotation curves are excluded. However, higher rotation velocities would be found for low mass galaxies if the cold gas extended far enough for Vrot to reach a maximum. W20 gives a similar slope as Vlast but with slightly lower values of Vrot for low mass galaxies, although this may depend on the extent of the gas in your galaxy sample. W50 bends away from these other relations toward low velocities at low masses. By contrast, Vmax bends toward high velocities for low mass galaxies, as cold gas does not extend out to the radius at which halos reach Vmax. Our study highlights the need for careful comparisons between observations and models: one needs to be consistent about the particular method of measuring Vrot, and precise about the radius at which velocities are measured.",1
4806,0,"Polyelectrolyte assisted charge titration spectrometry: applications to latex and oxide nanoparticles The electrostatic charge density of particles is of paramount importance for the control of the dispersion stability. Conventional methods use potentiometric, conductometric or turbidity titration but require large amount of samples. Here we report a simple and cost-effective method called polyelectrolyte assisted charge titration spectrometry or PACTS. The technique takes advantage of the propensity of oppositely charged polymers and particles to assemble upon mixing, leading to aggregation or phase separation. The mixed dispersions exhibit a maximum in light scattering as a function of the volumetric ratio X, and the peak position XMax is linked to the particle charge density according to {\sigma} ~ D0 XMax where D0 is the particle diameter. The PACTS is successfully applied to organic latex, aluminum and silicon oxide particles of positive or negative charge using poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate). The protocol is also optimized with respect to important parameters such as pH and concentration, and to the polyelectrolyte molecular weight. The advantages of the PACTS technique are that it requires minute amounts of sample and that it is suitable to a broad variety of charged nano-objects.",1
4836,0,"Bulk-edge correspondence of one-dimensional quantum walks We outline a theory of symmetry protected topological phases of one-dimensional quantum walks. We assume spectral gaps around the symmetry-distinguished points +1 and -1, in which only discrete eigenvalues are allowed. The phase classification by integer or binary indices extends the classification known for translation invariant systems in terms of their band structure. However, our theory requires no translation invariance whatsoever, and the indices we define in this general setting are invariant under arbitrary symmetric local perturbations, even those that cannot be continuously contracted to the identity. More precisely we define two indices for every walk, characterizing the behavior far to the right and far to the left, respectively. Their sum is a lower bound on the number of eigenstates at +1 and -1. For a translation invariant system the indices add up to zero, so one of them already characterizes the phase. By joining two bulk phases with different indices we get a walk in which the right and left indices no longer cancel, so the theory predicts bound states at +1 or -1. This is a rigorous statement of bulk-edge correspondence. The results also apply to the Hamiltonian case with a single gap at zero.",1
4871,0,"A mature galaxy cluster at z=1.58 around the radio galaxy 7C1753+6311 We report on the discovery of a z=1.58 mature cluster around the high-redshift radio galaxy 7C1753+6311, first identified in the Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN survey. Two-thirds of the excess galaxies within the central 1Mpc lie on a red sequence with a colour that is consistent with an average formation redshift of zf~3. We show that 80+/-6% of the red sequence galaxies in the cluster core are quiescent, while the remaining 20% are red due to dusty star formation. We demonstrate that the cluster has an enhanced quiescent galaxy fraction that is three times that of the control field. We also show that this enhancement is mass dependent: 91+/-9% of the M* &gt;10^{10.5}Msun cluster galaxies are quiescent, compared to only 36+/-2% of field galaxies, whereas the fraction of quiescent galaxies with lower masses is the same in the cluster and field environments. The presence of a dense core and a well-formed, quiescent red sequence suggest that this is a mature cluster. This means that distant radio galaxies do not solely reside in young, uncollapsed protoclusters, rather they can be found in clusters in a wide range of evolutionary states.",1
4919,0,"Finite size corrections in random matrix theory and Odlyzko's data set for the Riemann zeros Odlyzko has computed a data set listing more than $10^9$ successive Riemann zeros, starting at a zero number beyond $10^{23}$. The data set relates to random matrix theory since, according to the Montgomery-Odlyzko law, the statistical properties of the large Riemann zeros agree with the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of large random Hermitian matrices. Moreover, Keating and Snaith, and then Bogomolny and collaborators, have used $N \times N$ random unitary matrices to analyse deviations from this law. We contribute to this line of study in two ways. First, we point out that a natural process to apply to the data set is to thin it by deleting each member independently with some specified probability, and we proceed to compute empirical two-point correlation functions and nearest neighbour spacings in this setting. Second, we show how to characterise the order $1/N^2$ correction term to the spacing distribution for random unitary matrices in terms of a second order differential equation with coefficients that are Painlev\'e transcendents, and where the thinning parameter appears only in the boundary condition. This equation can be solved numerically using a power series method. Comparison with the Riemann zero data shows accurate agreement.",1

4939,0,"Photon-counting Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry based on up-conversion detector and fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer A direct-detection Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR) is proposed and demonstrated by using an up-conversion single-photon detector and a fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer (FFP-SI). Taking advantage of high signal-to-noise ratio of the detector and high spectrum resolution of the FFP-SI, the Brillouin spectrum along a polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) is recorded on a multiscaler with a small data size directly. In contrast with conventional BOTDR adopting coherent detection, photon-counting BOTDR is simpler in structure and easier in data processing. In the demonstration experiment, characteristic parameters of the Brillouin spectrum including its power, spectral width and frequency center are analyzed simultaneously along a 10 km PMF at different temperature and stain conditions.",1
4969,0,"Stopping narrow-band x-ray pulses in nuclear media A control mechanism for stopping x-ray pulses in resonant nuclear media is investigated theoretically. We show that narrow-band x-ray pulses can be mapped and stored as nuclear coherence in a thin-film planar x-ray cavity with an embedded $^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$ nuclear layer. The pulse is nearly resonant to the 14.4 keV M\""ossbauer transition in the $^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$ nuclei. The role of the control field is played here by a hyperfine magnetic field which induces interference effects reminding of electromagnetically induced transparency. We show that by switching off the control magnetic field, a narrow-band x-ray pulse can be completely stored in the cavity for approximately 100 ns. Additional manipulation of the external magnetic field can lead to both group velocity and phase control of the pulse in the x-ray cavity sample.",1
4970,0,"Lyman continuum leaking from the compact star-forming dwarf galaxy J0925+1403 One of the key questions in observational cosmology is the identification of the sources responsible for ionisation of the Universe after the cosmic Dark Ages, when the baryonic matter was neutral. The currently identified distant galaxies are insufficient to fully reionise the Universe by redshift z~6, but low-mass star-forming galaxies are thought to be responsible for the bulk of the ionising radiation. Since direct observations at high redshift are difficult for a variety of reasons, one solution is to identify local proxies of this galaxy population. However, starburst galaxies at low redshifts are generally opaque to their ionising radiation. This radiation with small escape fractions of 1-3% is directly detected only in three low-redshift galaxies. Here we present far-ultraviolet observations of a nearby low-mass star-forming galaxy, J0925+1403, selected for its compactness and high excitation. The galaxy is leaking ionising radiation, with an escape fraction of ~8%. The total number of photons emitted during the starburst phase is sufficient to ionize intergalactic medium material, which is about 40 times more massive than the stellar mass of the galaxy.",1
5030,0,"Delocalization for random displacement models with Dirac masses We study a random Schroedinger operator, the Laplacian with random Dirac delta potentials on a torus T^d_L = R^d/LZ^d, in the thermodynamic limit L\to\infty, for dimension d=2. The potentials are located on a randomly distorted lattice Z^2+\omega, where the displacements are i.i.d. random variables sampled from a compactly supported probability density. We prove that, if the disorder is sufficiently weak, there exists a certain energy threshold E_0&gt;0 above which exponential localization of the eigenfunctions must break down. In fact we can rule out any decay faster than a certain polynomial one. Our results are obtained by translating the problem of the distribution of eigenfunctions of the random Schroedinger operator into a study of the spatial distribution of two point correlation densities of certain random superpositions of Green's functions and its relation with a lattice point problem.",1
5095,0,"Of Bulk and Boundaries: Generalized Transfer Matrices for Tight-Binding Models We construct a generalized transfer matrix corresponding to noninteracting tight-binding lattice models, which can subsequently be used to compute the bulk bands as well as the edge states. Crucially, our formalism works even in cases where the hopping matrix is non-invertible. Following Hatsugai [PRL 71, 3697 (1993)], we explicitly construct the energy Riemann surfaces associated with the band structure for a specific class of systems which includes systems like Chern insulator, Dirac semimetal and graphene. The edge states can then be interpreted as non-contractible loops, with the winding number equal to the bulk Chern number. For these systems, the transfer matrix is symplectic, and hence we also describe the windings associated with the edge states on $Sp(2, \mathbb{R})$ and interpret the corresponding winding number as a Maslov index.",1
5117,0,"A global galactic dynamo with a corona constrained by relative helicity We present a model for a global axisymmetric turbulent dynamo operating in a galaxy with a corona which treats the supernovae (SNe) and magneto-rotational instability (MRI) driven turbulence parameters under a common formalism. The nonlinear quenching of the dynamo is alleviated by inclusion of small-scale advective and diffusive magnetic helicity fluxes, which allow the gauge invariant magnetic helicity to be transferred outside the disk and consequently build up a corona during the course of dynamo action. The time-dependent dynamo equations are expressed in a separable form and solved through an eigenvector expansion constructed using the steady-state solutions of the dynamo equation. The parametric evolution of the dynamo solution allows us to estimate the final structure of the global magnetic field and the saturated value of the turbulence parameter $\alpha_m$, even before solving the dynamical equations for evolution of magnetic fields in the disk and the corona, along with $\alpha$-quenching. We then solve these equations simultaneously to study the saturation of large-scale magnetic field, its dependence on the small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes and corresponding evolution of the force-free field in the corona. The quadrupolar large-scale magnetic field in the disk is found to reach equipartition strength within a timescale of 1 Gyr. The large-scale magnetic field in the corona obtained is much weaker in strength compared to the field inside the disk and has only a weak impact on the dynamo operation.",1
5258,0,"Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): The 325 MHz Radio Luminosity Function of AGN and Star Forming Galaxies Measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution over cosmic time. Radio continuum observations can provide key information on these two processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jets in AGN, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formation rates. In this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 MHz for a sample of AGN and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio survey conducted with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), with optical imaging and redshifts from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We find that the radio luminosity function at 325 MHz for star-forming galaxies closely follows that measured at 1.4 GHz. By fitting the AGN radio luminosity function out to $z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\Phi} \propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \pm 0.95$ assuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \pm 1.96$ assuming pure luminosity evolution. We find that the Low Excitation Radio Galaxies are the dominant population in space density at lower luminosities. Comparing our 325 MHz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 GHz, we determine separate radio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum AGN, and show that the beamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted in number density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population of steep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification of AGN.",1
5328,0,"Role of the Ward Identity and Relevance of the G0W0 Approximation in Normal and Superconducting States On the basis of the self-consistent calculation scheme for the electron self-energy with the use of the three-point vertex function always satisfying the Ward identity, we find that the obtained quasiparticle dispersion in the normal state in gapped systems such as semiconductors, insulators, and molecules is well reproduced by that in the one-shot GW (or G0W0) approximation. In calculating the superconducting transition temperature Tc, we also find a similar situation; the result for Tc in the gauge-invariant self-consistent (GISC) framework including the effect of the vertex corrections satisfying the Ward identity is different from that in the conventional Eliashberg theory (which amounts to the GW approximation for superconductivity) but is close to that in the G0W0 approximation. Those facts indicate that the G0W0 approximation actually takes proper account of both vertex and high-order self-energy corrections in a mutually cancelling manner and thus we can understand that the G0W0 approximation is better than the fully self-consistent GW one in obtaining some of physical quantities.",1

We relate the properties of such currents to the asymmetry of the spin resolved momentum distribution function, a quantity which is easily addressable in state-of-art experiments.

Conversely, this places constraints on the allowed symmetry enriched topological orders that can manifest in a fractionalized Fermi liquid with a given Fermi volume and density of fermions.",1

5748,0,"Preliminary Research on Dual-Energy X-Ray Phase-Contrast Imaging Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) has been widely applied to measure bone mineral density (BMD) and soft-tissue composition of human body. However, the use of DEXA is greatly limited for low-Z materials such as soft tissues due to their weak absorption. While X-ray phase-contrast imaging (XPCI) shows significantly improved contrast in comparison with the conventional standard absorption-based X-ray imaging for soft tissues. In this paper, we propose a novel X-ray phase-contrast method to measure the area density of low-Z materials, including a single-energy method and a dual-energy method. The single-energy method is for the area density calculation of one low-Z material, while the dual-energy method is aiming to calculate the area densities of two low-Z materials simultaneously. Comparing the experimental and simulation results with the theoretic ones, the new method proves to have the potential to replace DEXA in area density measurement. The new method sets the prerequisites for future precise and low-dose area density calculation method of low-Z materials.",1

These sources are so large that most interferometers lose partly their structure and total flux density. Therefore, single-dish detections are required to fill in the central (u,v) gap of interferometric data and obtain reliable spectral index patterns across the structures, and thus also an integrated radio continuum spectrum. We have obtained such 1.4-GHz maps with the 100-m Effelsberg telescope and combined them with the corresponding maps available from the NVSS. The aggregated data allow us to produce high-quality images, which can be used to obtain physical parameters of the mapped sources.

We show mathematically that in GRW theory (and similar theories) there are limitations to knowledge, that is, inhabitants of a GRW universe cannot find out all the facts true about their universe. As a specific example, they cannot accurately measure the number of collapses that a given physical system undergoes during a given time interval; in fact, they cannot reliably measure whether one or zero collapses occur. Put differently, in a GRW universe certain meaningful, factual questions are empirically undecidable. We discuss several types of limitations to knowledge and compare them with those in other (no-collapse) versions of quantum mechanics, such as Bohmian mechanics. Most of our results also apply to observer-induced collapses as in orthodox quantum mechanics (as opposed to the spontaneous collapses of GRW theory).",1

A direct detection of compact and bright radio cores embedded in sources that are classified as RQ can unambiguously determine whether a central AGN significantly contributes to the radio emission. We search for compact, high-surface-brightness radio cores in RQ AGNs that are caused unambiguously by AGN activity. We used the Australian Long Baseline Array to search for compact radio cores in four RQ AGNs located in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS). We also targeted four radio-loud (RL) AGNs as a control sample. We detected compact and bright radio cores in two AGNs that are classified as RQ and in one that is classified as RL. Two RL AGNs were not imaged because the quality of the observations was too poor. We report on a first direct evidence of radio cores in RQ AGNs at cosmological redshifts.

In this study, we report the first characterization of the efficiency of generation of correlated photon pairs emitted from a CuCl single crystal using the biexciton-resonance hyper-parametric scattering (RHPS) method which is the highly efficient method of generation of correlated photon pairs. In order to characterize the generation efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio of correlated photon pairs using this method, we investigated the excitation density dependence on the photon counting rate and coincidence counting rate under resonant excitation. The excitation density dependence shows that the power characteristics of the photon counting rates changes from linear to quadratic dependence of the excitation density. This behavior represents a superposition of contributions from correlated photon pairs and non-correlated photons. Photon counting signals in this study were recorded as time-tag data, which provide the photon counting rate and coincidence counting rate simultaneously, and improve the coincidence counting rate by the factor of 200 compared to that obtained in previous work [K. Edamatsu $\it{et\ al}$. Nature $\bf{431}$, 167-170 (2004)]. The analysis of the excitation density dependence shows that one photon-pair is produced by a pump pulse with $2 \times 10^6$ photons.

We shed some light on these questions using the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique to search for RQQs in the field of the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS). The extensive multi-wavelength coverage of the field (from radio to X-rays) was used to classify RQQs, and the milli-arcsecond resolution of VLBI provides a direct way to identify AGNs.

6231,0,"Uniformity of fuel target implosion in Heavy Ion Fusion In inertial confinement fusion the target implosion non-uniformity is introduced by a driver beams' illumination non-uniformity, a fuel target alignment error in a fusion reactor, the target fabrication defect, et al. For a steady operation of a fusion power plant the target implosion should be robust against the implosion non-uniformities. In this paper the requirement for the implosion uniformity is first discussed. The implosion uniformity should be less than a few percent. A study on the fuel hotspot dynamics is also presented and shows that the stagnating plasma fluid provides a significant enhancement of vorticity at the final stage of the fuel stagnation. Then non-uniformity mitigation mechanisms of the heavy ion beam (HIB) illumination are also briefly discussed in heavy ion inertial fusion (HIF). A density valley appears in the energy absorber, and the large-scale density valley also works as a radiation energy confinement layer, which contributes to a radiation energy smoothing. In HIF a wobbling heavy ion beam illumination was also introduced to realize a uniform implosion. In the wobbling HIBs illumination, the illumination non-uniformity oscillates in time and space on a HIF target. The oscillating-HIB energy deposition may contribute to the reduction of the HIBs' illumination non-uniformity by its smoothing effect on the HIB illumination non-uniformity and also by a growth mitigation effect on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.",1
6283,0,"Infrared Supernova Remnants and their Infrared to X-ray Flux Ratios Recent high-resolution infrared space missions have revealed supernova remnants (SNRs) of diverse morphology in infrared (IR) dust emission that is often very different from their X-ray appearance. The observed range of infrared-to-X-ray (IRX) flux ratios of SNRs are also wide. For a sample of 20 Galactic SNRs, we obtain their IR and X-ray properties and investigate the physical causes for such large differences. We find that the observed IRX flux ratios ($R_{IRX.obs}$) are related to the IRX morphology, with SNRs with the largest $R_{IRX,obs}$ showing anticorrelated IRX morphology. By analyzing the relation of $R_{IRX,obs}$ to X-ray and IR parameters, we show that the $R_{IRX,obs}$ of some SNRs agree with theoretical ratios of SNR shocks in which dust grains are heated and destroyed by collisions with plasma particles. For the majority of SNRs, however, $R_{IRX,obs}$ values are either significantly smaller or significantly larger than the theoretical ratios. The latter SNRs have relatively low dust temperatures. We discuss how the natural and/or environmental properties of SNRs could have affected the IRX flux ratios and the IRX morphology of these SNRs. We conclude that the SNRs with largest $R_{IRX,obs}$ are probably located in dense environment and that their IR emission is from dust heated by shock radiation rather than by collisions. Our result suggests that the IRX flux ratio, together with dust temperature, can be used to infer the nature of unresolved SNRs in external galaxies.",1
6303,0,"The multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for fermions: Implementation, exactness and application to few-fermion tunneling to open space We report on an implementation of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method (MCTDH) for spin-polarized fermions (MCTDHF). Our approach is based on a mapping for opera- tors in Fock space that allows a compact and efficient application of the Hamiltonian and solution of the MCTDHF equations of motion. Our implementation extends, builds on and exploits the recursive implementation of MCTDH for bosons (R-MCTDHB) package. Together with R-MCTDHB, the present implementation of MCTDHF forms the MCTDH-X package. We benchmark the accuracy of the algorithm with the harmonic interaction model and a time-dependent generalization thereof. These models consider parabolically trapped particles that interact through a harmonic interaction potential. We demonstrate, that MCTDHF is capable of solving the time-dependent many-fermion Schr\""odinger equation to an in principle arbitrary degree of precision and can hence yield numerically exact results even in the case of Hamiltonians with time-dependent one-body and two-body potentials. As an application we study the problem of two initially parabolically confined and charged fermions tunneling through a barrier to open space. We demonstrate the validity of a model proposed previously for the many-body tunneling to open space of bosonic particles with contact interactions [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 13521-13525 (2012)]. The many-fermion tunneling can be built up from sequentially happening single-fermion tunneling processes. The characteristic momenta of these processes are determined by the chemical potentials of trapped subsystems of smaller particle numbers: the escaped fermions convert the different chemical potentials into kinetic energy. Using the two-body correlation function, we present a detailed picture of the sequentiality of the process and are able to tell tunneling from over-the-barrier escape.",1

We propose that, at low temperature, kapellasite exhibits a gapless chiral spin liquid phase with spinon Fermi surfaces. This two-dimensional state inherits many properties of the nearby one-dimensional phase of decoupled anti-ferromagnetic spin chains, but also shows some remarkable differences. We discuss the spin structure factors and other physical properties.",1
6511,0,"Properties of Galaxies around AGNs with Most Massive Supermassive Black Hole Revealed by the Clustering Analysis We present results of the clustering analysis between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies at redshift 0.1-1.0 for investigating properties of galaxies associated with the AGNs, revealing the nature of fueling mechanism of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We used 8059 SDSS AGNs/QSOs for which virial masses of individual SMBHs were measured, and divided them into four mass groups. Cross-correlation analysis was performed and bias for each mass group was derived. The averaged color and luminosity distributions of galaxies around the AGNs/QSOs were also derived for each mass group. The galaxy color was estimated for SED constructed from a merged SDSS and UKIDSS catalog. The distributions of color and luminosity were derived by the subtraction method, which does not require redshift information of galaxies. The main results of this work are: (1) a bias increases by a factor two from the lower mass group to the highest mass group; (2) the environment around AGNs with the most massive SMBH (Mbh &gt; 10^9 Msun) is dominated by red sequence galaxies; (3) marginal indication of decline in luminosity function at dimmer side of M &gt; -19.5 mag is found for galaxies around AGNs with Mbh = 10^8.2 - 10^9 Msun and nearest redshift group (z=0.1-0.3). These results indicate that AGNs with the most massive SMBHs reside in haloes where large fraction of galaxies have been transited to the red sequence. The accretion of hot halo gas as well as recycled gas from evolving stars can be the most plausible mechanism to fuel the SMBHs above ~10^9 Msun.",1
6555,0,"RadioLensfit: Bayesian weak lensing measurement in the visibility domain Observationally, weak lensing has been served so far by optical surveys due to the much larger number densities of background galaxies achieved, which is typically by two to three orders of magnitude compared to radio. However, the high sensitivity of the new generation of radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will provide a density of detected galaxies that is comparable to that found at optical wavelengths, and with significant source shape measurements to make large area radio surveys competitive for weak lensing studies. This will lead weak lensing to become one of the primary science drivers in radio surveys too, with the advantage that they will access the largest scales in the Universe going beyond optical surveys, like LSST and Euclid, in terms of redshifts that are probed. RadioLensfit is an adaptation to radio data of ""lensfit"", a model-fitting approach for galaxy shear measurement, originally developed for optical weak lensing surveys. Its key advantage is working directly in the visibility domain, which is the natural approach to adopt with radio data, avoiding systematics due to the imaging process. We present results on galaxy shear measurements, including investigation of sensitivity to instrumental parameters such as the visibilities gridding size, based on simulations of individual galaxy visibilities performed by using SKA1-MID baseline configuration. We get an amplitude of the shear bias in the method comparable with SKA1 requirements for a population of galaxies with realistic flux and scalelength distributions estimated from the VLA SWIRE catalog.",1
6569,0,"Causality and quantum criticality in long-range lattice models Long-range quantum lattice systems often exhibit drastically different behavior than their short-range counterparts. In particular, because they do not satisfy the conditions for the Lieb-Robinson theorem, they need not have an emergent relativistic structure in the form of a light cone. Adopting a field-theoretic approach, we study the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions, and a fermionic model with long-range hopping and pairing terms, explore their critical and near-critical behavior, and characterize their response to local perturbations. We deduce the dynamic critical exponent, up to the two-loop order within the renormalization group theory, which we then use to characterize the emergent causal behavior. We show that beyond a critical value of the power-law exponent of the long-range couplings, the dynamics effectively becomes relativistic. Various other critical exponents describing correlations in the ground state, as well as deviations from a linear causal cone, are deduced for a wide range of the power-law exponent.",1
6598,0,"Chiral p-wave superconductivity in Sb(111) thin films close to Van Hove singularities We theoretically investigate the development of unconventional superconductivity in the Sb(111) thin film when its Fermi level is tuned to near type-II Van Hove singularities (VHS), which locate at non-time-reversal invariant momenta. Via patch renormalization group analysis, we show that the leading instability is a chiral p + ip-wave superconducting order. The origin of such pairing relies on the hexagonal structure of the VHS and strong spin-orbit coupling, resulting in the anisotropy of the electron-electron scattering to provide an attractive channel. Our study hence suggests that superconducting Sb thin films originated from VHS physics may host Majorana zero modes in the magnetic vortices and provides another application perspective to such material.",1
6599,0,"One-dimensional edge state transport in a topological Kondo insulator Topological insulators, with metallic boundary states protected against time-reversal-invariant perturbations, are a promising avenue for realizing exotic quantum states of matter including various excitations of collective modes predicted in particle physics, such as Majorana fermions and axions. According to theoretical predictions, a topological insulating state can emerge from not only a weakly interacting system with strong spin-orbit coupling, but also in insulators driven by strong electron correlations. The Kondo insulator compound SmB6 is an ideal candidate for realizing this exotic state of matter, with hybridization between itinerant conduction electrons and localized $f$-electrons driving an insulating gap and metallic surface states at low temperatures. Here we exploit the existence of surface ferromagnetism in SmB6 to investigate the topological nature of metallic surface states by studying magnetotransport properties at very low temperatures. We find evidence of one-dimensional surface transport with a quantized conductance value of $e^2/h$ originating from the chiral edge channels of ferromagnetic domain walls, providing strong evidence that topologically non-trivial surface states exist in SmB6.",1

6788,0,"Asteroid Discovery and Characterization with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be a ground-based, optical, all-sky, rapid cadence survey project with tremendous potential for discovering and characterizing asteroids. With LSST's large 6.5m diameter primary mirror, a wide 9.6 square degree field of view 3.2 Gigapixel camera, and rapid observational cadence, LSST will discover more than 5 million asteroids over its ten year survey lifetime. With a single visit limiting magnitude of 24.5 in r-band, LSST will be able to detect asteroids in the Main Belt down to sub-kilometer sizes. The current strawman for the LSST survey strategy is to obtain two visits (each visit being a pair of back-to-back 15s exposures) per field, separated by about 30 minutes, covering the entire visible sky every 3-4 days throughout the observing season, for ten years. The catalogs generated by LSST will increase the known number of small bodies in the Solar System by a factor of 10-100 times, among all populations. The median number of observations for Main Belt asteroids will be on the order of 200-300, with Near Earth Objects receiving a median of 90 observations. These observations will be spread among ugrizy bandpasses, providing photometric colors and allowing sparse lightcurve inversion to determine rotation periods, spin axes, and shape information. These catalogs will be created using automated detection software, the LSST Moving Object Processing System (MOPS), that will take advantage of the carefully characterized LSST optical system, cosmetically clean camera, and recent improvements in difference imaging. Tests with the prototype MOPS software indicate that linking detections (and thus discovery) will be possible at LSST depths with our working model for the survey strategy, but evaluation of MOPS and improvements in the survey strategy will continue. All data products and software created by LSST will be publicly available.",1
6791,0,"Dynamical friction for supersonic motion in a homogeneous gaseous medium The supersonic motion of gravitating objects through a gaseous medium constitutes a classical problem in theoretical astrophysics. Its application covers a broad range of objects and scales from planets up to galaxies. Especially the dynamical friction, caused by the forming wake behind the object, plays an important role for the dynamics of the system. To calculate the dynamical friction, standard formulae, based on linear theory are often used. It is our goal to check the general validity of these formulae and provide suitable expressions for the dynamical friction acting on the moving object, based on the basic physical parameters of the problem. We perform sequences of high resolution numerical studies of rigid bodies moving supersonically through a homogeneous medium, and calculate the total drag acting on the object, which is the sum of gravitational and hydro drag. We study cases without gravity with purely hydrodynamical drag, as well as gravitating objects. From the final equilibrium state of the simulations, we compute for gravitating objects the dynamical friction by direct numerical integration of the gravitational pull acting on the embedded object. The numerical experiments confirm the known scaling laws for the dependence of the dynamical friction on the basic physical parameters as derived in earlier semi-analytical studies. As a new important result we find that the shock's stand-off distance is revealed as the minimum spatial interaction scale of dynamical friction. Below this radius, the gas settles into a hydrostatic state, which causes no net gravitational pull onto the moving body. Finally, we derive an analytic estimate for the stand-off distance that can be used to calculate the dynamical friction force.",1
6864,0,"The History of Tidal Disruption Events in Galactic Nuclei The tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole (MBH) is thought to produce a transient luminous event. Such tidal disruption events (TDEs) may play an important role in the detection and characterization of MBHs and probe the properties and dynamics of their nuclear stellar clusters (NSCs) hosts. Previous studies estimated the recent rates of TDEs in the local universe. However, the long-term evolution of the rates throughout the history of the universe has been hardly explored. Here we consider the TDE history, using evolutionary models for the evolution of galactic nuclei. We use a 1D Fokker-Planck approach to explore the evolution of MBH-hosting NSCs, and obtain the disruption rates of stars during their evolution. We complement these with an analysis of TDEs history based on N-body simulation data, and find them to be comparable. We consider NSCs that are built-up from close-in star-formation (SF) or from SF/clusters-dispersal far-out, a few pc from the MBH. We also explore cases where primordial NSCs exist and later evolve through additional star-formation/cluster-dispersal processes. We study the dependence of the TDE history on the type of galaxy, as well as the dependence on the MBH mass. These provide several scenarios, with a continuous increase of the TDE rates over time for cases of far-out SF and a more complex behavior for the close-in SF cases. Finally, we integrate the TDE histories of the various scenarios to provide a total TDE history of the universe, which can be potentially probed with future large surveys (e.g. LSST).",1
6880,0,"Time evolution of two-dimensional quadratic Hamiltonians: A Lie algebraic approach We develop a Lie algebraic approach to systematically calculate the evolution operator of the generalized two-dimensional quadratic Hamiltonian with time-dependent coefficients. Although the development of the Lie algebraic approach presented here is mainly motivated by the two-dimensional quadratic Hamiltonian, it may be applied to investigate the evolution operators of any Hamiltonian having a dynamical algebra with a large number of elements. We illustrate the method by finding the propagator and the Heisenberg picture position and momentum operators for a two-dimensional charge subject to uniform and constant electro-magnetic fields.",1
6936,0,"A frequency determination method for digitized NMR signals We present a high precision frequency determination method for digitized NMR FID signals. The method employs high precision numerical integration rather than simple summation as in many other techniques. With no independent knowledge of the other parameters of a NMR FID signal (phase $\phi$, amplitude $A$, and transverse relaxation time $T_{2}$) this method can determine the signal frequency $f_{0}$ with a precision of $1/(8\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}T_{2}^{2})$ if the observation time $T$ is long enough. The method is especially convenient when the detailed shape of the observed FT NMR spectrum is not well defined. When $T_{2}$ is $+\infty$ and the signal becomes pure sinusoidal, the precision of the method is $3/(2\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}T^{2})$ which is one order more precise than a typical frequency counter. Analysis of this method shows that the integration reduces the noise by bandwidth narrowing as in a lock-in amplifier, and no extra signal filters are needed. For a pure sinusoidal signal we find from numerical simulations that the noise-induced error in this method reaches the Cramer-Rao Lower Band(CRLB) on frequency determination. For the damped sinusoidal case of most interest, the noise-induced error is found to be within a factor of 2 of CRLB when the measurement time $T$ is a few times larger than $T_{2}$.We discuss possible improvements for the precision of this method.",1
6954,0,"Innovative static spectropolarimeter concept for wide spectral ranges: tolerancing study Developing an efficient and robust polarimeter for wide spectral ranges and space applications is a main issue in many projects. As part of the UVMag consortium created to develop UV facilities in space (e.g. the Arago mission proposed to ESA), we are studying an innovative concept of polarimeter that is robust, simple, and efficient on a wide spectral range. The idea, based on the article by Sparks et al. (2012), is to use polarization scramblers to create a spatial modulation of the polarization. Along the height of the wedges of the scramblers, the thickness of the birefringent material crossed by the light, and thus the retardance, vary continuously. This variation creates an intensity modulation of the light related to the entrance polarization state. Analyzing this modulation with a linear polarizer, and dispersing the light spectrally in the orthogonal spatial direction, enables the measurement of the full Stokes vector over the entire spectrum. This determination is performed with a single-shot measurement and without any moving parts in the system. After a quick introduction to the concept and optical design, this article presents the tolerancing study of the optical bench using this spectropolarimeter. The impact of different error sources, such as, birefringence uncertainty or decenter of the wedges, is investigated.",1
6972,0,"The interplay between chemistry and nucleation in the formation of carbonaceous dust in supernova ejecta Core-collapse supernovae are considered to be important contributors to the primitive dust enrichment of the interstellar medium in the high-redshift universe. Theoretical models of dust formation in stellar explosions have so far provided controversial results and a generally poor fit to the observations of dust formation in local supernovae. We present a new methodology for the calculation of carbonaceous dust formation in young supernova remnants. Our new technique uses both the nucleation theory and a chemical reaction network to allow us to compute the dust growth beyond the molecular level as well as to consider chemical erosion of the forming grains. We find that carbonaceous dust forms efficiently in the core of the ejecta, but takes several years to condensate, longer than previously estimated. It forms unevenly and remains concentrated in the inner part of the remnant. These results support the role of core-collapse supernovae as dust factories and provide new insight on the observations of SN 1987A, in which large amounts of dust have been detected to form on a timescale of years after core collapse.",1
7062,0,"A string reaction coordinate for the folding of a polymer chain We investigate the crystallization mechanism of a single, flexible homopolymer chain with short range attractions. For a sufficiently narrow attractive well, the system undergoes a first-order like freezing transition from an expanded disordered coil to a compact crystalline state. Based on a maximum likelihood analysis of committor values computed for configurations obtained by Wang-Landau sampling, we construct a non-linear string reaction coordinate for the coil-to-crystal transition. In contrast to a linear reaction coordinate, the string reaction coordinate captures the effect of different degrees of freedom controlling different stages of the transition. Our analysis indicates that a combination of the energy and the global crystallinity parameter Q6 provide the most accurate measure for the progress of the transition. While the crystallinity parameter Q6 is most relevant in the initial stages of the crystallization, the later stages are dominated by a decrease in the potential energy.",1
7117,0,"One-dimensional two-orbital SU(N) ultracold fermionic quantum gases at incommensurate filling: a low-energy approach We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of two-orbital SU(N) fermionic models at incommensurate filling which are directly relevant to strontium and ytterbium ultracold atoms loading into a one-dimensional optical lattice. Using a low-energy approach that takes into account explicitly the SU(N) symmetry, we find that a spectral gap for the nuclear-spin degrees of freedom is formed for generic interactions. Several phases with one or two gapless modes are then stabilized which describe the competition between different density instabilities. In stark contrast to the N=2 case, no dominant pairing instabilities emerge and the leading superfluid one is rather formed from bound states of 2N fermions.",1
7174,0,"Mid- and far-infrared properties of Spitzer Galactic bubbles revealed by the AKARI all-sky surveys We have carried out a statistical study on the mid- and far-infrared (IR) properties of Galactic IR bubbles observed by Spitzer. Using the Spitzer 8 ${\mu}{\rm m}$ images, we estimated the radii and covering fractions of their shells, and categorized them into closed, broken and unclassified bubbles with our data analysis method. Then, using the AKARI all-sky images at wavelengths of 9, 18, 65, 90, 140 and 160 ${\mu}{\rm m}$, we obtained the spatial distributions and the luminosities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), warm and cold dust components by decomposing 6-band spectral energy distributions with model fitting. As a result, 180 sample bubbles show a wide range of the total IR luminosities corresponding to the bolometric luminosities of a single B-type star to many O-type stars. For all the bubbles, we investigated relationships between the radius, luminosities and luminosity ratios, and found that there are overall similarities in the IR properties among the bubbles regardless of their morphological types. In particular, they follow a power-law relation with an index of $\sim$3 between the total IR luminosity and radius, as expected from the conventional picture of the Str$\rm{\ddot{o}}$mgren sphere. The exceptions are large broken bubbles; they indicate higher total IR luminosities, lower fractional luminosities of the PAH emission, and dust heating sources located nearer to the shells. We discuss the implications of those differences for a massive star-formation scenario.",1
7190,0,"Sensitivity analysis of GSI based mechanical characterization of rock mass Recently, the rock mechanical and rock engineering designs and calculations are frequently based on Geological Strength Index (GSI) method, because it is the only system that provides a complete set of mechanical properties for design purpose. Both the failure criteria and the deformation moduli of the rock mass can be calculated with GSI based equations, which consists of the disturbance factor, as well. The aim of this paper is the sensitivity analysis of GSI and disturbance factor dependent equations that characterize the mechanical properties of rock masses. The survey of the GSI system is not our purpose. The results show that the rock mass strength calculated by the Hoek-Brown failure criteria and both the Hoek-Diederichs and modified Hoek-Diederichs deformation moduli are highly sensitive to changes of both the GSI and the D factor, hence their exact determination is important for the rock engineering design.",1

The dispersion relations correspond to a chiral metamaterial consisting of uncoupled single-resonance helical resonators. Using a field decomposition scheme and a general expression for the electromagnetic energy density in bi-anisotropic media, we calculate the Lorenz-Mie solution for the internal fields in a medium that is simultaneously magnetic and chiral. We also obtain an explicit analytical relation between the internal electromagnetic field and the absorption cross-section. This result is applied to demonstrate that strong chirality leads to an off-resonance field enhancement within weakly absorb.ing spheres.",1
7264,0,"The Impact of Molecular Gas on Mass Models of Nearby Galaxies We present CO velocity fields and rotation curves for a sample of nearby galaxies, based on data from the HERACLES survey. We combine our data with literature THINGS, SINGS and KINGFISH results to provide a comprehensive sample of mass models of disk galaxies inclusive of molecular gas. We compare the kinematics of the molecular (CO from HERACLES) and atomic (${\rm H{\scriptstyle I}}$ from THINGS) gas distributions to determine the extent to which CO may be used to probe the dynamics in the inner part of galaxies. In general, we find good agreement between the CO and ${\rm H{\scriptstyle I}}$ kinematics with small differences in the inner part of some galaxies. We add the contribution of the molecular gas to the mass models in our galaxies by using two different conversion factors $\mathrm{\alpha_{CO}}$ to convert CO luminosity to molecular gas mass surface density - the constant Milky Way value and the radially varying profiles determined in recent work based on THINGS, HERACLES and KINGFISH data. We study the relative effect that the addition of the molecular gas has upon the halo rotation curves for Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and the observationally motivated pseudo-isothermal halos. The contribution of the molecular gas varies for galaxies in our sample - for those galaxies where there is a substantial molecular gas content, using different values of $\mathrm{\alpha_{CO}}$ can result in significant differences to the relative contribution of the molecular gas and, hence, the shape of the dark matter halo rotation curves in the central regions of galaxies.",1

We detect CIV1548,1550 resonant doublet in emission, each component with FWHM ~&lt; 45 km/s, and redshifted by +51(+/-10)km/s relative to the systemic redshift.

7699,0,"Confocal laser scanning microscopy image correlation for nanoparticle flow velocimetry We present a new particle image correlation technique for resolving nanoparticle flow velocity using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The two primary issues that complicate nanoparticle scanning laser image correlation (SLIC) based velocimetry are (1) the use of diffusion dominated nanoparticles as flow tracers, which introduce a random decorrelating error into the velocity estimate, and (2) the effects of the scanning laser image acquisition, which introduces a bias error. To date, no study has quantified these errors or demonstrated a means to deal with them in SLIC velocimetry. In this work, we build upon the robust phase correlation (RPC) and existing methods of SLIC to quantify and mitigate these errors. First, we implement an ensemble RPC instead of using an ensemble standard cross correlation, and develop an SLIC optimal filter that maximizes the correlation strength in order to reliably and accurately detect the correlation peak representing the most probable average displacement of the nanoparticles. Secondly, we developed an analytical model of the SLIC measurement bias error due to image scanning of diffusion dominated tracer particles. We show that the bias error depends only on the ratio of the mean velocity of the tracer particles to that of the laser scanner and we use this model to correct the induced errors. We validated our technique using synthetic images and experimentally obtained SLIC images of nanoparticle flow through a micro-channel. Our technique reduced the error by up to a factor of ten compared to other SLIC algorithms for the images tested in this study. Moreover, our optimized RPC filter is reducing the number of image pairs required for the convergence of the ensemble correlation by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard cross correlation.",1

7890,0,"Transboundary Secondary Organic Aerosol in the Urban Air of Fukuoka, Japan To understand the influence of transboundary secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the urban air of Fukuoka, we conducted simultaneous field studies in December 2010 and March 2012 on Fukue Island and in the city of Fukuoka, representing a rural and an urban sites of western Japan. During the studies, organic aerosol in PM1.0 was analyzed by aerosol mass spectrometers. Independently, airborne total suspended particulate matter (TSP) was collected on filters, and low-volatile water soluble organic carbon (LV-WSOC) extracted from the TSP samples was analyzed by an elemental analyzer coupled with a high precision isotope ratio mass spectrometer for its concentration and stable carbon isotope ratio (d13C). Plots of LV-WSOC concentrations versus m/z 44 concentrations for the study in December 2010 showed high correlations (r2 &gt; 0.85), but different slopes between the two sites (0.58 microg microgC-1 at Fukuoka and 0.22 microg microgC-1 at Fukue), indicating additional contribution of m/z 44 from local sources. Because of this complex composition, evaluation of transboundary SOA was unsuccessful in this case study. In contrast, comparison of LV-WSOC concentrations with the m/z 44 concentrations during the study in March 2012 showed high correlations (r2 &gt; 0.91) with similar slopes (0.3 microg microgC-1) at both sites, indicating predominance of transboundary LV-WSOC. Furthermore, the plot of d13C of LV-WSOC as a function of m/z 44 fraction showed a systematic increasing trend, indicating SOA.

For compression times shorter than the transit time of a compressional Alfven wave across the plasma slab, results show the formation of two counter-propagating shock waves, leading to a highly non-uniform plasma density profile. Furthermore, the plasma slab displays large hydromagnetic like oscillations after the driving field has reached steady state. Peak compression is obtained when the two shocks collide in the mid-plane. At this instant, very large plasma heating is observed, and plasma $\beta$ is estimated to be about $1$. Although these results point out a densification mechanism quite different and more complex than initially envisioned, these features could possibly be advantageous in particle accelerators.",1
8058,0,"Classification of scalar third order ordinary differential equations linearizable via generalized contact transformations Whereas Lie had linearized scalar second order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by point transformations and later Chern had extended to the third order by using contact transformation, till recently no work had been done for higher order or systems of ODEs. Lie had found a unique class defined by the number of infinitesimal symmetry generators but the more general ODEs were not so classified. Recently classifications of higher order and systems of ODEs were provided. In this paper we relate contact symmetries of scalar ODEs with point symmetries of reduced systems. We define new type of transformations that build up this relation and obtain equivalence classes of scalar third order ODEs linearizable via these transformations. Four equivalence classes of such equations are seen to exist.",1
8204,0,"Disk Outflows and High-Luminosity True Type 2 AGN The absence of intrinsic broad line emission has been reported in a number of active galactic nuclei (AGN), including some with high Eddington ratios. Such ""true type 2 AGN"" are inherent to the disk-wind scenario for the broad line region: Broad line emission requires a minimal column density, implying a minimal outflow rate and thus a minimal accretion rate. Here we perform a detailed analysis of the consequences of mass conservation in the process of accretion through a central disk. The resulting constraints on luminosity are consistent with all the cases where claimed detections of true type 2 AGN pass stringent criteria, and predict that intrinsic broad line emission can disappear at luminosities as high as about 4x$10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and any Eddington ratio, though more detections can be expected at Eddington ratios below about 1%. Our results are applicable to every disk outflow model, whatever its details and whether clumpy or smooth, irrespective of the wind structure and its underlying dynamics. While other factors, such as changes in spectral energy distribution or covering factor, can affect the intensities of broad emission lines, within this scenario they can only produce true type 2 AGN of higher luminosity then those prescribed by mass conservation.",1

Besides, an analytical solution for electron diffraction in the asymptotic domain of large field amplitudes is obtained and a mathematical model in reduced dimensionality for the scattering amplitude in the Bragg regime is presented.

The overall agreement is strikingly good and already the first Born approximation yields good agreement between theory and experiment.

8333,0,"Dirty Weyl semimetals: Stability, phase transition and quantum criticality We study the stability of three-dimensional incompressible Weyl semimetals in the presence of random quenched charge impurities. Combining numerical analysis and scaling theory we show that in the presence of sufficiently weak randomness (i) Weyl semimetal remains stable, while (ii) double-Weyl semimetal gives rise to compressible diffusive metal where the mean density of states at zero energy is finite. At stronger disorder, Weyl semimetal undergoes a quantum phase transition and enter into a metallic phase. Mean density of states at zero energy serves as the order parameter and displays single-parameter scaling across such disorder driven quantum phase transition. We numerically determine various exponents at the critical point, which appear to be insensitive to the number of Weyl pairs. We also extract the extent of the quantum critical regime in disordered Weyl semimetal and the phase diagram of dirty double Weyl semimetal at finite energies.",1

8506,0,"New constraints on direct collapse black hole formation in the early Universe Direct collapse black holes (DCBH) have been proposed as a solution to the challenge of assembling supermassive black holes by $z&gt;6$ to explain the bright quasars observed at this epoch. The formation of a DCBH seed with $\rm M_{BH}\sim10^{4-5}\ \rm M_{\odot}$ requires a pristine atomic-cooling halo to be illuminated by an external radiation field that is sufficiently strong to entirely suppress H$_{2}$ cooling in the halo. Many previous studies have attempted to constrain the critical specific intensity that is likely required to suppress H$_{2}$ cooling, denoted as $J_{\rm crit}$. However, these studies have typically assumed that the incident external radiation field can be modeled with a black-body spectrum. Under this assumption, it is possible to derive a {unique} value for $J_{\rm crit}$ that depends only on the temperature of the black-body. In this study we consider a more realistic spectral energy distribution (SED) for the external source of radiation that depends entirely on its star formation history and age. The rate of destruction of the species responsible for suppressing molecular hydrogen cooling depends on the detailed shape of the SED. Therefore the value of $J_{\rm crit}$ is tied to the shape of the incident SED of the neighbouring galaxy. We fit a parametric form to the rates of destruction of H$_2$ and H$^-$ that permit direct collapse. Owing to this, we find that $J_{\rm crit}$ is not a fixed threshold but can lie anywhere in the range $J_{\rm crit} \sim 0.5$--$10^{3}$, depending on the details of the source stellar population.",1

8768,0,"Gauge Invariant Linear Response Theories for Ultracold Fermi Gases with Pseudogap Recent experimental progresses allow for exploring some important physical quantities of ultracold Fermi gases, such as the compressibility, spin susceptibility, viscosity, optical conductivity and spin diffusivity. Theoretically, these quantities can be evaluated from suitable linear response theories. For BCS superfluid, it has been found that the gauge invariant linear response theories can be fully consistent with some stringent consistency constraints. When the theory is generalized to stronger-than-BCS regime, one may meet serious difficulties to satisfy the gauge invariance conditions. In this paper, we try to construct density and spin linear response theories which are formally gauge invariant for a Fermi gas undergoing BCS-Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) crossover, especially below the superfluid transition temperature $T_c$. We adapt a particular $t$-matrix approach which is close to the $G_0G$ formalism to incorporate non-condensed pairing in the normal state. We explicitly show that the fundamental constraints imposed by the Ward identities, $Q$-limit Ward identity are indeed satisfied.",1
8864,0,"Multiscale Analysis of the Gradient of Linear Polarisation We propose a new multiscale method to calculate the amplitude of the gradient of the linear polarisation vector using a wavelet-based formalism. We demonstrate this method using a field of the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) and show that the filamentary structure typically seen in gradients of linear polarisation maps depends strongly on the instrumental resolution. Our analysis reveals that different networks of filaments are present on different angular scales. The wavelet formalism allows us to calculate the power spectrum of the fluctuations seen in gradients of linear polarisation maps and to determine the scaling behaviour of this quantity. The power spectrum is found to follow a power law with gamma ~ 2.1. We identify a small drop in power between scales of 80 &lt; l &lt; 300 arcmin, which corresponds well to the overlap in the u-v plane between the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and the DRAO 26-m telescope data. We suggest that this drop is due to undersampling present in the 26-m telescope data. In addition, the wavelet coefficient distributions show higher skewness on smaller scales than at larger scales. The spatial distribution of the outliers in the tails of these distributions creates a coherent subset of filaments correlated across multiple scales, which trace the sharpest changes in the polarisation vector P within the field. We suggest that these structures may be associated with highly compressive shocks in the medium. The power spectrum of the field excluding these outliers shows a steeper power law with gamma ~ 2.5.",1

We have considered various clusters of average sizes ($\langle R_0\rangle$=80,140,200\AA) which are irradiated by a laser of peak spatial-temporal intensity of 1$\times10^{18} W/cm^{2}$. The effects of cluster size and spatial laser intensity distribution on ion energies due to the Coulomb explosion of the cluster are included by convolution of single cluster single intensity ion energy distribution function (IEDF) over a range of cluster sizes and laser intensities. The final convoluted IEDF gets broadened on both lower and higher energy sides due to this procedure. Furthermore, the neutron yield which takes into account the convoluted IEDF, also gets modified by a factor of $\sim$2 compared to the case when convolution effects are ignored.",1
9143,0,"Donaldson-Thomas trasnsformations of moduli spaces of G-local systems Kontsevich and Soibelman defined Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3d Calabi-Yau category equipped with a stability condition. Any cluster variety gives rise to a family of such categories. Their DT invariants are encapsulated in a single formal automorphism of the cluster variety, called the DT-transformation. Let S be an oriented surface with punctures, and a finite number of special points on the boundary considered modulo isotopy. It give rise to a moduli space X(m, S), closely related to the moduli space of PGL(m)-local systems on S, which carries a canonical cluster Poisson variety structure. For each puncture of S, there is a birational Weyl group action on the space X(m, S). We prove that it is given by cluster Poisson transformations. We prove a similar result for the involution * of the space X(m,S) provided by dualising a local system on S. We calculate the DT-transformation of the moduli space X(m,S), with few exceptions. Namely, let C(m,S) be the transformation of the space X(m,S) given by the product of three commuting maps: the involution *, the product, over all punctures of S, of the longest element of the Weyl group action corresponding to the puncture, and the ""shift of the special points on the boundary by one"" map. Using a characterisation of a class of DT-transformations due to Keller, we prove that C(m,S) = DT. We prove that, burring few exceptions, the Weyl group and the involution * act by cluster transformations of the dual moduli space A(m, S). So the formula C(m,S) = DT is valid for the space A(m,S). Our main result, combined with the work of Gross, Hacking, Keel and Kontsevich, deliver a canonical basis in the space of regular functions on the cluster variety X(m,S), and in the upper cluster algebra with principal coefficients related to the pair (SL(m), S), with few exceptions.",1

Massless Dirac electrons emerge on a side surface of WTIs as a consequence of the hybridization of such helical edge modes. We study the energy spectrum and transport of Dirac electrons on a side surface in the presence of step edges, which significantly modify the way of hybridization. It is shown that pseudo-helical modes with a nearly gapless linear dispersion can be created by manipulating step edges in a certain manner. We numerically calculate the average conductance of weakly disordered WTIs and show that it is markedly enhanced by pseudo-helical modes.",1
9288,0,"A Versatile Family of Galactic Wind Models We present a versatile family of model galactic outflows including non-uniform mass and energy source distributions, a gravitational potential from an extended mass source, and radiative losses. The model easily produces steady-state wind solutions for a range of mass-loading factors, energy-loading factors, galaxy mass and galaxy radius. We find that, with radiative losses included, highly mass-loaded winds must be driven at high central temperatures, whereas low mass-loaded winds can be driven at low temperatures just above the peak of the cooling curve, meaning radiative losses can drastically affect the wind solution even for low mass-loading factors. By including radiative losses, we are able to show that subsonic flows can be ignored as a possible mechanism for expelling mass and energy from a galaxy compared to the more efficient transonic solutions. Specifically, the transonic solutions with low mass-loading and high energy-loading are the most efficient. Our model also produces low-temperature, high-velocity winds that could explain the prevalence of low-temperature material in observed outflows. Finally, we show that our model, unlike the well-known Chevalier &amp; Clegg (1985) model, can reproduce the observed linear relationship between wind X-ray luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) over a large range of SFR from $1-1000$ M$_{\odot}$/yr assuming the wind mass-loading factor is higher for low-mass, and hence, low-SFR galaxies. We also constrain the allowed mass-loading factors that can fit the observed X-ray luminosity vs. SFR trend, further suggesting an inverse relationship between mass-loading and SFR as explored in advanced numerical simulations.",1
9305,0,"Rapid, broadband spectroscopic temperature measurement of CO2 using VIPA spectroscopy Time-resolved spectroscopic temperature measurements of a sealed carbon dioxide sample cell were realized with an optical frequency comb combined with a two-dimensional dispersive spectrometer. A supercontinuum laser source based on an erbium fiber mode-locked laser was employed to generate coherent light around 2000 nm (5000 cm-1). The laser was passed through a 12-cm long cell containing CO2, and the transmitted light was analyzed in a virtually imaged phased array- (VIPA-) based spectrometer. Broadband spectra spanning more than 100 cm-1 with a spectral resolution of roughly 0.075 cm-1 (2.2 GHz) were acquired with an integration period of 2 ms. The temperature of the CO2 sample was deduced from fitting a modeled spectrum to the line intensities of the experimentally acquired spectrum. Temperature dynamics on the time scale of milliseconds were observed with a temperature resolution of 2.6 K. The spectroscopically-deduced temperatures agreed with temperatures of the sample cell measured with a thermistor. Potential applications of this technique include quantitative measurement of carbon dioxide concentration and temperature dynamics in gas-phase chemical reactions (e.g., combustion), and plasma diagnostics.",1

9465,0,"Long-range Coulomb interaction in nodal-ring semimetals Recently there have been several proposals of materials predicted to be nodal-ring semimetals, where zero energy excitations are characterized by a nodal ring in the momentum space. This class of materials falls between the Dirac-like semimetals and the more conventional Fermi-surface systems. As a step towards understanding this unconventional system, we explore the effects of the long-range Coulomb interaction. Due to the vanishing density of states at the Fermi level, Coulomb interaction is only partially screened and remains long-ranged. Through renormalization group and large-$N_f$ computations, we have identified a nontrivial interacting fixed point. The screened Coulomb interaction at the interacting fixed point is an irrelevant perturbation, allowing controlled perturbative evaluations of physical properties of quasiparticles. We discuss unique experimental consequences of such quasiparticles: acoustic wave propagation, anisotropic dc conductivity, and renormalized phonon dispersion as well as energy dependence of quasiparticle lifetime.",1

9835,0,"Bialgebras, the classical Yang-Baxter equation and Manin triples for 3-Lie algebras This paper studies two types of 3-Lie bialgebras whose compatibility conditions between the multiplication and comultiplication are given by local cocycles and double constructions respectively, and are therefore called the local cocycle 3-Lie bialgebra and the double construction 3-Lie bialgebra. They can be regarded as suitable extensions of the well-known Lie bialgebra in the context of 3-Lie algebras, in two different directions. The local cocycle 3-Lie bialgebra is introduced to extend the connection between Lie bialgebras and the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Its relationship with a ternary variation of the classical Yang-Baxter equation, called the 3-Lie classical Yang-Baxter equation, a ternary $\mathcal{O}$-operator and a 3-pre-Lie algebra is established. In particular, it is shown that solutions of the 3-Lie classical Yang-Baxter equation give (coboundary) local cocycle 3-Lie bialgebras, whereas 3-pre-Lie algebras give rise to solutions of the 3-Lie classical Yang-Baxter equation. The double construction 3-Lie bialgebra is introduced to extend to the 3-Lie algebra context the connection between Lie bialgebras and double constructions of Lie algebras. Their related Manin triples give a natural construction of pseudo-metric 3-Lie algebras with neutral signature. Moreover, the double construction 3-Lie bialgebra can be regarded as a special class of the local cocycle 3-Lie bialgebra. Explicit examples of double construction 3-Lie bialgebras are provided.",1
9920,0,"Cancer and electromagnetic radiation therapy: Quo Vadis? In oncology, treating cancer with a beam of photons is a well established therapeutic technique, developed over 100 years, and today over 50% of cancer patients will undergo traditional X-ray radiotherapy. However, ionizing radiation therapy is not the only option, as the high-energy photons delivering their cell-killing radiation energy into cancerous tumor can lead to significant damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, located throughout the beam's path. Therefore, in nowadays, advances in ionizing radiation therapy are competitive to non-ionizing ones, as for example the laser light based therapy, resulting in a synergism that has revolutionized medicine. The use of non-invasive or minimally invasive (e.g. through flexible endoscopes) therapeutic procedures in the management of patients represents a very interesting treatment option. Moreover, as the major breakthrough in cancer management is the individualized patient treatment, new biophotonic techniques, e.g. photo-activated drug carriers, help the improvement of treatment efficacy and/or normal tissue toxicity. Additionally, recent studies support that laser technology progresses could revolutionize cancer proton therapy, by reducing the cost of the needed installations.

9995,0,"Constraining the subgrid physics in simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies Simulating dwarf galaxy halos in a reionizing Universe puts severe constraints on the sub-grid model employed in the simulations. Using the same sub-grid model that works for simulations without a UV-background (UVB) results in gas poor galaxies that stop forming stars very early on, except for halos with high masses. This is in strong disagreement with observed galaxies, which are gas rich and star forming down to a much lower mass range. To resolve this discrepancy, we ran a large suite of isolated dwarf galaxy simulations to explore a wide variety of sub-grid models and parameters, including timing and strength of the UVB, strength of the stellar feedback, and metallicity dependent Pop III feedback. We compared these simulations to observed dwarf galaxies by means of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), which links the baryonic content of a galaxy to the observationally determined strength of its gravitational potential. We found that the results are robust to changes in the UVB. The strength of the stellar feedback shifts the results on the BTFR, but does not help to form gas rich galaxies at late redshifts. Only by including Pop III feedback are we able to produce galaxies that lie on the observational BTFR and that have neutral gas and ongoing star formation at redshift zero.",1

The system is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that encircles an exceptional point in momentum space. The winding number has a fractional value of 1/2. There is only one dynamically stable zero-energy edge state due to the defectiveness of the Hamiltonian. This edge state is robust to disorder due to protection by a chiral symmetry.

10588,0,"Monte Carlo Method for Calculating Oxygen Abundances and Their Uncertainties from Strong-Line Flux Measurements We present the open-source Python code pyMCZ that determines oxygen abundance and its distribution from strong emission lines in the standard metallicity calibrators, based on the original IDL code of Kewley &amp; Dopita (2002) with updates from Kewley &amp; Ellison (2008), and expanded to include more recently developed calibrators. The standard strong-line diagnostics have been used to estimate the oxygen abundance in the interstellar medium through various emission line ratios in many areas of astrophysics, including galaxy evolution and supernova host galaxy studies. We introduce a Python implementation of these methods that, through Monte Carlo sampling, better characterizes the statistical oxygen abundance confidence region including the effect due to the propagation of observational uncertainties. These uncertainties are likely to dominate the error budget in the case of distant galaxies, hosts of cosmic explosions. Given line flux measurements and their uncertainties, our code produces synthetic distributions for the oxygen abundance in up to 15 metallicity calibrators simultaneously, as well as for E(B-V), and estimates their median values and their 68% confidence regions. We test our code on emission line measurements from a sample of nearby supernova host galaxies (z &lt; 0.15) and compare our metallicity results with those from previous methods. Our metallicity estimates are consistent with previous methods but yield smaller statistical uncertainties. Systematic uncertainties are not taken into account. We offer visualization tools to assess the spread of the oxygen abundance in the different calibrators, as well as the shape of the estimated oxygen abundance distribution in each calibrator, and develop robust metrics for determining the appropriate Monte Carlo sample size. The code is open access and open source and can be found at https://github.com/nyusngroup/pyMCZ (Abridged)",1

Moreover, we find that the Weyl nodes with opposite charges are located at different energies due to the absence of mirror symmetry in SrSi$_2$, leading to a unique topological quantum response that an external magnetic field can induce a dissipationless current. Our systematic results not only identify a much-needed robust Weyl semimetal candidate but also open the door to new topological Weyl physics that is not possible in the TaAs family of materials.",1

The reduced models we construct depend on coefficients which measure the importance of the different terms appearing in the model and need to be estimated. The proposed approach allows the estimation of these coefficients on the fly by enforcing the equality of integral quantities of the solution as computed from the original system and the reduced model. In particular, the approach combines the concepts of renormalization and effective field theory developed in the context of high energy physics and the Mori-Zwanzig formalism of irreversible statistical mechanics. It allows to construct stable reduced models of higher order than was previously possible. The method is applied to the problem of computing reduced models for ordinary differential equation systems resulting from Fourier expansions of singular (or near-singular) time-dependent partial differential equations. Results for the 1D Burgers and the 3D incompressible Euler equations are used to illustrate the construction.

However, many students struggle with the basic operating principles of a lock-in amplifier which can lead to a variety of difficulties. To improve students' understanding, we have been developing and evaluating a research-based tutorial which makes use of a computer simulation of a lock-in amplifier. The tutorial allows students to realize their conceptual difficulties by comparing their predictions about how a lock-in amplifier will behave with the outcome of simulated experiments. After being confronted with discrepancies between their predictions and the lock-in amplifier results, the tutorial targets the common difficulties that students have and leads them to develop a deeper understanding of the principles of lock-in amplification.",1
11441,0,"Real-Time Dedispersion for Fast Radio Transient Surveys, using Auto Tuning on Many-Core Accelerators Dedispersion, the removal of deleterious smearing of impulsive signals by the interstellar matter, is one of the most intensive processing steps in any radio survey for pulsars and fast transients. We here present a study of the parallelization of this algorithm on many-core accelerators, including GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA, and the Intel Xeon Phi. We find that dedispersion is inherently memory-bound. Even in a perfect scenario, hardware limitations keep the arithmetic intensity low, thus limiting performance. We next exploit auto-tuning to adapt dedispersion to different accelerators, observations, and even telescopes. We demonstrate that the optimal settings differ between observational setups, and that auto-tuning significantly improves performance. This impacts time-domain surveys from Apertif to SKA.",1
11493,0,"Environmental dependence of the HI mass function in the ALFALFA 70% catalogue We search for environmental dependence of the HI mass function in the ALFALFA 70% catalogue. The catalogue is split into quartiles of environment density based on the projected neighbour density of neighbours found in both SDSS and 2MRS volume limited reference catalogues. We find the Schechter function 'knee' mass to be dependent on environment, with the value of $\log ({M_{*}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}})$ shifting from $9.81 \pm 0.02$ to $10.00 \pm 0.03$ between the lowest and highest density quartiles. However, this dependence was only observed when defining environment based on the SDSS reference catalogue, not 2MRS. We interpret these results as meaning that the local environment is the dominant cause of the shift in $M_{*}$, and that the larger scales that 2MRS probes (compared to SDSS) are almost irrelevant. In addition, we also use a fixed aperture method to probe environment, and find tentative evidence that HI-deficiency depresses the value of $M_{*}$ in the highest density regions. We find no significant dependence of the low-mass slope on environment in any test, using either method. Tensions between these results and those from the literature, are discussed and alternative explanations are explored.",1
11537,0,"ASIC-based Implementation of Synchronous Section-Carry Based Carry Lookahead Adders The section-carry based carry lookahead adder (SCBCLA) topology was proposed as an improved high-speed alternative to the conventional carry lookahead adder (CCLA) topology in previous works. Self-timed and FPGA-based implementations of SCBCLAs and CCLAs were considered earlier, and it was found that SCBCLAs could help in delay reduction i.e. pave the way for improved speed compared to CCLAs at the expense of some increase in area and/or power parameters. In this work, we consider semi-custom ASIC-based implementations of different variants of SCBCLAs and CCLAs to perform 32-bit dual-operand addition. Based on the simulation results for 32-bit dual-operand addition obtained by targeting a high-end 32/28nm CMOS process, it is found that an optimized SCBCLA architecture reports a 9.8% improvement in figure-of-merit (FOM) compared to an optimized CCLA architecture, where the FOM is defined as the inverse of the product of power, delay, and area. It is generally inferred from the simulations that the SCBCLA architecture could be more beneficial compared to the CCLA architecture in terms of the design metrics whilst benefitting a variety of computer arithmetic operations involving dual-operand and/or multi-operand additions. Also, it is observed that heterogeneous CLA architectures tend to fare well compared to homogeneous CLA architectures, as substantiated by the simulation results.",1
11577,0,"Vlasov Simulations of Electron-Ion Collision Effects on Damping of Electron Plasma Waves Collisional effects can play an essential role in the dynamics of plasma waves by setting a minimum damping rate and by interfering with wave-particle resonances. Kinetic simulations of the effects of electron-ion pitch angle scattering on Electron Plasma Waves (EPWs) are presented here. In particular, the effects of such collisions on the frequency and damping of small-amplitude EPWs for a range of collision rates and wave phase velocities are computed and compared with theory. Both the Vlasov simulations and linear kinetic theory find the direct contribution of electron-ion collisions to wave damping is about a factor of two smaller than is obtained from linearized fluid theory. To our knowledge, this simple result has not been published before. Simulations have been carried out using a grid-based (Vlasov) approach, based on a high-order conservative finite difference method for discretizing the Fokker-Planck equation describing the evolution of the electron distribution function. Details of the implementation of the collision operator within this framework are presented. Such a grid-based approach, which is not subject to numerical noise, is of particular interest for the accurate measurements of the wave damping rates.",1
11599,0,"Local orbital angular momentum revealed by spiral phase plate imaging in transmission electron microscopy The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light and matter waves is a parameter that is getting increasingly more attention over the past couple of years. Beams with a well defined OAM, the so-called vortex beams, are applied already in e.g. telecommunication, astrophysics, nanomanipulation and chiral measurements in optics and electron microscopy. Also the OAM of a wave induced by the interaction with a sample, shows great potential of interest. In all these experiments it is crucial to measure the exact (local) OAM content of the wave, whether it is an incoming vortex beam or an exit wave after interacting with a sample. In this work we investigate the use of spiral phase plates as an alternative to the programmable phase plates used in optics to measure OAM. We derive analytically how these can be used to study the local OAM components of any wave function. By means of numerical simulations we illustrate how the OAM of a pure vortex beam can be measured. We also look at a sum of misaligned vortex beams and show how using SPPs the position and the OAM of each individual beam can be detected. Finally we look at the OAM induced by a magnetic dipole on a free electron wave and show how the SPP can be used to localize the magnetic poles and measure their ""magnetic charge"". Although our findings can be applied to study the OAM of any wave function, they are of particular interest for electron microscopy where versatile programmable phase plates do not yet exist.",1
11676,0,"Hierarchy of Floquet gaps and edge states for driven honeycomb lattices Electromagnetic driving in a honeycomb lattice can induce gaps and topological edge states with a structure of increasing complexity as the frequency of the driving lowers. While the high frequency case is the most simple to analyze we focus on the multiple photon processes allowed in the low frequency regime to unveil the hierarchy of Floquet edge-states. In the case of low intensities an analytical approach allows us to derive effective Hamiltonians and address the topological character of each gap in a constructive manner. At high intensities we obtain the net number of edge states, given by the winding number, with a numerical calculation of the Chern numbers of each Floquet band. Using these methods, we find a hierarchy that resembles that of a Russian nesting doll. This hierarchy classifies the gaps and the associated edge states in different orders according to the electron-photon coupling strength. For large driving intensities, we rely on the numerical calculation of the winding number, illustrated in a map of topological phase transitions. The hierarchy unveiled with the low energy effective Hamiltonians, alongside with the map of topological phase transitions discloses the complexity of the Floquet band structure in the low frequency regime. The proposed method for obtaining the effective Hamiltonian can be easily adapted to other Dirac Hamiltonians of two dimensional materials and even the surface of a 3D topological insulator.",1

11828,0,"Numerical solution of the stationary multicomponent nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation with a constraint on the angular momentum We formulate a damped oscillating particle method to solve the stationary nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NLSE). The ground state solutions are found by a converging damped oscillating evolution equation that can be discretized with symplectic numerical techniques. The method is demonstrated for three different cases: for the single-component NLSE with an attractive self-interaction, for the single-component NLSE with a repulsive self interaction and a constraint on the angular momentum, and for the two-component NLSE with a constraint on the total angular momentum. We reproduce the so called yrast curve for the single-component case, described in [A. D. Jackson et al., Europhys. Lett. 95, 30002 (2011)], and produce for the first time an analogous curve for the two-component NLSE. The numerical results are compared with analytic solutions and competing numerical methods. Our method is well suited to handle a large class of equations and can easily be adapted to further constraints and components.",1

11943,0,"[O III] line properties in two samples of radio-emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies The [O III] $\lambda\lambda$ 4959,5007 lines are a useful proxy to test the kinematic of the narrow-line region (NLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). In AGN, and particularly in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) these lines often show few peculiar features, such as blue wings, often interpreted as outflowing component, and a shift $-$ typically toward lower wavelengths $-$ of the whole spectroscopic feature in some exceptional sources, the so-called blue outliers, which are often associated to strong winds. We investigated the incidence of these peculiarities in two samples of radio-emitting NLS1s, one radio-loud and one radio-quiet. We also studied a few correlations between the observational properties of the [O III] lines and those of the AGN. Our aim was to understand the difference between radio-quiet and radio-loud NLS1s, which may in turn provide useful information on the jet formation mechanism. We find that the NLR gas is much more perturbed in radio-loud than in radio-quiet NLS1s. In particular the NLR dynamics in $\gamma$-ray emitting NLS1s appears to be highly disturbed, and this might be a consequence of interaction with the relativistic jet. The less frequently perturbed NLR in radio-quiet NLS1s suggests instead that these sources likely do not harbor a fully developed relativistic jet. Nonetheless blue-outliers in radio-quiet NLS1s are observed, and we interpret them as a product of strong winds.",1

We found that a Majorana fermion exists at the vortex core in the phase with zero first Chern number and does not exist at the phase with non-trivial first Chern number. This result is supported by the index theorem. This system provides an example in which a Majorana fermion emerges in a system with zero first Chern number.,1

12212,0,"Resolved Companions of Cepheids: Testing the Candidates with X-Ray Observations We have made {\it XMM-Newton\/} observations of 14 Galactic Cepheids that have candidate resolved ($\geq$5$\arcsec$) companion stars based on our earlier {\it HST\/} WFC3 imaging survey. Main-sequence stars that are young enough to be physical companions of Cepheids are expected to be strong X-ray producers in contrast to field stars. {\it XMM-Newton\/} exposures were set to detect essentially all companions hotter than spectral type M0 (corresponding to 0.5 $ M_\odot$.) The large majority of our candidate companions were not detected in X-rays, and hence are not confirmed as young companions. One resolved candidate (S~Nor \#4) was unambiguously detected, but the Cepheid is a member of a populous cluster. For this reason, it is likely that S~Nor \#4 is a cluster member rather than a gravitationally bound companion. Two further Cepheids (S~Mus and R~Cru) have X-ray emission that might be produced by either the Cepheid or the candidate resolved companion. A subsequent {\it Chandra} observation of S Mus shows that the X-rays are at the location of the Cepheid/spectroscopic binary. R Cru and also V659 Cen (also X-ray bright) have possible companions closer than 5$\arcsec$ (the limit for this study) which are the likely source of X-rays. One final X-ray detection (V473 Lyr) has no known optical companion, so the prime suspect is the Cepheid itself. It is a unique Cepheid with a variable amplitude.",1

The Hall conductance becomes maximum when a skyrmion is at the lead position. It is possible to detect the skyrmion position even at room temperature.

We find that the local density of states become minimum at the skyrmion position. Our results will be a basis of future skyrmion electronics.",1
12498,0,"The Scientific and Historical Value of Annotations on Astronomical Photographic Plates The application of photography to astronomy was a critical step in the development of astrophysics at the end of the nineteenth century. Using custom-built photographic telescopes and objective prisms, astronomers took images of the sky on glass plates during a 100-year period from many observing stations around the globe. After each plate was developed, astronomers and their assistants studied and annotated the plates as they made astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic measurements, counted galaxies, observed stellar variability, tracked meteors, and calculated the ephemerides of asteroids and comets. In this paper, the authors assess the importance of the plate annotations for future scientific, historical, and educational programs. Unfortunately, many of these interesting annotations are now being erased when grime is removed from the plates before they are digitized to make the photometric data available for time-domain astrophysics. To see what professional astronomers and historians think about this situation, the authors conducted a survey. This paper captures the lively discussion on the pros and cons of the removal of plate markings, how to best to document them if they must be cleaned off, and what to do with plates whose annotations are deemed too valuable to be erased. Three appendices to the paper offer professional guidance on the best practices for handling and cleaning the plates, photographing any annotations, and rehousing them.",1

12819,0,"Semiclassical evolution of correlations between observables The trace of an arbitrary product of quantum operators with the density operator is rendered as a multiple phase space integral of the product of their Weyl symbols with the Wigner function. Interspersing the factors with various evolution operators, one obtains an evolving correlation. The kernel for the matching multiple integral that evolves within the Weyl representation is identified with the trace of a single compound unitary operator. Its evaluation within a semiclassical approximation then becomes a sum over the periodic trajectories of the corresponding classical compound canonical transformation. The search for periodic trajectories can be bypassed by an exactly equivalent initial value scheme, which involves a change of integration variable and a reduced compound unitary operator. Restriction of all the operators to observables with smooth non-oscillatory Weyl symbols reduces the evolving correlation to a single phase space integral. If each observable undergoes independent Heisenberg evolution, the overall correlation evolves classically. Otherwise, the kernel acquires a nonclassical phase factor, though it still depends on a purely classical compound trajectory: e.g. the fase for a double return of the quantum Loschmidt echo does not coincide with twice the phase for a single echo.",1
12857,0,"Wireless distance estimation with low-power standard components in wireless sensor nodes In the context of increasing use of moving wireless sensor nodes the interest in localizing these nodes in their application environment is strongly rising. For many applications, it is necessary to know the exact position of the nodes in two- or three-dimensional space. Commonly used nodes use state-of-the-art transceivers like the CC430 from Texas Instruments with integrated signal strength measurement for this purpose. This has the disadvantage, that the signal strength measurement is strongly dependent on the orientation of the node through the antennas inhomogeneous radiation pattern as well as it has a small accuracy on long ranges. Also, the nodes overall attenuation and output power has to be calibrated and interference and multipath effects appear in closed environments. Another possibility to trilaterate the position of a sensor node is the time of flight measurement. This has the advantage, that the position can also be estimated on long ranges, where signal strength methods give only poor accuracy. In this paper we present an investigation of the suitability of the state-of-the-art transceiver CC430 for a system based on time of flight methods and give an overview of the optimal settings under various circumstances for the in-field application. For this investigation, the systematic and statistical errors in the time of flight measurements with the CC430 have been investigated under a multitude of parameters. Our basic system does not use any additional components but only the given standard hardware, which can be found on the Texas Instruments evaluation board for a CC430. Thus, it can be implemented on already existent sensor node networks by a simple software upgrade.",1

12902,0,"Intermediate luminosity optical transients during the grazing envelope evolution (GEE) By comparing photon diffusion time with gas outflow time, I argue that a large fraction of the energy carried by the jets during the grazing envelope evolution (GEE) might end in radiation, hence leading to an intermediate luminosity optical transient (ILOT). In the GEE a companion orbiting near the outskirts of the larger primary star accretes mass through an accretion disk, and launches jets that efficiently remove the envelope gas from the vicinity of the secondary star. In cases of high mass accretion rates onto the stellar companion the energy carried by the jets surpass the recombination energy from the ejected mass, and when the primary star is a giant this energy surpasses also the gravitational binding energy of the binary system. Some future ILOTs of giant stars might be better explained by the GEE than by merger and common envelope evolution without jets.",1
12969,0,"Topological Order Parameters of the Spin-1/2 Dimerized Heisenberg Ladder in Magnetic Field Topological properties of the spin-1/2 dimerized Heisenberg ladder are investigated focusing on the plateau phase in the magnetic field whose magnetization is half of the saturation value. Although the applied magnetic field removes most of the symmetries of the system, there is a symmetry protected topological phase supported by the spatial inversion symmetry. The Z_2 Berry phase associated with a symmetry respecting boundary and quantized into 0 and \pi is used as a symmetry protected topological order parameter. Edge states are also analyzed to confirm the bulk-edge correspondence. In addition, a symmetry breaking boundary is considered. Then, we observe a unique type of quantization of the Berry phase, a quantization into +-\pi/2 of the Berry phase. In this case, the bulk-edge correspondence is also unique, namely, there emerge ""polarized"" edge states for the case with +-\pi/2 quantization. We also evaluate the entanglement entropy by the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) to complement the Berry phase based arguments. Further, a different type of the topological order parameter is extracted from the matrix product state representation of the ground state given by the iTEBD.",1
12982,0,"A novel look at energy equipartition in globular clusters Two-body interactions play a major role in shaping the structural and dynamical properties of globular clusters (GCs) over their long-term evolution. In particular, GCs evolve toward a state of partial energy equipartition that induces a mass-dependence in their kinematics. By using a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations evolved in quasi-isolation, we show that the stellar mass dependence of the velocity dispersion $\sigma(m)$ can be described by an exponential function $\sigma^2\propto \exp(-m/m_\mathrm{eq})$, with the parameter $m_\mathrm{eq}$ quantifying the degree of partial energy equipartition of the systems. This simple parametrization successfully captures the behaviour of the velocity dispersion at lower as well as higher stellar masses, that is, the regime where the system is expected to approach full equipartition. We find a tight correlation between the degree of equipartition reached by a GC and its dynamical state, indicating that clusters that are more than about 20 core relaxation times old, have reached a maximum degree of equipartition. This equipartition$-$dynamical state relation can be used as a tool to characterize the relaxation condition of a cluster with a kinematic measure of the $m_\mathrm{eq}$ parameter. Vice versa, the mass-dependence of the kinematics can be predicted knowing the relaxation time solely on the basis of photometric measurements. Moreover, any deviations from this tight relation could be used as a probe of a peculiar dynamical history of a cluster. Finally, our novel approach is important for the interpretation of state-of-the-art Hubble Space Telescope proper motion data, for which the mass dependence of kinematics can now be measured, and for the application of modeling techniques which take into consideration multi-mass components and mass segregation.",1

13192,0,"Photo-z Estimation: An Example of Nonparametric Conditional Density Estimation under Selection Bias Redshift is a key quantity for inferring cosmological model parameters. In photometric redshift estimation, cosmologists use the coarse data collected from the vast majority of galaxies to predict the redshift of individual galaxies. To properly quantify the uncertainty in the predictions, however, one needs to go beyond standard regression and instead estimate the full conditional density f(z|x) of a galaxy's redshift z given its photometric covariates x. The problem is further complicated by selection bias: usually only the rarest and brightest galaxies have known redshifts, and these galaxies have characteristics and measured covariates that do not necessarily match those of more numerous and dimmer galaxies of unknown redshift. Unfortunately, there is not much research on how to best estimate complex multivariate densities in such settings. Here we describe a general framework for properly constructing and assessing nonparametric conditional density estimators under selection bias, and for combining two or more estimators for optimal performance. We propose new improved photo-z estimators and illus- trate our methods on data from the Sloan Data Sky Survey and an application to galaxy-galaxy lensing. Although our main application is photo-z estimation, our methods are relevant to any high-dimensional regression setting with complicated asymmetric and multimodal distributions in the response variable.",1

We demonstrate that topological quantum order requires a particular type of `symmetry breaking' for the fixed point subspace of the transfer matrix, and relate physical anyon excitations to domain wall excitations at the level of the transfer matrix. A topological phase transition to a trivial phase triggers a change in the fixed point subspace to either a larger or smaller symmetry and we explain how this relates to a condensation or confinement of the corresponding anyon sectors. The tensor network formalism enables us to determine the structure of the topological sectors in two-dimensional gapped phases very efficiently, therefore opening novel avenues for studying fundamental open questions related to anyon condensation.",1

13761,0,"Deep spectroscopy of nearby galaxy clusters: I. Spectroscopic luminosity function of Abell 85 We present a new deep spectroscopic catalogue for Abell 85, within 3.0 $\times$ 2.6 Mpc$^2$ and down to $M_{r} \sim M_{r}^* +6$. Using the Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VIMOS@VLT) and the AutoFiber 2 at the William Herschel Telescope (AF2@WHT), we obtained almost 1,430 new redshifts for galaxies with $m_r \leq 21$ mag and $\langle \mu_{e,r} \rangle \leq 24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. These redshifts, together with SDSS-DR6 and NED spectroscopic information, result in 460 confirmed cluster members. This dataset allows the study of the luminosity function (LF) of the cluster galaxies covering three orders of magnitudes in luminosities. The total and radial LFs are best modelled by a double Schechter function. The normalized LFs show that their bright ($M_{r} \leq -21.5$) and faint ($M_{r}\geq -18.0$) ends are independent of clustercentric distance and similar to the field LFs unlike the intermediate luminosity range ($-21.5 \leq M_{r} \leq -18.0$). Similar results are found for the LFs of the dominant types of galaxies: red, passive, virialized and early-infall members. On the contrary, the LFs of blue, star forming, non-virialized and recent-infall galaxies are well described by a single Schechter function. These populations contribute to a small fraction of the galaxy density in the innermost cluster region. However, in the outskirts of the cluster, they have similar densities to red, passive, virialized and early-infall members at the LF faint end. These results confirm a clear dependence of the colour and star formation of Abell 85 members in the cluster centric distance.",1
14044,0,"Quantum criticality and global phase diagram of an Ising-anisotropic Kondo lattice Recent studies of heavy-fermion systems with tunable quantum fluctuations have focused on a variety of zero-temperature phase transitions that involve not only the onset of magnetic order but also the destruction of Kondo entanglement. Motivated by these developments, we investigate the effect of enhanced quantum fluctuations induced by a transverse magnetic field in an Ising-anisotropic Kondo lattice model, solved within an extended dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group. A line of locally critical points describes a direct transition from a Kondo-screened paramagnetic heavy-fermion state to a Kondo-destroyed antiferromagnetic phase. Along the line, the extracted critical exponents remain unchanged. By probing the the interplay between quantum fluctuations of the local moments, the Kondo effect, and magnetic order, this study provides significant new insight into the global phase diagram of heavy-fermion systems.",1
14070,0,"Random sub-Nyquist polarimetric modulator We show that it is possible to measure polarization with a polarimeter that gets rid of the seeing while still measuring at a frequency well below that of the seeing. We study a standard polarimeter made of two retarders and a beamsplitter. The retarders are modulated at $\sim 500$ Hz, a frequency comparable to that of the variations of the refraction index in the Earth atmosphere, what is usually termed as seeing in astronomical observations. However, we assume that the camera is slow, so that our measurements are time integrations of these modulated signals. In order to recover the time variation of the seeing and obtain the Stokes parameters, we use the theory of compressed sensing to solve the demodulation by impose a sparsity constraint on the Fourier coefficients of the seeing. We demonstrate the feasibility of this sub-Nyquist polarimeter using numerical simulations, both in the case without noise and with noise. We show that a sensible modulation scheme is obtained by randomly changing the fast axis of the modulators or their retardances in specific ways. We finally demonstrate that the value of the Stokes parameters can be recovered with great precision at almost maximum efficiency, although it slightly degrades when the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations increase, a consequence of the multiplexing under the presence of photon noise.",1
14207,0,"The radiation environment in a Low Earth Orbit: the case of BeppoSAX Low-inclination, low altitude Earth orbits (LEO) are of increasing importance for astrophysical satellites, due to their low background environment. Here, the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is the region with the highest amount of radiation. We study the radiation environment in a LEO (500-600 km altitude, 4 degrees inclination) through the particle background measured by the Particle Monitor (PM) experiment onboard the BeppoSAX satellite, between 1996 and 2002. Using time series of particle count rates measured by PM we construct intensity maps and derive SAA passage times and fluences. The low-latitude SAA regions are found to have an intensity strongly decreasing with altitude and dependent on the magnetic rigidity. The SAA extent, westward drift and strength vs altitude is shown.",1
14310,0,"Dynamical Topological Order Parameters far from Equilibrium We introduce a topological quantum number -- coined dynamical topological order parameter (DTOP) -- that is dynamically defined in the real-time evolution of a quantum many-body system and represented by a momentum space winding number of the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our construction goes conceptually beyond the standard notion of topological invariants characterizing the wave-function of a system, which are constants of motion under coherent time evolution. In particular, we show that the DTOP can change its integer value at discrete times where so called dynamical quantum phase transitions occur, thus serving as a dynamical analog of an order parameter. Interestingly, studying quantum quenches in one-dimensional two-banded Bogoliubov de Gennes models, we find that the DTOP is capable of resolving if the topology of the system Hamiltonian has changed over the quench. Furthermore, we investigate the relation of the DTOP to the dynamics of the string order parameter that characterizes the topology of such systems in thermal equilibrium.",1

We reveal that the Klein-Gordon equation has a hidden non-Hermitian kinetic energy operator. The probability continuity equation with sources indicates that there exists a different way of probability transportation, which is probability teleportation. An average formula is deducted from the relativistic Schrodinger equation, the Dirac equation, and the K-G equation.",1

14557,0,"A Novel Visualization of the Geometry of Special Relativity The mathematical treatment and graphical representation of Special Relativity (SR) are well established, yet carry deep implications that remain hard to visualize. This paper presents a new graphical interpretation of the geometry of SR that may, by complementing the standard works, aid the understanding of SR and its fundamental principles in a more intuitive way. From the axiom that the velocity of light remains constant to any inertial observer, the geodesic is presented as a line of constant angle on the complex plane across a set of diverging reference frames. The resultant curve is a logarithmic spiral, and this view of the geodesic is extended to illustrate the relativistic Doppler effect, time dilation, length contraction, the twin paradox, and relativistic radar distance in an original way, whilst retaining the essential mathematical relationships of SR. Using a computer-generated graphical representation of photon trajectories allows a visual comparison between the relativistic relationships and their classical counterparts, to visualize the consequences of SR as velocities become relativistic. The model may readily be extended to other situations, and may be found useful in presenting a fresh understanding of SR through geometric visualization.",1
14609,0,"A (2+1)-dimensional Gaussian field as fluctuations of quantum random walks on quantum groups This paper introduces a (2+1)-dimensional Gaussian field which has the Gaussian free field on the upper half-plane with zero boundary conditions as certain two-dimensional sections. Along these sections, called space-like paths, it matches the Gaussian field from eigenvalues of random matrices and from a growing random surface. However, along time-like paths the behavior is different. The Gaussian field arises as the asymptotic fluctuations in quantum random walks on quantum groups U_q(gl_n). This quantum random walk is a q-deformation of previously considered quantum random walks. The construction is accomplished utilizing Etingof-Kirillov difference operators in place of differential operators on GL(n). When restricted to the space-like paths, the moments of the quantum random walk match the moments of the growing random surface.",1
14768,0,"Ground-state properties of anyons in a one-dimensional lattice Using the Anyon-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we analyze the ground-state properties of anyons in a one-dimensional lattice. To this end we map the hopping dynamics of correlated anyons to an occupation-dependent hopping Bose-Hubbard model using the fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation. In particular, we calculate the quasi-momentum distribution of anyons, which interpolates between Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Analytically, we apply a modified Gutzwiller mean-field approach, which goes beyond a classical one by including the influence of the fractional phase of anyons within the many-body wavefunction. Numerically, we use the density-matrix renormalization group by relying on the ansatz of matrix product states. As a result it turns out that the anyonic quasi-momentum distribution reveals both a peak-shift and an asymmetry which mainly originates from the nonlocal string property. In addition, we determine the corresponding quasi-momentum distribution of the Jordan-Wigner transformed bosons, where, in contrast to the hard-core case, we also observe an asymmetry for the soft-core case, which strongly depends on the particle number density.",1
15011,0,"What a Tangled Web We Weave: Hermus as the Northern Extension of the Phoenix Stream We investigate whether the recently discovered Phoenix stream may be part of a much longer structure that includes the previously discovered Hermus stream. Using a simple model of the Galaxy with a disk, bulge, and a spherical dark matter halo, we show that a nearly circular orbit, highly inclined with respect to the disk, can be found that fits the positions, orientations, and distances of both streams. While the two streams are somewhat misaligned in the sense that they do not occupy the same plane, nodal precession due to the Milky Way disk potential naturally brings the orbit into line with each stream in the course of half an orbit. We consequently consider a common origin for the two streams as plausible. Based on our best fitting orbit, we make predictions for the positions, distances, radial velocities, and proper motions along each stream. If our hypothesis is borne out by measurements, then at ~183 degrees (~235 degrees with respect to the Galactic center) and ~76 kpc in length, Phoenix-Hermus would become the longest cold stream yet found. This would make it a particularly valuable new probe of the shape and mass of the Galactic halo out to ~20 kpc.",1
15050,0,"Floquet topological system based on frequency-modulated classical coupled harmonic oscillators We theoretically propose how to observe topological effects in a generic classical system of coupled harmonic oscillators, such as classical pendula or lumped-element electric circuits, whose oscillation frequency is modulated fast in time. Making use of Floquet theory in the high frequency limit, we identify a regime in which the system is accurately described by a Harper-Hofstadter model where the synthetic magnetic field can be externally tuned via the phase of the frequency-modulation of the different oscillators. We illustrate how the topologically-protected chiral edge states, as well as the Hofstadter butterfly of bulk bands, can be observed in the driven-dissipative steady state under a monochromatic drive. In analogy with the integer quantum Hall effect, we show how the topological Chern numbers of the bands can be extracted from the mean transverse shift of the steady-state oscillation amplitude distribution. Finally we discuss the regime where the analogy with the Harper-Hofstadter model breaks down.",1
15074,0,"Influence of ionisation zone motion in high power impulse magnetron sputtering on angular ion flux and NbO$_x$ film growth The ion energies and fluxes in the high power impulse magnetron sputtering plasma from a Nb target were analysed angularly resolved along the tangential direction of the racetrack. A reactive oxygen-containing atmosphere was used as such discharge conditions are typically employed for the synthesis of thin films. Asymmetries in the flux distribution of the recorded ions as well as their energies and charge states were noticed when varying the angle between mass-energy analyser and target surface. More positively charged ions with higher count rates in the medium energy range of their distributions were detected in $+\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ than in $-\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ direction, thus confirming the notion that ionisation zones (also known as spokes or plasma bunches) are associated with moving potential humps. The motion of the recorded negatively charged high-energy oxygen ions was unaffected. NbO$_x$ thin films at different angles and positions were synthesised and analysed as to their structure and properties in order to correlate the observed plasma properties to the film growth conditions. The chemical composition and the film thickness varied with changing deposition angle, where the latter, similar to the ion fluxes, was higher in $+\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ than in $-\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ direction.",1

15299,0,"Classical foundations of many-particle quantum chaos In the framework of semiclassical theory the universal properties of quantum systems with classically chaotic dynamics can be accounted for through correlations between partner periodic orbits with small action differences. So far, however, the scope of this approach has been mainly limited to systems of a few particles with low-dimensional phase spaces. In the present work we consider N-particle chaotic systems with local homogeneous interactions, where N is not necessarily small. Based on a model of coupled cat maps we demonstrate emergence of a new mechanism for correlation between periodic orbit actions. In particular, we show the existence of partner orbits which are specific to many-particle systems. For a sufficiently large N these new partners dominate the spectrum of correlating periodic orbits and seem to be necessary for construction of a consistent many-particle semiclassical theory.",1
15374,0,"Sensitivity Enhancement of Pd/Co Bi-layer Film for Hydrogen Gas Sensing using Perpendicular-to-Plane Ferromagnetic Resonance Configuration Previously, it has been shown that the strength of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of thin Palladium-Cobalt bi-layer films can be modified when hydrogen gas is absorbed by the Palladium (Pd) layer. In our recent work we showed that the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) response of this material is sensitive to changes in PMA upon exposure of Pd to hydrogen gas. As such, a simple, compact and contactless hydrogen gas sensor could exploit FMR-based detection, of the reversible hydrogen-gas-induced changes in PMA. The magnitude of the FMR peak shift is critical in determining the sensor's sensitivity: the higher the FMR peak shift at a given hydrogen gas concentration, the higher the sensitivity. In the present work we demonstrate that the detection sensitivity is enhanced when the static magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the film plane. A factor of eight times improvement is observed with respect to the in-plane FMR configuration studied previously. An analysis based on the Kittel equation for FMR frequencies of a ferromagnetic film is carried out in order to understand the mechanism of sensitivity enhancement. The result is important for optimizing Pd/Co bi-layered thin films for use in novel platforms for hydrogen gas sensing.",1
15385,0,"Integral formulae for codimension-one foliated Finsler manifolds We study extrinsic geometry of a codimension-one foliation ${\cal F}$ of a closed Finsler space $(M,F)$, in particular, of a Randers space $(M,\alpha+\beta)$. Using a unit vector field $\nu$ orthogonal (in the Finsler sense) to the leaves of ${\cal F}$ we define a new Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$, which for Randers case depends nicely on $(\alpha,\beta)$. For that $g$ we derive several geometric invariants of ${\cal F}$ (e.g. the Riemann curvature and the shape operator) in terms of $F$, then under natural assumptions on $\beta$ which simplify derivations, we express them in terms of corresponding invariants arising from $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Using our approach (2012), we produce the integral formulae for ${\cal F}$ on $(M, F)$ and $(M, \alpha+\beta)$, which relate integrals of mean curvatures with those involving algebraic invariants obtained from the shape operator of a foliation, and the Riemann curvature in the direction $\nu$. They generalize the formulae by Brito, Langevin and Rosenberg, which show that total mean curvatures (of arbitrary order $k$) for codimension-one foliations on a closed $(m+1)$-dimensional manifold of constant curvature $K$ don't depend on a choice of ${\cal F}$.",1
15397,0,"Supermassive black holes and their host spheroids I. Disassembling galaxies Several recent studies have performed galaxy decompositions to investigate correlations between the black hole mass and various properties of the host spheroid, but they have not converged on the same conclusions. This is because their models for the same galaxy were often significantly different and not consistent with each other in terms of fitted components. Using $3.6 \rm ~\mu m$ $Spitzer$ imagery, which is a superb tracer of the stellar mass (superior to the $K$-band), we have performed state-of-the-art multicomponent decompositions for 66 galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. Our sample is the largest to date and, unlike previous studies, contains a large number (17) of spiral galaxies with low black hole masses. We paid careful attention to the image mosaicking, sky subtraction and masking of contaminating sources. After a scrupulous inspection of the galaxy photometry (through isophotal analysis and unsharp masking) and - for the first time - 2D kinematics, we were able to account for spheroids, large-scale, intermediate-scale and nuclear disks, bars, rings, spiral arms, halos, extended or unresolved nuclear sources and partially depleted cores. For each individual galaxy, we compared our best-fit model with previous studies, explained the discrepancies and identified the optimal decomposition. Moreover, we have independently performed 1D and 2D decompositions, and concluded that, at least when modelling large, nearby galaxies, 1D techniques have more advantages than 2D techniques. Finally, we developed a prescription to estimate the uncertainties on the 1D best-fit parameters for the 66 spheroids that takes into account systematic errors, unlike popular 2D codes that only consider statistical errors.",1
15458,0,"Calibration scheme for large Kinetic Inductance Detector Arrays based on Readout Frequency Response Microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) provides a way to build large ground based sub-mm instruments such as NIKA and A-MKID. For such instruments, therefore, it is important to understand and characterize the response to ensure good linearity and calibration over wide dynamic range. We propose to use the MKID readout frequency response to determine the MKID responsivity to an input optical source power. A signal can be measured in a KID as a change in the phase of the readout signal with respect to the KID resonant circle. Fundamentally, this phase change is due to a shift in the KID resonance frequency, in turn due to a radiation induced change in the quasiparticle number in the superconducting resonator. We show that shift in resonant frequency can be determined from the phase shift by using KID phase versus frequency dependence using a previously measured resonant frequency. Working in this calculated resonant frequency, we gain near linearity and constant calibration to a constant optical signal applied in a wide range of operating points on the resonance and readout powers. This calibration method has three particular advantages: first, it is fast enough to be used to calibrate large arrays, with pixel counts in the thousand of pixels; second, it is based on data that are already necessary to determine KID positions; third, it can be done without applying any optical source in front of the array.",1
15478,0,"Measure fiber position errors from spectra data Precise fiber positioning is crucial to a wide field, multi-fiber spectroscopic survey like LAMOST. Nowadays, most position error measurements are based on CCD photographic and imaging processing techniques. Those methods only work for measuring errors orthogonal to the telescope optical axis, while there also lies errors parallel to the telescope optical axis, like defocusing, and error caused by the existing deviation angle between optical axes of a fiber and the telescope. Directly measuring two latter types of position errors is difficult for individual fiber, especially during observation. Possible sources of fiber position errors are discussed in brief for LAMOST. By constructing a model of magnitude loss due to the fiber position error for a point source, we propose an indirect method to calculate the total and systematic position errors for each individual fiber from spectra data. Restrictions and applications of this method are also discussed.",1
15481,0,"The magnetized galactic wind and synchrotron halo of the starburst dwarf galaxy IC10 We aim to explore whether strong magnetic fields can be effectively generated in low-mass dwarf galaxies and, if so, whether such fields can be affected by galactic outflows and spread out into the intergalactic medium (IGM). We performed a radio continuum polarimetry study of IC10, the nearest starbursting dwarf galaxy, using a combination of multifrequency interferometric (VLA) and single-dish (Effelsberg) observations. VLA observations at 1.43 GHz reveal an extensive and almost spherical radio halo of IC10 in total intensity, extending twice more than the infrared-emitting galactic disk. The halo is magnetized with a magnetic field strength of 7 microG in the outermost parts. Locally, the magnetic field reaches about 29 microG in HII complexes, becomes more ordered, and weakens to 22 microG in the synchrotron superbubble and to 7-10 microG within HI holes. At the higher frequency of 4.86 GHz, we found a large-scale magnetic field structure of X-shaped morphology, similar to that observed in several edge-on spiral galaxies. The X-shaped magnetic structure can be caused by the galactic wind, advecting magnetic fields injected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds and supernova explosions. The radio continuum scale heights at 1.43 GHz indicate the bulk speed of cosmic-ray electrons outflowing from HII complexes of about 60 km/s, exceeding the escape velocity of 40 km/s. Hence, the magnetized galactic wind in IC10 inflates the extensive radio halo visible at 1.43 GHz and can seed the IGM with both random and ordered magnetic fields. These are signatures of intense material feedback onto the IGM, expected to be prevalent in the protogalaxies of the early Universe.",1
15507,0,"The dominance of quenching through cosmic times The evolution with cosmic time of the star formation rate density (SFRD) and of the ""Main Sequence"" star formation rate-stellar mass relations are two well established observational facts. In this paper the implications of these two relations combined are analytically explored, showing that quenching of star formation must start already at very early cosmic times and the quenched fraction then dominates ever since over the star forming one. Thus, a simple picture of the cosmic evolution of the global SFRD is derived, in terms of the interplay between star formation and its quenching.",1
15543,0,"The evolution of dwarf galaxy satellites with different dark matter density profiles in the ErisMod simulations. I. The early infalls We present the first simulations of tidal stirring of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group carried out in a cosmological context. We use the ErisDARK simulation of a MW-sized galaxy to identify some of the most massive subhalos ($M_{vir} &gt; 10^8 M_{\odot}$) that fall into the main host before $z=2$. Subhalos are replaced before infall with high-resolution models of dwarf galaxies comprising a faint stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo. The set of models contains cuspy halos as well as halos with ""cored"" profiles (with asymptotic inner slope $\gamma = 0.6$). The simulations are then run to $z=0$ with as many as 54 million particles and resolution as small as $\sim 4$ pc using the N-Body code ChaNGa. The stellar components of all satellites are significantly affected by tidal stirring, losing stellar mass and undergoing a morphological transformation towards a pressure supported spheroidal system. However, while some remnants with cuspy halos maintain significant rotational flattening and disk-like features, all the shallow halo models achieve $v/\sigma &lt; 0.5$ and round shapes typical of dSph satellites of the MW and M31. Mass loss is also enhanced in the latter, and remnants can reach luminosities and velocity dispersions as low as those of Ultra Faint Dwarfs (UFDs). We argue that cuspy progenitors must be the exception rather than the rule among satellites of the MW since all the MW and M31 satellites in the luminosity range of our remnants are dSphs, a result matched only in the simulation with ""cored"" models.",1
15554,0,"Approximating W projection as a separable kernel W projection is a commonly-used approach to allow interferometric imaging to be accelerated by Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), but it can require a huge amount of storage for convolution kernels. The kernels are not separable, but we show that they can be closely approximated by separable kernels. The error scales with the fourth power of the field of view, and so is small enough to be ignored at mid to high frequencies. We also show that hybrid imaging algorithms combining W projection with either faceting, snapshotting, or W stacking allow the error to be made arbitrarily small, making the approximation suitable even for high-resolution wide-field instruments.",1
15609,0,"Stellar Velocity Dispersion for a Strongly-Lensed, Intermediate-Mass Quiescent Galaxy at z=2.8 Measuring stellar velocity dispersions of quiescent galaxies beyond $z\sim2$ is observationally challenging. Such measurements require near-infrared spectra with a continuum detection of at least moderate signal-to-noise, often necessitating long integrations. In this paper, we present deep X-Shooter spectroscopy of one of only two known gravitationally-lensed massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;2$. This galaxy is quadruply imaged, with the brightest images magnified by a factor of $\sim5$. The total exposure time of our data is 9.8 hours on-source; however the magnification, and the slit placement encompassing 2 images, provides a total equivalent exposure time of 215 hours. From this deep spectrum we measure a redshift ($z_{\mathrm{spec}}=2.756\pm0.001$), making this one of the highest redshift quiescent galaxies that is spectroscopically confirmed. We simultaneously fit both the spectroscopic and photometric data to determine stellar population parameters and conclude this galaxy is relatively young, intermediate-mass, consistent with low dust content, and has quenched only relatively recently. This recent quenching is confirmed by strong Balmer absorption, particularly $H\delta$. Remarkably, this proves that at least some intermediate-mass galaxies have already quenched as early as $z\sim2.8$. Additionally, we have measured a velocity dispersion ($\sigma=187\pm43~\mathrm{km/s}$), making this the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy with a dispersion measurement. We confirm that this galaxy falls on the same mass fundamental plane (MFP) as galaxies at z=2.2, consistent with little to no evolution in the MFP up to z=2.8. Overall this galaxy is proof of existence of intermediate-mass quenched galaxies in the distant universe, and that lensing is a powerful tool for determining their properties with improved accuracy.",1

15686,0,"Precise Calculation of Single and Double Ionization of Hydrogen Molecule in Intense Laser Pulses A new simulation box setup is introduced for the precise description of the wavepacket evolution of two electronic systems in intense laser pulses. In this box, the regions of the hydrogen molecule H$_{2} $, and singly and doubly ionized species, H$_{2}^+ $ and H$_{2}^{+2} $, are well recognized and their time-dependent populations are calculated at different laser field intensities. In addition, some new regions are introduced and characterized as quasi-double ionization and their time-dependencies on the laser field intensity are calculated and analyzed. The adopted simulation box setup is special in that it assures proper evaluation of the second ionization. In this study, the dynamics of the electrons and nuclei of the hydrogen molecule are separated based on the adiabatic approximation. The time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger and Newton equations are solved simultaneously for the electrons and the nuclei, respectively. Laser pulses of 390 nm wavelength at four different intensities (i.e. $ 1\times10^{14} $, $ 5\times10^{14} $, $ 1\times10^{15} $, and $ 5\times10^{15} $ W cm$^{-2}$) are used in these simulations. Details of the central H$_{2} $ region is also presented and discussed. This region is divided into four sub-regions related to the ionic state H$^+$H$^-$ and covalent (natural) state HH.

15877,0,"Challenging Fuel Cycle Modeling Assumptions: Facility and Time Step Discretization Effects Due to the diversity of fuel cycle simulator modeling assumptions, direct comparison and benchmarking can be difficult. In 2012 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development completed a benchmark study that is perhaps the most complete published comparison performed. Despite this, various results from the simulators were often significantly different because of inconsistencies in modeling decisions involving reprocessing strategies, refueling behavior, reactor end-of-life handling, etc. This work identifies and quantifies the effects of selected modeling choices that may sometimes be taken for granted in the fuel cycle simulation domain. Four scenarios are compared using combinations of fleet-based or individually modeled reactors with monthly or quarterly (3-month) time steps. The scenarios approximate a transition from the current U.S. once-through light water reactor fleet to a full sodium fast reactor fuel cycle. The Cyclus fuel cycle simulator's plug-in capability along with its market-like dynamic material routing allow it to be used as a level playing field for comparing the scenarios. When under supply-constraint pressure, the four cases exhibit noticeably different behavior. Fleet-based modeling is more efficient in supply-constrained environments at the expense of losing insight on issues such as realistically suboptimal fuel distribution and challenges in reactor refueling cycle staggering. Finer-grained time steps enable more efficient material use in supply-constrained environments resulting in lower standing inventories of separated Pu. Large simulations with fleet-based reactors run much more quickly than their individual reactor counterparts. Gaining a better understanding of how these and other modeling choices affect fuel cycle dynamics will enable making more deliberate decisions with respect to trade-offs such as computational investment vs. realism.",1

We directly measured the Franck-Condon factor of the $\mathrm{B}^2\Sigma^+(v'=0)\leftarrow\mathrm{X}^2\Sigma^+(v""=1)$ transition. Prospects for production of a high luminosity cryogenic BaH beam are outlined. This molecule is a promising candidate for laser cooling and ultracold fragmentation, both of which are precursors to novel experiments in many-body physics and precision measurement.",1
15983,0,"A simple way to improve AGN feedback prescription in SPH simulations AGN feedback is an important ingredient in galaxy evolution, however its treatment in numerical simulations is necessarily approximate, requiring subgrid prescriptions due to the dynamical range involved in the calculations. We present a suite of SPH simulations designed to showcase the importance of the choice of a particular subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. We concentrate on two approaches to treating wide-angle AGN outflows: thermal feedback, where thermal and kinetic energy is injected into the gas surrounding the SMBH particle, and virtual particle feedback, where energy is carried by tracer particles radially away from the AGN. We show that the latter model produces a far more complex structure around the SMBH, which we argue is a more physically correct outcome. We suggest a simple improvement to the thermal feedback model - injecting the energy into a cone, rather than spherically symmetrically - and show that this markedly improves the agreement between the two prescriptions, without requiring any noticeable increase in the computational cost of the simulation.",1

With the images he could get, he showed that novae do indeed explode in an aspherical way, leading to a change of paradigm for the physics of these yet-poorly understood catastrophic systems. He also set the stage for a new way of estimating novae distances, by directly measuring the sky-size of the fireball and comparing it with spectroscopic scales, taking into account the tremendous effects of the fireball geometry.",1
16023,0,"Nonequilibrium dynamics of the Ising chain in a fluctuating transverse field We study nonequilibrium dynamics of the quantum Ising chain at zero temperature when the transverse field is varied stochastically. In the equivalent fermion representation, the equation of motion of Majorana operators is derived in the form of a one-dimensional, continuous-time quantum random walk with stochastic, time-dependent transition amplitudes. This type of external noise gives rise to decoherence in the associated quantum walk and the semiclassical wave-packet generally has a diffusive behavior. As a consequence, in the quantum Ising chain, the average entanglement entropy grows in time as $t^{1/2}$ and the logarithmic average magnetization decays in the same form. In the case of a dichotomous noise, when the transverse-field is changed in discrete time-steps, $\tau$, there can be excitation modes, for which coherence is maintained, provided their energy satisfies $\epsilon_k \tau\approx n\pi$ with a positive integer $n$. If the dispersion of $\epsilon_k$ is quadratic, the long-time behavior of the entanglement entropy and the logarithmic magnetization is dominated by these ballistically traveling coherent modes and both will have a $t^{3/4}$ time-dependence.",1
16072,0,"Microfabrication technology for large LEKID arrays : from NIKA2 to future applications The Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKID)demonstrated full maturity in the NIKA (New IRAM KID Arrays)instrument. These results allow directly comparing LEKID performance with other competing technologies (TES, doped silicon) in the mm and sub-mm range. A continuing effort is ongoing to improve the microfabrication technologies and concepts in order to satisfy the requirements of new instruments. More precisely, future satellites dedicated to CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) studies will require the same focal plane technology to cover, at least, the frequency range of 60 to 600 GHz. Aluminium LEKID developed for NIKA have so far demonstrated, under real telescope conditions, performance approaching photon-noise limitation in the band 120-300 GHz. By implementing superconducting bi-layers we recently demonstrated LEKID arrays working in the range 80-120 GHz and with sensitivities approaching the goals for CMB missions. NIKA itself (350 pixels) is followed by a more ambitious project requiring several thousands (3000-5000) pixels. NIKA2 has been installed in October 2015 at the IRAM 30-m telescope.

Remarkably, the dispersion relation in one-dimensional Kitaev systems allows for wavepackets of arbitrary size undergoing non-decaying ZB without any distortion, with the typical ZB amplitude being one lattice site. To motivate possible experimental interest in this dynamical aspect of superconducting systems, we further show that certain on-resonance modulation of the Hamiltonian parameter can be exploited to convert ZB oscillations to net drifting of particle's wavepacket and hole's wavepacket along opposite directions, leading to long-distance particle-hole separation.",1

To release the cantilever, wet anisotropic etching of Silicon (Si) was performed by tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The transverse piezoelectric coefficient d31 of the ZnO film, obtained from the deflection of the cantilever with influence of applied voltage, was calculated as 3.32 pC/N. The observed dynamic characterization of the novel piezoelectric microcantilever had linear response with the applied driving voltage. The obtained values of Young Modulus and Hardness were 208 +4 GPa and 4.84+ 0.1 GPa respectively. This inexpensive novel method provides additional design flexibility to fabricate vibrational energy harvesters. The easy steps of fabrication and cost effectiveness of this method may be preferred it over DRIE. The voltage induced due to deformation of ZnO cantilever were measured ~230mV.

16292,0,"Origin and properties of dual and offset active galactic nuclei in a cosmological simulation at z=2 In the last few years, it became possible to observationally resolve galaxies with two distinct nuclei in their centre. For separations smaller than 10kpc, dual and offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) are distinguished: in dual AGN, both nuclei are active, whereas in offset AGN only one nucleus is active. To study the origin of such AGN pairs, we employ a cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation with a large volume of (182Mpc)^3 from the set of Magneticum Pathfinder Simulations. The simulation self-consistently produces 35 resolved black hole (BH) pairs at redshift z=2, with a comoving distance smaller than 10kpc. 14 of them are offset AGN and nine are dual AGN, resulting in a fraction of (1.2 \pm 0.3)% AGN pairs with respect to the total number of AGN. In this paper, we discuss fundamental differences between the BH and galaxy properties of dual AGN, offset AGN and inactive BH pairs and investigate their different triggering mechanisms. We find that in dual AGN the BHs have similar masses and the corresponding BH from the less massive progenitor galaxy always accretes with a higher Eddington ratio. In contrast, in offset AGN the active BH is typically more massive than its non-active counterpart. Furthermore, dual AGN in general accrete more gas from the intergalactic medium than offset AGN and non-active BH pairs. This highlights that merger events, particularly minor mergers, do not necessarily lead to strong gas inflows and thus, do not always drive strong nuclear activity.",1

16565,0,"The Realization and Dectection of Weyl Semimetals and Chiral Anomaly in Cold Atomic Systems In this work, we describe a method to realize 3D Weyl semimetal by coupling multilayers of honeycomb optical lattice in the presence of a pair of Raman lasers. The Raman lasers render each isolated honeycomb layer a Chern insulator. With finite interlayer coupling, the bulk gap of the system closes at certain out-of-plane momenta due to Raman assisted tunnelling and result in the Weyl semimetal phase. Using experimentally relevant parameters, we show that both one and two pairs of Weyl points can be realized by tuning the interlayer coupling strength. We suggest that Landau-Zener tunnelling can be used to detect Weyl points and show that the transition probability increases dramatically when Weyl point emerges. The realization of chiral anomaly by using a magnetic field gradient is also discussed.",1
16667,0,"Supernovae and their host galaxies - IV. The distribution of supernovae relative to spiral arms Using a sample of 215 supernovae (SNe), we analyze their positions relative to the spiral arms of their host galaxies, distinguishing grand-design (GD) spirals from non-GD (NGD) galaxies. We find that: (1) in GD galaxies, an offset exists between the positions of Ia and core-collapse (CC) SNe relative to the peaks of arms, while in NGD galaxies the positions show no such shifts; (2) in GD galaxies, the positions of CC SNe relative to the peaks of arms are correlated with the radial distance from the galaxy nucleus. Inside (outside) the corotation radius, CC SNe are found closer to the inner (outer) edge. No such correlation is observed for SNe in NGD galaxies nor for SNe Ia in either galaxy class; (3) in GD galaxies, SNe Ibc occur closer to the leading edges of the arms than do SNe II, while in NGD galaxies they are more concentrated towards the peaks of arms. In both samples of hosts, the distributions of SNe Ia relative to the arms have broader wings. These observations suggest that shocks in spiral arms of GD galaxies trigger star formation in the leading edges of arms affecting the distributions of CC SNe (known to have short-lived progenitors). The closer locations of SNe Ibc vs. SNe II relative to the leading edges of the arms supports the belief that SNe Ibc have more massive progenitors. SNe Ia having less massive and older progenitors, have more time to drift away from the leading edge of the spiral arms.",1

Rev. A {\bf 57}, 4204 (1998)], which were earlier evinced to be disagreeing with an earlier rigorous theoretical study [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 69}, 040501(R) (2004)] and with another precise measurement [Opt. Lett. {\bf 21}, 74 (1996)]. In this work, we have carried out calculations of the radiative transition matrix elements using many variants of relativistic many-body methods, mainly in the coupled-cluster theory framework, and analyze propagation of the electron correlation effects to elucidate their roles for accurate evaluations of the matrix elements. We also demonstrate contributions explicitly from the Dirac-Coulomb interactions, frequency independent Breit interaction and lower order quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects. Uncertainties to these matrix elements due to different possible sources of errors are estimated. By combining our calculated radiative matrix elements with the experimental values of the transition wavelengths, we obtain the transition probabilities due to both the allowed and lower order forbidden channels. Adding these quantities together, the lifetimes of the above two states are determined precisely and plausible reasons for the reported inconsistencies between the earlier theoretical calculations and the experimental results have been pointed out.",1
16979,0,"Simulating topological phases and topological phase transitions with classical strings The discovery of the topological insulators has fueled a surge of interests in the topological phases in periodic systems. Topological insulators have bulk energy gap and topologically protected gapless edge states. The edge states in electronic systems have been detected by observing the transport properties the Hgte quantum wells. The electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge states have been predicted and observed in photonic crystals, coupled resonators and linear circuits. However, the edge state spectrums of the two dimensional insulators and their electromagnetic analogues haven't been directly measured and thus the gaplessness of the edge states hasn't been experimentally confirmed. Here I show the classical strings are more convenient choice to study the topological phases than the electromagnetic waves. I found that classical strings with periodic densities can simulate a variety of topological phases in condensed matter physics including two dimensional topological insulators, three dimensional topological semimetals and weak topological insulators. Because the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the strings can be easily measured, not only the gapless edge state spectrum but also the bulk topological invariant can now be directly observed. Further more I show the topological phase transitions can be simulated by the strings. My results show the richness of topological phases of mechanical waves. I anticipate my work to be a starting point to study the topological properties of mechanical waves. Even richer topological phases other than those have been found in electronics systems can be explored when we use more general mechanical waves e.g. waves in membranes with periodic densities. These phases may provide guides to hunt novel topological properties in other branches of science.",1

Then $L$ is one of the explicit 'Lawlor neck' family of examples found by Lawlor (Invent. math. 95, 1989). (b) Suppose $L$ is a closed, embedded, exact Lagrangian mean curvature flow expander in ${\mathbb C}^m$ for $m\ge 3$ asymptotic at infinity to the union $\Pi_1\cup\Pi_2$ of two transverse Lagrangian planes $\Pi_1,\Pi_2$ in ${\mathbb C}^m$. Then $L$ is one of the explicit family of examples found by Joyce, Lee and Tsui, arXiv:0801.3721. If instead $L$ is immersed rather than embedded, the only extra possibility in (a),(b) is $L=\Pi_1\cup\Pi_2$.

17304,0,"Novel experimental design for high pressure - high temperature electrical resistance measurements in a 'Paris-Edinburgh' large volume press We present a novel experimental design for high sensitivity measurements of the electrical resistance of samples at high pressures (0-6GPa) and high temperatures (300-1000K) in a 'Paris-Edinburgh' type large volume press. Uniquely, the electrical measurements are carried out directly on a small sample, thus greatly increasing the sensitivity of the measurement. The sensitivity to even minor changes in electrical resistance can be used to clearly identify phase transitions in material samples. Electrical resistance measurements are relatively simple and rapid to execute and the efficacy of the present experimental design is demonstrated by measuring the electrical resistance of Pb, Sn and Bi across a wide domain of temperature-pressure phase space and employing it to identify the loci of phase transitions. Based on these results, the phase diagrams of these elements are reconstructed to high accuracy and found to be in excellent agreement with previous studies. In particular, by mapping the locations of several well-studied reference points in the phase diagram of Sn and Bi, it is demonstrated that a standard calibration exists for the temperature and pressure, thus eliminating the need for direct or indirect temperature and pressure measurements. The present technique will allow simple and accurate mapping of phase diagrams under extreme conditions and may be of particular importance in advancing studies of liquid state anomalies.",1

17414,0,"Relations between Microwave Bursts and near-Earth High-Energy Proton Enhancements and their Origin We further study the relations between parameters of bursts at 35 GHz recorded with the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters during 25 years, on the one hand, and solar proton events, on the other hand (Grechnev et al. in Publ. Astron. Soc. Japan 65, S4, 2013a). Here we address the relations between the microwave fluences at 35 GHz and near-Earth proton fluences above 100 MeV in order to find information on their sources and evaluate their diagnostic potential. A correlation was found to be pronouncedly higher between the microwave and proton fluences than between their peak fluxes. This fact probably reflects a dependence of the total number of protons on the duration of the acceleration process. In events with strong flares, the correlation coefficients of high-energy proton fluences with microwave and soft X-ray fluences are higher than those with the speeds of coronal mass ejections. The results indicate a statistically larger contribution of flare processes to high-energy proton fluxes. Acceleration by shock waves seems to be less important at high energies in events associated with strong flares, although its contribution is probable and possibly prevails in weaker events. The probability of a detectable proton enhancement was found to directly depend on the peak flux, duration, and fluence of the 35 GHz burst, while the role of the Big Flare Syndrome might be overestimated previously. Empirical diagnostic relations are proposed.",1

17904,0,"Hydrodynamic model for expansion and collisional relaxation of x-ray laser-excited multi-component nanoplasma The irradiation of an atomic cluster with a femtosecond x-ray free-electron laser pulse results in a nanoplasma formation. This typically occurs within a few hundreds femtoseconds. By this time the x-ray pulse is over, and the direct photoinduced processes no longer contributing. All created electrons within the nanoplasma are thermalized. The nanoplasma thus formed is a mixture of atoms, electrons and ions of various charges. While expanding, it is undergoing electron impact ionization and three-body recombination. Below we present a hydrodynamic model to describe the dynamics of such multi-component nanoplasma. The model equations are derived by taking the moments of the corresponding Boltzmann kinetic equations. We include the equations obtained, together with the source terms due to electron impact ionization and three-body recombination, in our hydrodynamic solver. Model predictions for a test case: expanding spherical Ar nanoplasma are obtained. With this model we complete the two-step approach to simulate x-ray created nanoplasmas, enabling computationally efficient simulations of their picosecond dynamics.

We show that there is a fermionic band insulator to bosonic insulator crossover in the insulating phase and a BCS-to-BEC crossover in the SC. The SIT is always found to be from a bosonic insulator to a BEC-like SC, with an energy gap for fermions that remains finite across the SIT. The energy scales that go critical at the SIT are the gap to pair excitations in the insulator and the superfluid stiffness in the SC.

18182,0,"A Wave Packet Approach to Interacting Fermions In this thesis, we study the breakdown of the Fermi liquid state in cuprate superconductors using the renormalization group (RG). We seek to extend earlier work on the crossover from the Fermi liquid state to the pseudo gap phase based on RG flows in the so-called saddle point regime. Progress in the derivation of effective models for the conjectured spin liquid state has been hindered, by the difficulties involved in solving the strong coupling low energy Hamiltonian. We tackle the problem by introducing an orthogonal wave packet basis, the so-called Wilson-Wannier (WW) basis, that can be used to interpolate between the momentum space and the real space descriptions. We show how to combine the WW basis with the RG, such that the RG is used to eliminate high-energy degrees of freedom, and the remaining strongly correlated system is solved approximately in the WW basis. We exemplify the approach for different one-dimensional model systems, and find good qualitative agreement with exact solutions even for very simple approximations. Finally, we reinvestigate the saddle point regime of the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We show that the anti-nodal states are driven to an insulating spin-liquid state with strong singlet pairing correlations, thus corroborating earlier conjectures.",1

These results suggest a more complex relationship between 30 THz emission and radiation produced at other wavelength ranges. The multiple frequency emissions in the impulsive phase are likely to be produced at a common flaring site lower in the chromosphere. The 30 THz burst emission may be either part of a nonthermal radiation mechanism or due to the rapid thermal response to a beam of high-energy particles bombarding the dense solar atmosphere.",1
18514,0,On the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff-de Sitter equation Spherically symmetric static solutions of the Einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant for the energy-momentum tensor of a barotropic perfect fluid are governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff-de Sitter equation.

The interior metric of the solution is connected with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric on the vacuum region.,1
18556,0,"Space-time Dynamics Estimation from Space Mission Tracking Data Many physical parameters that can be estimated from space mission tracking data influence both the translational dynamics and proper time rates of observers. These different proper time rates cause a variability of the time transfer observable beyond that caused by their translational (and rotational) dynamics. With the near-future implementation of (interplanetary) transponder laser ranging, these effects will become increasingly important, requiring a re-evaluation of the common data analysis practice of using a priori time ephemerides, which is the goal of this paper. We develop a framework for the simultaneous estimation of the initial translational state and the initial proper time of an observer, with the goal of facilitating robust tracking data analysis from next-generation space missions carrying highly accurate clocks and tracking equipment. Using our approach, the influence of physical parameters on both translational and time dynamics are considered at the same level in the analysis, and mutual correlations between the signatures of the two are automatically identified. We perform a covariance analysis using our proposed method with simulated laser data from Earth-based stations to both a Mars and Mercury lander. Using four years of tracking data for the Mars lander simulations, we find a difference between our results using the simultaneous space-time dynamics estimation and the classical analysis technique (with an ta priori time ephemeris) of around 0.1 % in formal errors and correlation coefficients. For a Mercury lander this rises to around 1% for a 1-month mission and 10 % for a 4-year mission. By means of Monte Carlo simulation, we find that using an a priori time ephemeris of representative accuracy will result in estimation errors that are orders of magnitude above the formal error when processing highly accurate laser time transfer data.",1

19044,0,"Improvement of Spectroscopic Performance using a Charge-sensitive Amplifier Circuit for an X-Ray Astronomical SOI Pixel Detector We have been developing monolithic active pixel sensors series, named ""XRPIX,"" based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel technology, for future X-ray astronomical satellites. The XRPIX series offers high coincidence time resolution ({\rm \sim}1 {\rm \mu}s), superior readout time ({\rm \sim}10 {\rm \mu}s), and a wide energy range (0.5--40 keV). In the previous study, we successfully demonstrated X-ray detection by event-driven readout of XRPIX2b. We here report recent improvements in spectroscopic performance. We successfully increased the gain and reduced the readout noise in XRPIX2b by decreasing the parasitic capacitance of the sense-node originated in the buried p-well (BPW). On the other hand, we found significant tail structures in the spectral response due to the loss of the charge collection efficiency when a small BPW is employed. Thus, we increased the gain in XRPIX3b by introducing in-pixel charge sensitive amplifiers instead of having even smaller BPW. We finally achieved the readout noise of 35 e{\rm ^{-}} (rms) and the energy resolution of 320 eV (FWHM) at 6 keV without significant loss of the charge collection efficiency.",1

19384,0,"Exploring the Overabundance of ULXs in Metal- and Dust-poor Local Lyman Break Analogs We have studied high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) populations within two low-metallicity, starburst galaxies, Haro 11 and VV 114. These galaxies serve as analogs to high-redshift (z&gt;2) Lyman break galaxies, and within the larger sample of Lyman break analogs (LBAs) are sufficiently nearby (&lt;87 Mpc) to be spatially-resolved by Chandra. Previous studies of the X-ray emission in LBAs have found that the 2-10 keV luminosity per star formation rate (SFR) in these galaxies is elevated, potentially because of their low metallicities (12+log[O/H]= 8.3-8.4). Theoretically, the progenitors of XRBs forming in lower metallicity environments lose less mass from stellar winds over their lifetimes, producing more massive compact objects (i.e., neutron stars and black holes), and thus resulting in more numerous and luminous HMXBs per SFR. We have performed an in-depth study of the only two LBAs that have spatially-resolved 2-10 keV emission with Chandra to present the bright end of the X-ray luminosity distribution of HMXBs (L$_X&gt;10^{39}$ erg/s; ultraluminous X-ray sources, ULXs) in these low-metallicity galaxies, based on 8 detected ULXs. Comparing with the star-forming galaxy X-ray luminosity function (XLF) presented by Mineo et al. (2012), Haro 11 and VV 114 host ~4 times more L$_X&gt;10^{40}$ erg/s sources than expected given their SFRs. We simulate the effects of source blending from crowded lower luminosity HMXBs using the star-forming galaxy XLF and then vary the XLF shapes until we reproduce the observed point source luminosity distributions. We find that these LBAs have a shallower bright end slope than the standard XLF. If we conservatively assume that the brightest X-ray source from each galaxy is powered by an AGN rather than a HMXB and eliminate these sources from consideration, the luminosity distribution becomes poorly constrained but does appear to be consistent with a standard XLF.

19395,0,"Dynamics of Coulombic and Gravitational Periodic Systems We study the dynamics and the phase-space structures of Coulombic and self-gravitating versions of the classical one-dimensional 3-body system with periodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate that such a 3-body system may be reduced isomorphically to a spatially periodic system of a single particle experiencing a two-dimensional potential on a rhombic plane. For the case of both Coulombic and gravitational versions, exact expressions of the Hamiltonian have been derived in rhombic coordinates. We simulate the phase-space evolution through an event-driven algorithm that utilizes analytic solutions to the equations of motion. The simulation results show that the motion exhibits chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic behaviors in segmented regions of the phase space. While there is no evidence of global chaos in either the Coulombic or the gravitational system, the former exhibits a transition from a completely non-chaotic phase space at low energies to a mixed behavior. Gradual yet striking transitions from mild to intense chaos are indicated with changing energy, a behavior that differentiates the spatially periodic systems studied in this paper from the well-understood free-boundary versions of the 3-body problem. Our treatment of the 3-body systems is the first one of its kind and opens avenues for analysis of the dynamical properties exhibited by spatially periodic versions of various classes of systems studied in plasma and gravitational physics as well as in cosmology.",1

The high-quality, echellette Magellan spectra reveal broad H$\alpha$ emission in all the sources, allowing us to estimate robust viral BH masses and Eddington ratios for this unique sample. We confirm that the sample contains low-mass BHs accreting at high rates: the median $M_{\rm BH} = 1.2\times 10^6M_\odot$ and median $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}=0.44$. The sample follows the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation, within the considerable scatter typical of pseudobulges, the probable hosts of these low-mass AGNs. Various lines of evidence suggest that ongoing star formation is prevalent in these systems. We propose a new strategy to estimate star formation rates in AGNs hosted by low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies, based on modification of an existing method using the strength of [O II] $\lambda 3727$, [O III] $\lambda 5007$, and X-rays.",1
19462,0,"Precise Pointing and Stabilization Performance for the Balloon-borne Imaging Testbed (BIT): 2015 Test Flight Balloon-borne astronomy offers an attractive option for experiments that require precise pointing and attitude stabilization, due to a large reduction in the atmospheric interference observed by ground-based systems as well as the low-cost and short development time-scale compared to space-borne systems. The Balloon-borne Imaging Testbed (BIT) is an instrument designed to meet the technological requirements of high precision astronomical missions and is a precursor to the development of a facility class instrument with capabilities similar to the Hubble Space Telescope. The attitude determination and control systems (ADCS) for BIT, the design, implementation, and analysis of which are the focus of this paper, compensate for compound pendulation effects and other sub-orbital disturbances in the stratosphere to within 1-2$^{\prime\prime}$ (rms), while back-end optics provide further image stabilization down to 0.05$^{\prime\prime}$ (not discussed here). During the inaugural test flight from Timmins, Canada in September 2015, BIT ADCS pointing and stabilization performed exceptionally, with coarse pointing and target acquisition to within &lt; 0.1$^\circ$ and fine stabilization to 0.68$^{\prime\prime}$ (rms) over long (10-30 minute) integrations. This level of performance was maintained during flight for several tracking runs that demonstrated pointing stability on the sky for more than an hour at a time. To refurbish and improve the system for the three-month flight from New Zealand in 2018, certain modifications to the ADCS need to be made to smooth pointing mode transitions and to correct for internal biases observed during the test flight. Furthermore, the level of autonomy must be increased for future missions to improve system reliability and robustness.",1
19572,0,"Practical Limits in the Sensitivity-Linearity Trade-off for Radio Telescope Front Ends in the HF and VHF-low Bands Radio telescope front ends must have simultaneously low noise and sufficiently-high linearity to accommodate interfering signals. Typically these are opposing design goals. For modern radio telescopes operating in the HF (3-30 MHz) and VHF-low (30-88 MHz) bands, the problem is more nuanced in that front end noise temperature may be a relatively small component of the system temperature, and increased linearity may be required due to the particular interference problems associated with this spectrum. In this paper we present an analysis of the sensitivity-linearity trade off at these frequencies, applicable to existing commercially-available monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) amplifiers in single-ended, differential, and parallelized configurations. This analysis and associated findings should be useful in the design and upgrade of front ends for low frequency radio telescopes. The analysis is demonstrated explicitly for one of the better-performing amplifiers encountered in this study, the Mini-Circuits PGA-103, and is confirmed by hardware measurements. We also present a design based on the Mini-Circuits HELA-10 amplifier, which is better-suited for applications where linearity is a primary concern.",1

The transition is associated with an effective geometric phase which is identified from the paths of the magnetic moments in a spherical geometry. The topological transition presents close similarities between SO(3) and SU(2) cases but features differences in, e.g., the adiabatic limits of the geometric phases, being $2\pi$ and $\pi$ in the classical and the quantum case, respectively.

20067,0,"Stability and chaos in Kustaanheimo-Stiefel space induced by the Hopf fibration The need for the extra dimension in Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (KS) regularization is explained by the topology of the Hopf fibration, which defines the geometry and structure of KS space. A trajectory in Cartesian space is represented by a four-dimensional manifold, called the fundamental manifold. Based on geometric and topological aspects classical concepts of stability are translated to KS language. The separation between manifolds of solutions generalizes the concept of Lyapunov stability. The dimension-raising nature of the fibration transforms fixed points, limit cycles, attractive sets, and Poincar\'e sections to higher-dimensional subspaces. From these concepts chaotic systems are studied. In strongly perturbed problems the numerical error can break the topological structure of KS space: points in a fiber are no longer transformed to the same point in Cartesian space. An observer in three dimensions will see orbits departing from the same initial conditions but diverging in time. This apparent randomness of the integration can only be understood in four dimensions. The concept of topological stability results in a simple method for estimating the time scale in which numerical simulations can be trusted. Ideally all trajectories departing from the same fiber should be KS transformed to a unique trajectory in three-dimensional space, because the fundamental manifold that they constitute is unique. By monitoring how trajectories departing from one fiber separate from the fundamental manifold a critical time, equivalent to the Lyapunov time, is estimated. These concepts are tested on N-body examples: the Pythagorean problem, and an example of field stars interacting with a binary.",1

20202,0,"The Fundamental Plane of the Broad-line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei Broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) mainly arise from gas photoionized by continuum radiation from an accretion disk around a central black hole. The shape of the broad-line profile, described by ${\cal D}_{_{\rm H\beta}}={\rm FWHM}/\sigma_{_{\rm H\beta}}$, the ratio of full width at half maximum to the dispersion of broad H$\beta$, reflects the dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR) and correlates with the dimensionless accretion rate ($\dot{\mathscr{M}}$) or Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$). At the same time, $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$ and $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$ correlate with ${\cal R}_{\rm Fe}$, the ratio of optical Fe II to H$\beta$ line flux emission. Assembling all AGNs with reverberation mapping measurements of broad H$\beta$, both from the literature and from new observations reported here, we find a strong bivariate correlation of the form $\log(\dot{\mathscr{M}},L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd})=\alpha+\beta{\cal D}_{_{\rm H\beta}}+\gamma{\cal R}_{\rm Fe},$ where $\alpha=(2.47,0.31)$, $\beta=-(1.59,0.82)$ and $\gamma=(1.34,0.80)$.

20921,0,"The Atlas3D project -- XXXI. Nuclear radio emission in nearby early-type galaxies We present the results of a high-resolution, 5 GHz, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array study of the nuclear radio emission in a representative subset of the Atlas3D survey of early-type galaxies (ETGs). We find that 51 +/- 4% of the ETGs in our sample contain nuclear radio emission with luminosities as low as 10^18 W/Hz. Most of the nuclear radio sources have compact (&lt; 25-110 pc) morphologies, although &lt; 10% display multi-component core+jet or extended jet/lobe structures. Based on the radio continuum properties, as well as optical emission line diagnostics and the nuclear X-ray properties, we conclude that the majority of the central 5 GHz sources detected in the Atlas3D galaxies are associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, even at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution, the nuclear radio emission in some cases appears to arise from low-level nuclear star formation rather than an AGN, particularly when molecular gas and a young central stellar population is present. This is in contrast to popular assumptions in the literature that the presence of a compact, unresolved, nuclear radio continuum source universally signifies the presence of an AGN. Additionally, we examine the relationships between the 5 GHz luminosity and various galaxy properties including the molecular gas mass and - for the first time - the global kinematic state. We discuss implications for the growth, triggering, and fueling of radio AGNs, as well as AGN-driven feedback in the continued evolution of nearby ETGs.",1

In SUSHI a dual-frequency probe laser interacts with atoms in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, then beats against a bright local oscillator beam traversing the other arm, resulting in two simultaneous, independent heterodyne measurements of the atom-induced phase shift. Measurement noise due to mechanical disturbances of beam paths is strongly rejected by the technique of \emph{active subtraction} in which anti-noise is actively written onto the local oscillator beam via an optical phase-locked-loop. In SUSHI, technical noise due to phase, amplitude, and frequency fluctuations of the various laser fields is strongly rejected (i) for any mean phase bias between the interferometer arms, (ii) without the use of piezo actuated mirrors, and (iii) without signal balancing. We experimentally demonstrate an ultra-low technical noise limited sensitivity of 51 nrad$/\sqrt{\R{Hz}}$ over a measurement bandwidth of 60 Hz to 8 kHz using a 230 $\mu$W probe, and stay within $\sim$3 dB of the standard quantum limit as probe power is reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude to as low as 650 pW.

21014,0,"LOFAR facet calibration LOFAR, the Low-Frequency Array, is a powerful new radio telescope operating between 10 and 240 MHz. LOFAR allows detailed sensitive high-resolution studies of the low-frequency radio sky. At the same time LOFAR also provides excellent short baseline coverage to map diffuse extended emission. However, producing high-quality deep images is challenging due to the presence of direction dependent calibration errors, caused by imperfect knowledge of the station beam shapes and the ionosphere. Furthermore, the large data volume and presence of station clock errors present additional difficulties. In this paper we present a new calibration scheme, which we name facet calibration, to obtain deep high-resolution LOFAR High Band Antenna images using the Dutch part of the array. This scheme solves and corrects the direction dependent errors in a number of facets that cover the observed field of view. Facet calibration provides close to thermal noise limited images for a typical 8 hr observing run at $\sim$ 5arcsec resolution, meeting the specifications of the LOFAR Tier-1 northern survey.",1

21053,0,"The spectacular evolution of Supernova 1996al over 15 years: a low energy explosion of a stripped massive star in a highly structured environment Spectrophotometry of SN 1996al carried out throughout 15 years is presented. The early photometry suggests that SN 1996al is a Linear type-II supernova, with an absolute peak of Mv ~ -18.2 mag. Early spectra present broad, asymmetric Balmer emissions, with super-imposed narrow lines with P-Cygni profile, and He I features with asymmetric, broad emission components. The analysis of the line profiles shows that the H and He broad components form in the same region of the ejecta. By day +142, the Halpha profile dramatically changes: the narrow P-Cygni profile disappears, and the Halpha is fitted by three emission components, that will be detected over the remaining 15 yrs of the SN monitoring campaign. Instead, the He I emissions become progressively narrower and symmetric. A sudden increase in flux of all He I lines is observed between 300 and 600 days. Models show that the supernova luminosity is sustained by the interaction of low mass (~1.15 Msun) ejecta, expelled in a low kinetic energy (~ 1.6 x 10^50 erg) explosion, with highly asymmetric circumstellar medium. The detection of Halpha emission in pre-explosion archive images suggests that the progenitor was most likely a massive star (~25 Msun ZAMS) that had lost a large fraction of its hydrogen envelope before explosion, and was hence embedded in a H-rich cocoon. The low-mass ejecta and modest kinetic energy of the explosion are explained with massive fallback of material into the compact remnant, a 7-8 Msun black hole.",1
21091,0,"Fidelity decay and entropy production in many-particle systems after random interaction quench We analyze the effect of spin degree of freedom on fidelity decay and entropy production of a many-particle fermionic(bosonic) system in a mean-field, quenched by a random two-body interaction preserving many-particle spin $S$. The system Hamiltonian is represented by embedded Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (EGOE) of random matrices (for time-reversal and rotationally invariant systems) with one plus two-body interactions preserving $S$ for fermions/bosons. EGOE are paradigmatic models to study the dynamical transition from integrability to chaos in interacting many-body quantum systems. A simple general picture, in which the variances of the eigenvalue density play a central role, is obtained for describing the short-time dynamics of fidelity decay and entropy production. Using some approximations, an EGOE formula for the time ($t_{sat}$) for the onset of saturation of entropy, is also derived. These analytical EGOE results are in good agreement with numerical calculations. Moreover, both fermion and boson systems show significant spin dependence on the relaxation dynamics of the fidelity and entropy.",1

21182,0,"MPS degeneration formula for quiver moduli and refined GW/Kronecker correspondence Motivated by string-theoretic arguments Manschot, Pioline and Sen discovered a new remarkable formula for the Poincare polynomial of a smooth compact moduli space of stable quiver representations which effectively reduces to the abelian case (i.e. thin dimension vectors). We first prove a motivic generalization of this formula, valid for arbitrary quivers, dimension vectors and stabilities. In the case of complete bipartite quivers we use the refined GW/Kronecker correspondence between Euler characteristics of quiver moduli and Gromov-Witten invariants to identify the MPS formula for Euler characteristics with a standard degeneration formula in Gromov-Witten theory. Finally we combine the MPS formula with localization techniques, obtaining a new formula for quiver Euler characteristics as a sum over trees, and constructing many examples of explicit correspondences between quiver representations and tropical curves.",1
21188,0,"Stellar mass functions: methods, systematics and results for the local Universe We present a comprehensive method for determining stellar mass functions, and apply it to samples in the local Universe. We combine the classical 1/Vmax approach with STY, a parametric maximum likelihood method and SWML, a non-parametric maximum likelihood technique. In the parametric approach, we are assuming that the stellar mass function can be modelled by either a single or a double Schechter function and we use a likelihood ratio test to determine which model provides a better fit to the data. We discuss how the stellar mass completeness as a function of z biases the three estimators and how it can affect, especially the low mass end of the stellar mass function. We apply our method to SDSS DR7 data in the redshift range from 0.02 to 0.06. We find that the entire galaxy sample is best described by a double Schechter function with the following parameters: $\log (M^{*}/M_\odot) = 10.79 \pm 0.01$, $\log (\Phi^{*}_1/\mathrm{h^3\ Mpc^{-3}}) = -3.31 \pm 0.20$, $\alpha_1 = -1.69 \pm 0.10$, $\log (\Phi^{*}_2/\mathrm{h^3\ Mpc^{-3}}) = -2.01 \pm 0.28$ and $\alpha_2 = -0.79 \pm 0.04$. We also use morphological classifications from Galaxy Zoo and halo mass, overdensity, central/satellite, colour and sSFR measurements to split the galaxy sample into over 130 subsamples. We determine and present the stellar mass functions and the best fit Schechter function parameters for each of these subsamples.",1
21243,0,"Physical and Electrochemical Area Determination of Electrodeposited Ni, Co, and NiCo Thin Films The surface area of electrodeposited thin films of Ni, Co, and NiCo was evaluated using electrochemical double-layer capacitance, electrochemical area measurements using the [Ru(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{3+}$/[Ru(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{2+}$ redox couple, and topographic atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. These three methods were compared to each other for each composition separately and for the entire set of samples regardless of composition. Double-layer capacitance measurements were found to be positively correlated to the roughness factors determined by AFM topography. Electrochemical area measurements were found to be less correlated with measured roughness factors as well as applicable only to two of the three compositions studied. The results indicate that in situ double-layer capacitance measurements are a practical, versatile technique for estimating the accessible surface area of a metal sample.",1
21252,0,"Contextuality and Nonlocality in Decaying Multipartite Systems Everyday experience supports the existence of physical properties independent of observation in strong contrast to the predictions of quantum theory. In particular, existence of physical properties that are independent of the measurement context is prohibited for certain quantum systems. This property is known as contextuality. This paper studies whether the process of decay in space-time generally destroys the ability of revealing contextuality. We find that in the most general situation the decay property does not diminish this ability. However, applying certain constraints due to the space-time structure either on the time evolution of the decaying system or on the measurement procedure, the criteria revealing contextuality become inherently dependent on the decay property or an impossibility. In particular, we derive how the context-revealing setup known as Bell's nonlocality tests changes for decaying quantum systems. Our findings illustrate the interdependence between hidden and local hidden parameter theories and the role of time.",1
21414,0,"HELP : The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project &amp; The Coming of Age of Multi-Wavelength Astrophysics How did galaxies form and evolve? This is one of the most challenging questions in astronomy today. Answering it requires a careful combination of observational and theoretical work to reliably determine the observed properties of cosmic bodies over large portions of the distant Universe on the one hand, and accurately model the physical processes driving their evolution on the other. Most importantly, it requires bringing together disparate multi-wavelength and multi-resolution spectro-photometric datasets in an homogeneous and well-characterized manner so that they are suitable for a rigorous statistical analysis. The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) funded by the EC FP7 SPACE program aims to achieve this goal by combining the expertise of optical, infrared and radio astronomers to provide a multi-wavelength database for the distant Universe as an accessible value-added resource for the astronomical community. It will do so by bringing together multi-wavelength datasets covering the 1000 deg$^2$ mapped by Herschel extragalactic surveys in an homogeneous and well-characterized manner, creating a joint lasting legacy from several ambitious sky surveys.",1

21498,0,"$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Topological Index for Continuous Photonic Materials Electronic topological insulators are one of the breakthroughs of the 21st century condensed matter physics. So far, the search for a light counterpart of an electronic topological insulator has remained elusive. This is due to the fundamentally different natures of light and matter and the different spins of photons and electrons. Here, it is shown that the theory of electronic topological insulators has a genuine analogue in the context of light wave propagation in time-reversal invariant continuous materials. We introduce a Gauge invariant $Z_2$ index that depends on the global properties of the photonic band structure and is robust to any continuous weak variation of the material parameters that preserves the time-reversal invariance. A nontrivial $Z_2$ index has two possible causes: (i) the lack of smoothness of the pseudo-Hamiltonian in the ${\bf{k}} \to \infty$ limit, and (ii) the entanglement between positive and negative frequency eigenmode branches. In particular, it is proven that electric-type plasmas and magnetic-type plasmas are topologically inequivalent for a fixed wave polarization. We propose a bulk-edge correspondence that links the number of edge modes with the topological invariants of two continuous bulk materials, and present detailed numerical examples that illustrate the application of the theory.",1
21628,0,"Mercury (Hg) in meteorites: variations in abundance, thermal release profile, mass-dependent and mass-independent isotopic fractionation We have measured the concentration, isotopic composition and thermal release profiles of Mercury (Hg) in a suite of meteorites, including both chondrites and achondrites. We find large variations in Hg concentration between different meteorites (ca. 10 ppb to 14'000 ppb), with the highest concentration orders of magnitude above the expected bulk solar system silicates value. From the presence of several different Hg carrier phases in thermal release profiles (150 to 650 {\deg}C), we argue that these variations are unlikely to be mainly due to terrestrial contamination. The Hg abundance of meteorites shows no correlation with petrographic type, or mass-dependent fractionation of Hg isotopes. Most carbonaceous chondrites show mass-independent enrichments in the odd-numbered isotopes 199Hg and 201Hg. We show that the enrichments are not nucleosynthetic, as we do not find corresponding nucleosynthetic deficits of 196Hg. Instead, they can partially be explained by Hg evaporation and redeposition during heating of asteroids from primordial radionuclides and late-stage impact heating. Non-carbonaceous chondrites, most achondrites and the Earth do not show these enrichments in vapor-phase Hg. All meteorites studied here have however isotopically light Hg ({\delta}202Hg = ~-7 to -1) relative to the Earth's average crustal values, which could suggest that the Earth has lost a significant fraction of its primordial Hg. However, the late accretion of carbonaceous chondritic material on the order of ~2%, which has been suggested to account for the water, carbon, nitrogen and noble gas inventories of the Earth, can also contribute most or all of the Earth's current Hg budget. In this case, the isotopically heavy Hg of the Earth's crust would have to be the result of isotopic fractionation between surface and deep-Earth reservoirs.",1
21742,0,"Fundaments of Quaternionic Clifford Analysis II: Splitting of Equations Quaternionic Clifford analysis is a recent new branch of Clifford analysis, a higher dimensional function theory which refines harmonic analysis and generalizes to higher dimension the theory of holomorphic functions in the complex plane. So-called quaternionic monogenic functions satisfy a system of first order linear differential equations expressed in terms of four interrelated Dirac operators. The conceptual significance of quaternionic Clifford analysis is unraveled by showing that quaternionic monogenicity can be characterized by means of generalized gradients in the sense of Stein and Weiss. At the same time, connections between quaternionic monogenic functions and other branches of Clifford analysis, viz Hermitian monogenic and standard or Euclidean monogenic functions are established as well.",1
21774,0,"Auto-Tuning Dedispersion for Many-Core Accelerators In this paper, we study the parallelization of the dedispersion algorithm on many-core accelerators, including GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA, and the Intel Xeon Phi. An important contribution is the computational analysis of the algorithm, from which we conclude that dedispersion is inherently memory-bound in any realistic scenario, in contrast to earlier reports. We also provide empirical proof that, even in unrealistic scenarios, hardware limitations keep the arithmetic intensity low, thus limiting performance. We exploit auto-tuning to adapt the algorithm, not only to different accelerators, but also to different observations, and even telescopes. Our experiments show how the algorithm is tuned automatically for different scenarios and how it exploits and highlights the underlying specificities of the hardware: in some observations, the tuner automatically optimizes device occupancy, while in others it optimizes memory bandwidth. We quantitatively analyze the problem space, and by comparing the results of optimal auto-tuned versions against the best performing fixed codes, we show the impact that auto-tuning has on performance, and conclude that it is statistically relevant.",1

21979,0,"Stellar Tidal Streams in External Galaxies To place the highly substructured stellar halos of the Milky Way and M31 in a larger context of hierarchical galaxy formation, it is necessary to understand the prevalence and properties of tidal substructure around external galaxies. This chapter details the current state of our observational knowledge of streams in galaxies in and beyond the Local Group, which are studied both in resolved stellar populations and in integrated light. Modeling of individual streams in extragalactic systems is hampered by our inability to obtain resolved stellar kinematics in the streams, though many streams contain alternate luminous kinematic tracers, such as globular clusters or planetary nebulae. We compare the observed structures to the predictions of models of galactic halo formation, which provide insight in the number and properties of streams expected around Milky Way like galaxies. More specifically, we discuss the inferences that can be made about stream progenitors based only on observed morphologies. We expand our discussion to consider hierarchical accretion at lower mass scales, in particular the observational evidence that substructure exists on smaller mass scales and the effects accretion events may have on the evolution of dwarf galaxies (satellite or isolated). Lastly, we discuss potential correlations between the presence of substructure in the halo and the structural properties of the disk. While many exciting discoveries have been made of tidal substructures around external galaxies, the ""global"" questions of galaxy formation and evolution via hierarchical accretion await a more complete census of the low surface brightness outskirts of galaxies in and beyond the Local Group.",1
22061,0,"Self-Organization and Heating by Inward Diffusion in Magnetospheric Plasmas Through the process of inward diffusion, a strongly localized clump of plasma is created in a magnetosphere. The creation of the density gradient, instead of the usual flattening by a diffusion process, can be explained by the topological constraints given by the adiabatic invariants of magnetized particles. After developing a canonical formalism for the standard guiding center dynamics in a dipole magnetic field, we complete our attempt to build a statistical mechanics on a constrained phase space by discussing the construction principles of the associated diffusion operator. We then investigate the heating mechanism associated with inward diffusion: as particles move toward regions of higher magnetic field, they experience preferential heating of the perpendicular (with respect to the magnetic field) temperature in order to preserve the magnetic moment. A relationship between conservation of bounce action and temperature isotropy emerged. We further show that this behavior is scaled by the diffusion parameter of the Fokker-Planck equation. These results are confirmed by numerical simulations.",1

We study the transition between correlated and uncorrelated particle states in the framework of one-dimensional Hubbard model driven by a field. We show that the long time-scale transfer rate from an initial correlated state to final uncorrelated particle states is sensitive to the quench field strength and exhibits a periodic behavior. This process involves an irreversible energy transfer from the field to particles, leading to a quantum electrothermal effect.",1

22156,0,"Coupling of alpha-channeling to parallel wavenumber upshift in lower hybrid current drive Although lower hybrid waves have been shown to be effective in driving plasma current in present-day tokamaks, they are predicted to strongly interact with the energetic alpha particles born from fusion reactions in eventual tokamak reactors. However, in the presence of the expected steep alpha particle birth gradient, this interaction can produce wave amplification rather than wave damping. Here, we identify the flexibilities and constraints in achieving this amplification effect through a consideration of symmetries in the channeling interaction, in the wave propagation, and in the tokamak field configuration. Interestingly, for standard LH current drive that supports the poloidal magnetic field, we find that wave amplification through alpha channeling is fundamentally coupled to the poorly understood parallel wavenumber upshift. In so doing, we show that wave launch from the tokamak high-field side is favorable both for alpha-channeling and for achieving the parallel wavenumber upshift.",1
22181,0,"Quantum pumping induced by disorder in one dimension The topological property in one dimension (1D) is protected by symmetry. Based on a concrete model, we show that since a 1D topological model usually contain two of the three Pauli matrix, the left one automatically become the protecting symmetry. We study the effect of disorder preserving or breaking the symmetry and show the nature of symmetry protecting in the 1D topological phase. Based on the 1D topological model, a stable quantum pumping can be constructed, which is topologically nontrivial and can be characterized by the Chern number. By calculating the instantaneous local current we show that an integer charge is pumped across a periodic chain in a cyclic process. Also on an open chain, an edge state can be transferred to the other edge by the quantum pumping. Furthermore we find that not only the quantum pumping is stable to on-site disorder, but also can be induced by it. These results may be realized experimentally using quasicrystals.",1

This absorber was added to the fused silica anti-reflection coating attached to previously-characterized, 20-element prototype arrays of LEKIDs fabricated from thin-film aluminum on silicon substrates. To test the TiN crosstalk absorber, we compared the measured response and noise properties of LEKID arrays with and without the TiN mesh. For this test, the LEKIDs were illuminated with an adjustable, incoherent electronic millimeter-wave source. Our measurements show that the optical crosstalk in the LEKID array with the TiN absorber is reduced by 66\% on average, so the approach is effective and a viable candidate for future kilo-pixel arrays.",1

23057,0,"On sharp rates and analytic compactifications of asymptotically conical K\""ahler metrics Let $X$ be a complex manifold and $S\hookrightarrow X$ be an embedding of complex submanifold. Assuming that the embedding is $(k-1)$-linearizable or $(k-1)$-comfortably embedded, we construct via the deformation to the normal cone a diffeomorphism $F$ from a small neighborhood of the zero section in the normal bundle $N_{S}$ to a small neighborhood of $S$ in $X$ such that $F$ is in a precise sense holomorphic to the $(k-1)$-th order. Using this $F$ we obtain optimal estimates on asymptotical rates for asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics constructed by Tian-Yau. Furthermore, when $S$ is an ample divisor satisfying an appropriate cohomological condition, we relate the order of comfortable embedding to the weight of the deformation of the normal isolated cone singularity arising from the deformation to the normal cone. We also give an example showing that the condition of comfortable embedding depends on the splitting liftings. We then prove an analytic compactification result for the deformation of the complex structure on a complex cone that decays to any positive order at infinity. This can be seen as an analytic counterpart of Pinkham's result on deformations of cone singularities with negative weights.",1

Here we outline components of the SKA science analysis pipeline being developed to produce a series of data products including continuum images, spectral cubes and Faraday depth spectra.

The ground-state EE increases logarithmically as function of number of generation if a single branch is pruned off the tree, while it grows exponentially if the region around the root is trimmed. On the other hand, in both cases the highly excited states' EE grows exponentially. Implications of these results to general graphs and disordered systems are shortly discussed.",1

There are recent proposals, based on Floquet analyses, that one can generate topologically nontrivial insulators by periodically driving topologically trivial ones. Here we address what happens if one follows the dynamics in such systems. Specifically, we present an exact study of the time evolution of a graphene-like system subjected to a circularly polarized electric field. We prove that, for infinite (translationally invariant) systems, the Chern number is conserved under unitary evolution. For systems with boundaries, on the other hand, we show that a properly defined topological invariant, the Bott index, can change. Hence, it should be possible to experimentally prepare topological states starting from non-topological ones. We show that the chirality of the edge current in such systems can be controlled by adjusting the filling.",1

23530,0,"The galaxy UV luminosity function at z ~ 2 - 4; new results on faint-end slope and the evolution of luminosity density We present a new, robust measurement of the evolving rest-frame UV galaxy luminosity function (LF) over the key redshift range z = 2 - 4. Our results are based on the high dynamic range provided by combining the HUDF, CANDELS/GOODS-South, and UltraVISTA/COSMOS surveys. We utilise the unparalleled multi-frequency photometry available in this survey `wedding cake' to compile complete galaxy samples at z ~ 2,3,4 via photometric redshifts (calibrated against the latest spectroscopy) rather than colour-colour selection, and to determine accurate rest-frame UV absolute magnitudes from SED fitting. Our new determinations of the UV LF extend from M_{1500} ~ -22 down to M_{1500} = -14.5, -15.5 and -16 at z ~ 2, 3 and 4 respectively (thus reaching ~ 3 - 4 magnitudes fainter than previous blank-field studies at z ~ 2 - 3). At z ~ 2 - 3 we find a much shallower faint-end slope (alpha = -1.32 +- 0.03) than the steeper values (alpha ~ -1.7) reported by Reddy &amp; Steidel (2009) or by Alavi et al. (2014), and show that this new measurement is robust. By z ~ 4 the faint-end slope has steepened slightly, to alpha = -1.43 +- 0.04, and we show that these measurements are consistent with the overall evolutionary trend from z = 0 to z = 8. Finally, we find that while characteristic number density (phi*) drops from z ~ 2 to z ~ 4, characteristic luminosity (M*) brightens by ~ 1 mag over this redshift range. This, combined with the new flatter faint-end slopes, has the consequence that UV luminosity density (and hence unobscured star-formation density) peaks at z ~ 2.5 - 3, when the Universe was ~ 2.5 Gyr old.",1

We use the high-resolution \textsl{Hubble Space Telescope} (\textsl{HST}) F555W- and F814W-band imaging and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy of this system, which consists of a close galaxy pair with a projected separation of $\approx 4.2$ kpc at $z_{\rm lens} \sim 0.331$ lensing a Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{\rm source} = 2.701$. Comparisons between the mass peaks inferred from lens models and light peaks from \textsl{HST} imaging data reveal significant spatial mass/light offsets as large as $1.72 \pm 0.24 \pm 0.34$ kpc in both filter bands. Such large mass/light offsets, not seen in isolated field lens galaxies and relaxed galaxy groups, may be related to the interactions between the two lens galaxies. The detected mass/light offsets can potentially serve as an important test for the self-interacting dark matter model. However, other mechanisms such as dynamical friction on spatially differently distributed dark matter and stars could produce similar offsets. Detailed hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy-galaxy interactions with self-interacting dark matter could accurately quantify the effects of different mechanisms. The background LAE is found to contain three distinct star-forming knots with characteristic sizes from 116 pc to 438 pc. It highlights the power of strong gravitational lensing in probing the otherwise too faint and unresolved structures of distance objects below subkiloparsec or even 100 pc scales through its magnification effect.",1
23886,0,"The initial abundance and distribution of 92Nb in the Solar System Niobium-92 is an extinct proton-rich nuclide, which decays to 92Zr with a half-life of 37 Ma. This radionuclide potentially offers a unique opportunity to determine the timescales of early Solar System processes and the site(s) of nucleosynthesis for p-nuclei, once its initial abundance and distribution in the Solar System are well established. Here we present internal Nb-Zr isochrons for three basaltic achondrites with known U-Pb ages: the angrite NWA 4590, the eucrite Agoult, and the ungrouped achondrite Ibitira. Our results show that the relative Nb-Zr isochron ages of the three meteorites are consistent with the time intervals obtained from the Pb-Pb chronometer for pyroxene and plagioclase, indicating that 92Nb was homogeneously distributed among their source regions. The Nb-Zr and Pb-Pb data for NWA 4590 yield the most reliable and precise reference point for anchoring the Nb-Zr chronometer to the absolute timescale: an initial 92Nb/93Nb ratio of $(1.4 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-5}$ at $4557.93 \pm 0.36$ Ma, which corresponds to a 92Nb/93Nb ratio of $(1.7 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-5}$ at the time of the Solar System formation. On the basis of this new initial ratio, we demonstrate the capability of the Nb-Zr chronometer to date early Solar System objects including troilite and rutile, such as iron and stony-iron meteorites. Furthermore, we estimate a nucleosynthetic production ratio of 92Nb to the p-nucleus 92Mo between 0.0015 and 0.035. This production ratio, together with the solar abundances of other p-nuclei with similar masses, can be best explained if these light p-nuclei were primarily synthesized by photodisintegration reactions in Type Ia supernovae.",1

Therefore, the control and engineering of the properties of each spatial mode is essential. Despite the multimodeness of our waveguide, the well-established Fabry-Perot technique for recording fringes in the optical transmission spectrum can successfully be employed for a detailed linear optical characterization when combined with Fourier analysis. A prerequisite for the modal sensitivity is a finely resolved transmission spectrum that is recorded over a broad frequency band.

The mode-resolved measurements are important for optimizing the performance of such multimode waveguides by tailoring the properties of their spatial modes.",1
24088,0,"A high-resolution pointing system for fast scanning platforms: The EBEX example The E and B experiment (EBEX) is a balloon-borne telescope designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background with 8' resolution employing a gondola scanning with speeds of order degree per second. In January 2013, EBEX completed 11 days of observations in a flight over Antarctica covering $\sim$ 6000 square degrees of the sky. The payload is equipped with two redundant star cameras and two sets of three orthogonal gyroscopes to reconstruct the telescope attitude. The EBEX science goals require the pointing to be reconstructed to approximately 10"" in the map domain, and in-flight attitude control requires the real time pointing to be accurate to $\sim$ 0.5$^{\circ}$ . The high velocity scan strategy of EBEX coupled to its float altitude only permits the star cameras to take images at scan turnarounds, every $\sim$ 40 seconds, and thus requires the development of a pointing system with low noise gyroscopes and carefully controlled systematic errors. Here we report on the design of the pointing system and on a simulation pipeline developed to understand and minimize the effects of systematic errors. The performance of the system is evaluated using the 2012/2013 flight data, and we show that we achieve a pointing error with RMS=25"" on 40 seconds azimuth throws, corresponding to an error of $\sim$ 4.6"" in the map domain.",1

24396,0,"Thermal noise and optomechanical features in the emission of a membrane-coupled compound cavity laser diode We demonstrate the use of a compound optical cavity as linear displacement detector, by measuring the thermal motion of a silicon nitride suspended membrane acting as the external mirror of a near-infrared Littrow laser diode. Fluctuations in the laser optical power induced by the membrane vibrations are collected by a photodiode integrated within the laser, and then measured with a spectrum analyzer. The dynamics of the membrane driven by a piezoelectric actuator is investigated as a function of air pressure and actuator displacement in a homodyne configuration. The high Q-factor ($\sim 3.4\cdot 10^4$ at $8.3 \cdot 10^{-3}$ mbar) of the fundamental mechanical mode at $\sim 73$ kHz guarantees a detection sensitivity high enough for direct measurement of thermal motion at room temperature ($\sim 87$ pm RMS).

24591,0,"Dirac electrons in the presence of matrix potential barrier: application to graphene and topological insulators Scattering of a 2D Dirac electrons on a rectangular matrix potential barrier is considered using the formalism of spinor transfer matrices. It is shown, in particular, that in the absence of the mass term, the Klein tunneling is not necessarily suppressed but occurs at oblique incidence. The formalism is applied to studying waveguiding modes of the barrier, which are supported by the edge and bulk states. The condition of existence of the uni-directionality property is found. We show that the band of edge states is always finite with massless excitations, while the spectrum of the bulk states, depending on parameters of the barrier, may consist of the infinite or finite band with both, massive and massless, low-energy excitations. The effect of the Zeeman term is considered and the condition of appearance of two distinct energy dependent directions corresponding to the Klein tunneling is found.",1
24607,0,"2-D studies of Relativistic electron beam plasma instabilities in an inhomogeneous plasma Relativistic electron beam propagation in plasma is fraught with several micro instabilities like two stream, filamentation etc., in plasma. This results in severe limitation of the electron transport through a plasma medium. Recently, however, there has been an experimental demonstration of improved transport of Mega Ampere of electron currents (generated by the interaction of intense laser with solid target) in a carbon nanotube structured solid target [Phys. Rev Letts. 108, 235005 (2012)]. This then suggests that the inhomogeneous plasma (created by the ionization of carbon nano tube structured target) helps in containing the growth of the beam plasma instabilities. This manuscript addresses this issue with the help of a detailed analytical study and simulations with the help of 2-D Particle - In - Cell code. The study conclusively demonstrates that the growth rate of the dominant instability in the 2-D geometry decreases when the plasma density is chosen to be inhomogeneous, provided the scale length 1/ks of the inhomogeneous plasma is less than the typical plasma skin depth (c/{\omega}p0 ) scale. At such small scale lengths channelization of currents are also observed in simulation.",1

The extension is performed independently for high and low frequencies. High-frequency extension uses the excitation-filter model. Extension of the excitation is performed in the time domain using a non-linear function, while the spectral envelope is extended in the cepstral domain using a multi-layer perceptron. Low-band extension is based on the sinusoidal model. The amplitude of sinusoids is also estimated using a multi-layer perceptron. The results show that the sound quality after extension is higher than that of narrowband speech, with a significant variation across listeners.

24848,0,"Black hole formation and growth with non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations Quasars powered by massive black holes (BHs) with mass estimates above a billion solar masses have been identified at redshift 6 and beyond. The existence of such BHs requires almost continuous growth at the Eddington limit for their whole lifetime, of order of one billion years. In this paper, we explore the possibility that positively skewed scale-dependent non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations may ease the assembly of massive BHs. In particular, they produce more low-mass halos at high redshift, thus altering the production of metals and ultra-violet flux, believed to be important factors in BH formation. Additionally, a higher number of progenitors and of nearly equal-mass halo mergers would boost the mass increase provided by BH-BH mergers and merger-driven accretion. We use a set of two cosmological simulations, with either Gaussian or scale-dependent non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations to perform a proof-of-concept experiment to estimate how BH formation and growth are altered. We estimate the BH number density and the fraction of halos where BHs form, for both simulations and for two popular scenarios of BH formation (remnants of the first generation of stars and direct collapse in the absence of metals and molecular hydrogen). We find that the fractions of halos where BHs form are almost identical, but that non-Gaussian primordial perturbations increase the total number density of BHs for the both BH formation scenarios. We also evolve BHs using merger trees extracted from the simulations and find that non-Gaussianities increase both the BH masses and the number of the most massive BHs.",1
24911,0,"Space-charge effects in high-energy photoemission Pump-and-probe photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) with femtosecond pulsed sources opens new perspectives in the investigation of the ultrafast dynamics of physical and chemical processes at the surfaces and interfaces of solids. Nevertheless, for very intense photon pulses a large number of photoelectrons are simultaneously emitted and their mutual Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently strong to significantly modify their trajectory and kinetic energy. This phenomenon, referred as space-charge effect, determines a broadening and shift in energy for the typical PES structures and a dramatic loss of energy resolution. In this article we examine the effects of space charge in PES with a particular focus on time-resolved hard X-ray (~10 keV) experiments. The trajectory of the electrons photoemitted from pure Cu in a hard X-ray PES experiment has been reproduced through $N$-body simulations and the broadening of the photoemission core-level peaks has been monitored as a function of various parameters (photons per pulse, linear dimension of the photon spot, photon energy). The energy broadening results directly proportional to the number $N$ of electrons emitted per pulse (mainly represented by secondary electrons) and inversely proportional to the linear dimension $a$ of the photon spot on the sample surface, in agreement with the literature data about ultraviolet and soft X-ray experiments. The evolution in time of the energy broadening during the flight of the photoelectrons is also studied. Despite its detrimental consequences on the energy spectra, we found that space charge has negligible effects on the momentum distribution of photoelectrons and a momentum broadening is not expected to affect angle-resolved experiments. Strategy to reduce the energy broadening and the feasibility of hard X-ray PES experiments at the new free-electron laser facilities are discussed.",1
24953,0,"Observation of Weyl nodes and Fermi arcs in TaP A Weyl semimetal possesses spin-polarized band-crossings, called Weyl nodes, connected by topological surface arcs. The low-energy excitations near the crossing points behave the same as massless Weyl fermions, leading to exotic properties like chiral anomaly. To have the transport properties dominated by Weyl fermions, Weyl nodes need to locate nearly at the chemical potential and enclosed by pairs of individual Fermi surfaces with nonzero Fermi Chern numbers. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculation, here we show that TaP is a Weyl semimetal with only single type of Weyl fermions, topologically distinguished from TaAs where two types of Weyl fermions contribute to the low-energy physical properties. The simple Weyl fermions in TaP are not only of fundamental interests but also of great potential for future applications. Fermi arcs on the Ta-terminated surface are observed, which appear in a different pattern from that on the As-termination in TaAs and NbAs.",1

25063,0,"Measurement and modeling of polarized specular neutron reflectivity in large magnetic fields The presence of a large applied magnetic field removes the degeneracy of the vacuum energy states for spin-up and spin-down neutrons. For polarized neutron reflectometry, this must be included in the reference potential energy of the Schr\""odinger equation that is used to calculate the expected scattering from a magnetic layered structure. For samples with magnetization that is purely parallel or antiparallel to the applied field which defines the quantization axis, there is no mixing of the spin states (no spin-flip scattering) and so this additional potential is constant throughout the scattering region. When there is non-collinear magnetization in the sample however, there will be significant scattering from one spin state into the other and the reference potentials will differ between the incoming and outgoing wavefunctions, changing the angle and intensities of the scattering. The theory of the scattering and recommended experimental practices for this type of measurement are presented, as well as an example measurement.",1

This equivalence is governed by the monodromy of the abelian additive difference equations defined by the commuting fields of Y_h(g). Our results are compatible with q-characters, and apply more generally to a symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebra g, in particular to affine Yangians and quantum toroidal algebras.

25146,0,"On the temporal wavefunction in quantum physics - a short note Experiments involving single or few elementary particles are completely described by Quantum Mechanics. Notwithstanding the success of that quantitative description, various aspects of observations, as nonlocality and the statistical randomness of results, remain as mysterious properties apart from the quantum theory, and they are attributed to the strangeness of the microscopic world. Here we restart from the fundamental relations of uncertainty to reformulate the probability law of Born including the temporal variable. Considering that both the spatial and the temporal variables play a symmetric role in the wave-function \Psi (x,t) , a temporal wavepacket is built and analysed. The probability density is written as p(x,t) = | \Psi (x,t) |^2, where the probabilistic interpretation for the temporal wavepacket is equivalent to Born's law for the spatial variable, x. For the convenience of the discussion of the role of the temporal variable, we write p(x_0,t) = | \Psi (x_0,t) |^2 for a free particle, expressing only the temporal wavepacket, then we discuss its spread. In the light of the evolution of this temporal wavepacket we analyse basic processes of matter-wave interaction, involving single and entangled entities. Nonlocality appears then as a consequence of the spread of the temporal wavepacket; and the position of each detected event in two-slits interferometry as due to the independent phases of the spatial and temporal wavepackets.",1

We show that it is simply the difference between the weak value of the canonical momentum of a charged particle in the presence and absence of magnetic field. This suggests that the vector potential is not only a physical entity but can be measured directly in the experiment.",1

This study sought to develop a framework for the adoption of biometric ATMs in the Kenyan banking sector, apply the developed framework to study factors influencing adoption of biometric ATM authentication and validate the developed conceptual framework. A survey was used to collect quantitative data from the ATM users which was then analysed using factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. The study established that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy were key determinants for biometric ATMs acceptance, adoption and usage.

25789,0,"Theory of the Integer and Fractional Quantum Hall Effects The present theory has investigated the FQHE without any quasi-particle. The electric field due to the Hall voltage is taken into consideration. We find the ground state where the electron configuration is uniquely determined so as to have the minimum classical Coulomb energy. Residual Coulomb interaction HI yields quantum transitions which satisfy the momentum conservation along the current direction. The number of Coulomb transitions from nearest electron pairs is dependent sensitively upon the fractional number of the filling factor. For example, the number u(2/3) of allowed transitions at nu=2/3 abruptly decreases when the filling factor nu deviates slightly from 2/3. The limiting value of the number is equal to half of u(2/3). The discontinuous behavior produces the valley structure in the energy spectrum. This mechanism produces the Hall plateaus at the specific filling factors nu=1/(2j+1), 2j /(2j+1), j/(2j+1), j/(2j-1) etc. and also at the non-standard filling factors nu=7/11, 4/11, 4/13, 5/13, 5/17, 6/17 etc. We have studied the pair energies of more distant electron pairs in Chapter 5. Thereby the small valley structure yields at nu=5/2, 7/2 and so on. The shapes of polarization curves depend mainly upon the numerator of the fractional filling factor in nu&lt;1 because the spin polarization belongs to electrons only. There are many spin-arrangements with the same eigen-energy of HD. The Coulomb interaction HI yields quantum transitions among these degenerate ground states. The partial Hamiltonian has been diagonalized exactly. The eigen-states give the spin polarization versus magnetic field strength. The theoretical curves of the spin polarization are in good agreement with the experimental data as studied in Chapter 9. Thus the present theory has well explained the various phenomena of the FQHE.",1

Through laser and plasma parameter control, without compromise of generation efficiency, a linearly polarized laser pulse with azimuth $\theta^i=10^\circ$ can generate an elliptically polarized attosecond burst with azimuth $|\theta^r_{\rm atto}|\approx61^\circ$ and ellipticity $\sigma^r_{\rm atto}\approx0.27$; while an elliptically polarized laser pulse with $\sigma^i\approx0.36$ can generate an almost circularly polarized attosecond burst with $\sigma^r_{\rm atto}\approx0.95$.

26262,0,"A correlation between the HI 21-cm absorption strength and impact parameter in external galaxies By combining the data from surveys for HI 21-cm absorption at various impact parameters in near-by galaxies, we report an anti-correlation between the 21-cm absorption strength (velocity integrated optical depth) and the impact parameter. Also, by combining the 21-cm absorption strength with that of the emission, giving the neutral hydrogen column density, we find no evidence that the spin temperature of the gas (degenerate with the covering factor) varies significantly across the disk. This is consistent with the uniformity of spin temperature measured across the Galactic disk. Furthermore, comparison with the Galactic distribution suggests that intervening 21-cm absorption preferentially arises in disks of high inclinations (near face-on). We also investigate the hypothesis that 21-cm absorption is favourably detected towards compact radio sources. Although there is insufficient data to determine whether there is a higher detection rate towards quasar, rather than radio galaxy, sight-lines, the 21-cm detections intervene objects with a mean turnover frequency of 5 x 10^8 Hz, compared to 1 x 10^8 Hz for the non-detections. Since the turnover frequency is anti-correlated with radio source size, this does indicate a preferential bias for detection towards compact background radio sources.",1
26351,0,"Enhanced resolution in Argon and Neon spectra using a Super-Resolution algorithm This paper presents the principles and application of a super-resolution (SR) technique, based on a L1-Norm minimization procedure. In particular, the technique is applied to improve low-resolution resolution spectra as obtained from the optogalvanic effect in Neon and Argon discharges over the 413-423 nm wavelength range. By applying the super-resolution algorithm to the experimental data, a surprising 70-fold reduction of the linewidth is achieved allowing to resolve prior indistinguishable peaks. It is found that further improvements on the resolution are limited by the signal to noise ratio of the original spectra. The importance of a suitable mathematical representation of the experiment and the discussion on other applications of this super-resolution technique in spectroscopy are also presented.",1
26365,0,"Supernova feedback in a local vertically stratified medium: interstellar turbulence and galactic winds We use local Cartesian simulations with a vertical gravitational potential to study how supernova (SN) feedback in stratified galactic discs drives turbulence and launches galactic winds. Our analysis includes three disc models with gas surface densities ranging from Milky Way-like galaxies to gas-rich ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and two different SN driving schemes (random and correlated with local gas density). In order to isolate the physics of SN feedback, we do not include additional feedback processes. We find that, in these local box calculations, SN feedback excites relatively low mass-weighted gas turbulent velocity dispersions ~3-7 km/s and low wind mass loading factors &lt; 1 in all the cases we study. The low turbulent velocities and wind mass loading factors predicted by our local box calculations are significantly below those suggested by observations of gas-rich and rapidly star-forming galaxies; they are also in tension with global simulations of disc galaxies regulated by stellar feedback. Using a combination of numerical tests and analytic arguments, we argue that local Cartesian boxes cannot predict the properties of galactic winds because they do not capture the correct global geometry and gravitational potential of galaxies. The wind mass loading factors are in fact not well-defined in local simulations because they decline significantly with increasing box height. More physically realistic calculations (e.g., including a global galactic potential and disc rotation) will likely be needed to fully understand disc turbulence and galactic outflows, even for the idealized case of feedback by SNe alone.",1

It is known that by tailoring the potential energy of the insulating system, one can force a phase transition into another insulating phase.

26580,0,"High-extinction VIPA-based Brillouin spectroscopy of turbid biological media Brillouin microscopy has recently emerged as powerful technique to characterize the mechanical properties of biological tissue, cell and biomaterials. However, the potential of Brillouin microscopy is currently limited to transparent samples, because Brillouin spectrometers do not have sufficient spectral extinction to reject the predominant non-Brillouin scattered light of turbid media. To overcome this issue, we developed a spectrometer composed of a two VIPA stages and a multi-pass Fabry-Perot interferometer. The Fabry-Perot etalon acts as an ultra-narrow band-pass filter for Brillouin light with high spectral extinction and low loss. We report background-free Brillouin spectra from Intralipid solutions and up to 100 microns deep within chicken muscle tissue.",1
26789,0,"A way to discover Maxwell's equations theoretically The Coulomb force, established in the rest frame of a source-charge $Q$, when transformed to a new frame moving with a velocity $\vec{V}$ has a form $\vec{F}= q\vec{{E}} + q\vec{v} \times \vec{{B}}$, where $\vec{{E}}=\vec{E}'_\parallel + \gamma\vec{E}'_\perp $ and $\vec{{B}}= \vec{\frac{V}{c^2}} \times \vec{{E}}$ and $\vec{E}'$ is the electric field in the rest frame of the source. The quantities $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are then manifestly interdependent. We prove that they are determined by Maxwell's equations, so they represent the electric and magnetic fields in the new frame and the force $\vec{F}$ is the well known from experiments Lorentz force. In this way Maxwell's equations may be discovered theoretically for this particular situation of uniformly moving sources. The general solutions of the discovered Maxwell's equations lead us to fields produced by accelerating sources.",1

These results are generalized for higher order curvature invariants. In particular, the notion of mixed higher order mean curvature is introduced to highlight the special null geometry of the submanifold.

The derivation follows from a functional integral representation of the partition function in terms of charge density fluctuations. Starting from the mean-field solution given by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, an original approach is proposed to numerically sample fluctuations around it, through the propagation of a Langevin like stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The diffusion tensor of the SPDE can be chosen so as to avoid the numerical complexity linked to long-range Coulomb interactions, effectively rendering the theory completely local. A finite-volume implementation of the SPDE is described, and the approach is illustrated with preliminary results on the study of a system made of two like-charge ions immersed in a bath of counter-ions.",1

With very low or even zero doping near the Dirac points, i.e., two inequivalent valleys, this TSC has a Chern number as large as four, which supports four Majorana edge modes. More importantly, we show that this TSC has a robust topologically nontrivial bulk excitation gap, which can be larger or even one order of magnitude larger than the proximity-induced superconducting gap. This unique property paves a way for the application of QAH insulators as seed materials to realize robust TSCs and Majorana modes.",1
27590,0,"Spontaneous emergence of non-planar electron orbits during direct laser acceleration by a linearly polarized laser pulse An electron irradiated by a linearly polarized relativistic intensity laser pulse in a cylindrical plasma channel can gain significant energy from the pulse. The laser electric and magnetic fields drive electron oscillations in a plane making it natural to expect the electron trajectory to be flat. We show that strong modulations of the relativistic $\gamma$-factor associated with the energy enhancement cause the free oscillations perpendicular to the plane of the driven motion to become unstable. As a consequence, out of plane displacements grow to become comparable to the amplitude of the driven oscillations and the electron trajectory becomes essentially three-dimensional, even if at an early stage of the acceleration it was flat. The development of the instability profoundly affects the x-ray emission, causing considerable divergence of the radiation perpendicular to the plane of the driven oscillations, while also reducing the overall emitted energy.",1
27625,0,"Failure of the Volume Function in Granular Statistical Mechanics and an Alternative Formulation We first show that the currently accepted statistical mechanics for granular matter is flawed. The reason is that it is based on the volume function, which depends only on a minute fraction of all the structural degrees of freedom and is unaffected by most of the configurational microstates. Consequently, the commonly used partition function underestimates the entropy severely. We then propose a new formulation, replacing the volume function with a ${\it connectivity}$ function that depends on all the structural degrees of freedom and accounts correctly for the entire entropy. We discuss the advantages of the new formalism and derive explicit results for two- and three-dimensional systems. We test the formalism by calculating the entropy of an experimental two-dimensional system, as a function of system size, and showing that it is an extensive variable.",1

27721,0,"X-Ray Detection of Warm Ionized Matter in the Galactic Halo We report on a systematic investigation of the cold and mildly ionized gaseous baryonic metal components of our Galaxy, through the analysis of high resolution Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra of two samples of Galactic and extragalactic sources. The comparison between lines of sight towards sources located in the disk of our Galaxy and extragalactic sources, allows us for the first time to clearly distinguish between gaseous metal components in the disk and halo of our Galaxy. We find that a Warm Ionized Metal Medium (WIMM) permeates a large volume above and below the Galaxy's disk, perhaps up to the Circum-Galactic space (CGM). This halo-WIMM imprints virtually the totality of the OI and OII absorption seen in the spectra of our extragalactic targets, has a temperature of T(Halo-WIMM)=2900 +/- 900 K, a density (Halo-WIMM) = 0.023 +/- 0.009 cm-3 and a metallicity Z(Halo-WIMM) = (0.4 +/- 0.1) Z_Solar. Consistently with previous works, we also confirm that the disk of the Galaxy contains at least two distinct gaseous metal components, one cold and neutral (the CNMM: Cold Neutral Metal Medium) and one warm and mildly ionized, with the same temperature of the Halo-WIMM, but higher density ((Disk-WIMM) = 0.09 +/- 0.03 cm-3) and metallicity (Z(Disk-WIMM) = 0.8 +/- 0.1$ Z_Solar).

27895,0,"Galactic cosmic rays on extrasolar Earth-like planets: II. Atmospheric implications (abridged abstract) Theoretical arguments indicate that close-in terrestial exoplanets may have weak magnetic fields. As described in the companion article (Paper I), a weak magnetic field results in a high flux of galactic cosmic rays to the top of the planetary atmosphere. We investigate effects that may result from a high flux of galactic cosmic rays both throughout the atmosphere and at the planetary surface. Using an air shower approach, we calculate how the atmospheric chemistry and temperature change under the influence of galactic cosmic rays for Earth-like (N_2-O_2 dominated) atmospheres. We evaluate the production and destruction rate of atmospheric biosignature molecules. We derive planetary emission and transmission spectra to study the influence of galactic cosmic rays on biosignature detectability. We then calculate the resulting surface UV flux, the surface particle flux, and the associated equivalent biological dose rates. We find that up to 20% of stratospheric ozone is destroyed by cosmic-ray protons. The reduction of the planetary ozone layer leads to an increase in the weighted surface UV flux by two orders of magnitude under stellar UV flare conditions. The resulting biological effective dose rate is, however, too low to strongly affect surface life. We also examine the surface particle flux: For a planet with a terrestrial atmosphere, a reduction of the magnetic shielding efficiency can increase the biological radiation dose rate by a factor of two. For a planet with a weaker atmosphere (with a surface pressure of 97.8 hPa), the planetary magnetic field has a much stronger influence on the biological radiation dose, changing it by up to two orders of magnitude.",1

An understanding of the noise and confusion properties of GLEAM is essential if we are to fully exploit GLEAM data and improve the design of future low-frequency surveys. Our early results indicate that sidelobe confusion dominates over the entire frequency range, implying that enhancements in data processing have the potential to further reduce the noise.",1

28611,0,"Super-Eddington Stellar Winds Driven by Near-Surface Energy Deposition We develop analytic and numerical models of the properties of super-Eddington stellar winds, motivated by phases in stellar evolution when super-Eddington energy deposition (via, e.g., unstable fusion, wave heating, or a binary companion) heats a region near the stellar surface. This appears to occur in luminous blue variables (LBVs), Type IIn supernovae progenitors, classical novae, and X-ray bursts. We show that when the wind kinetic power exceeds Eddington, the photons are trapped and behave like a fluid. Convection does not play a significant role in the wind energy transport. The wind properties depend on the ratio of a characteristic speed in the problem vc ~ (Edot G)^{1/5} (where Edot is the heating rate) to the stellar escape speed near the heating region vesc(r_h). For vc &gt; vesc(r_h) the wind kinetic power at large radii Edot_w ~ Edot. For vc &lt; vesc(r_h), most of the energy is used to unbind the wind material and thus Edot_w &lt; Edot. Multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations without radiation diffusion using FLASH and one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with radiation diffusion using MESA are in good agreement with the analytic predictions. The photon luminosity from the wind is itself super-Eddington but in many cases the photon luminosity is likely dominated by `internal shocks' in the wind. We discuss the application of our models to eruptive mass loss from massive stars and argue that the wind models described here can account for the broad properties of LBV outflows and the enhanced mass loss in the years prior to Type IIn core-collapse supernovae.",1

Features distinguishing bIQH edges include a current imbalance to chemical potential bias ratio that is quantized despite the lack of conductance quantization in the bIQH edges themselves.

Here, we describe this phenomenon, characterize it with averages and correlation functions, and interpret it as the result of decorrelation of the impulse-response function of interstellar scattering between the widely-separated antennas. This instrument included the 10-m Space Radio Telescope, the 110-m Green Bank Telescope, the 14x25-m Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and the 64-m Kalyazin Radio Telescope. The observations were performed at 324 MHz, on baselines of up to 235,000 km in November 2012 and January 2014. In the delay domain, on long baselines the interferometric visibility consists of many discrete spikes within a limited range of delays. On short baselines it consists of a sharp spike surrounded by lower spikes. The average envelope of correlations of the visibility function show two exponential scales, with characteristic delays of $\tau_1=4.1\pm 0.3\ \mu{\rm s}$ and $\tau_2=23\pm 3\ \mu{\rm s}$, indicating the presence of two scales of scattering in the interstellar medium. These two scales are present in the pulse-broadening function. The longer scale contains 0.38 times the scattered power of the shorter one. We suggest that the longer tail arises from highly-scattered paths, possibly from anisotropic scattering or from substructure at large angles.",1
28849,0,"Noise-Compensated, Bias-Corrected Diffusion Weighted Endorectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging via a Stochastically Fully-Connected Joint Conditional Random Field Model Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MR) is a powerful tool in imaging-based prostate cancer screening and detection. Endorectal coils are commonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity inhomogeneities (bias field) that worsens as we move away from the endorectal coil. The presence of bias field can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of different image analysis tasks, as well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to increased inter- and intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction approaches are introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared to the prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and anatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed retrospective bias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise amplification that can reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image. Here, we propose a unified data reconstruction approach that enables joint compensation of bias field as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging. The proposed noise-compensated, bias-corrected (NCBC) data reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel stochastically fully connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model to mitigate the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR data. The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR data, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using endorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis illustrated that the proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image quality when compared to other tested bias correction methods. As such, the proposed NCBC method may have potential as a useful retrospective approach for improving the consistency of image interpretations.",1

29112,0,"Multi-source self-calibration: Unveiling the microJy population of compact radio sources Context. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data are extremely sensitive to the phase stability of the VLBI array. This is especially important when we reach {\mu}Jy r.m.s. sensitivities. Calibration using standard phase referencing techniques is often used to improve the phase stability of VLBI data but the results are often not optimal. This is evident in blank fields that do not have in-beam calibrators. Aims. We present a calibration algorithm termed Multi-Source Self-Calibration (MSSC) which can be used after standard phase referencing on wide-field VLBI observations. This is tested on a 1.6 GHz wide-field VLBI data set of the Hubble Deep Field-North and the Hubble Flanking Fields. Methods. MSSC uses multiple target sources detected in the field via standard phase referencing techniques and modifies the visibili- ties so that each data set approximates to a point source. These are combined to increase the signal to noise and permit self-calibration. In principle, this should allow residual phase changes caused by the troposphere and ionosphere to be corrected. By means of faceting, the technique can also be used for direction dependent calibration. Results. Phase corrections, derived using MSSC, were applied to a wide-field VLBI data set of the HDF-N comprising of 699 phase centres. MSSC was found to perform considerably better than standard phase referencing and single source self-calibration. All detected sources exhibited dramatic improvements in dynamic range. Using MSSC, one source reached the detection threshold taking the total detected sources to twenty. 60% of these sources can now be imaged with uniform weighting compared to just 45% with standard phase referencing. The Parseltongue code which implements MSSC has been released and made publicly available to the astronomical community (https://github.com/jradcliffe5/multi_self_cal).",1

Nevertheless, the techniques used in that paper were specific to ${\boldsymbol T}_{4}$ and cannot be adapted to analyse Fr\'echet means in the space ${\boldsymbol T}_{m}$ of phylogenetic trees with $m(\geqslant5)$ leaves. To investigate the latter, this paper first studies the log map of ${\boldsymbol T}_{m}$, a generalisation of the inverse of the exponential map on a Riemannian manifold. Then, in terms of a modified version of the log map, we characterise Fr\'echet means in ${\boldsymbol T}_{m}$ that lie in top-dimensional or co-dimension one strata. We derive the limiting distributions for the corresponding sample Fr\'echet means, generalising our previous results. In particular, the results show that, although they are related to the Gaussian distribution, the forms taken by the limiting distributions depend on the co-dimensions of the strata in which the Fr\'echet means lie.",1
29481,0,"Simulation Platform for Multi Agent Based Manufacturing Control System Based on The Hybrid Agent Agent based distributed manufacturing control and scheduling systems are subsets of new manufacturing systems. Multi agent systems (MAS) not only drive design and engineering control solutions but also influence flexibility, agility, and re-configurability, which makes MASs a better centralized systems than its traditional counterparts. However, implementation of all MASs in the real factories are timely, also extremely costly. A simulation environment that would allow independent development and testing of the services and business processes of the related manufacturing hardware is needed. This paper presents the design and implementation of a userfriendly simulation platform for multi agent based manufacturing control systems by considering the shop floor level. The proposed simulation platform can simulate the software level of the factory by considering the hardware level of the mentioned factory. An example of the simulation platform is presented for a flexible manufacturing system, which is located in EMU CIM lab.",1

29558,0,"Double occupancy in DMFT and the Dual Boson approach We discuss the calculation of the double occupancy using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) in finite dimensions. The double occupancy can be determined from the susceptibility of the auxiliary impurity model or from the lattice susceptibility. The former method underestimates, whereas the latter overestimates the double occupancy. We illustrate this for the square-lattice Hubbard model. We propose an approach for which both methods lead to identical results by construction and which resolves this ambiguity. This self-consistent dual boson scheme results in a double occupancy that is numerically close to benchmarks available in the literature.",1

29639,0,"Convergence of the Gutt Star Product: A strict Deformation Quantization This work is the final version of my master thesis. Many, but not all of its key results are already available as a preprint with Chiara Esposito and Stefan Waldmann on arxiv.org under the title ""Convergence of the Gutt Star Product"", which has been submitted to a journal. The main goal of this work is to understand a certain deformation of the commutative product on the symmetric tensor algebra over a given (locally convex) Lie algebra in a topological setting. Therefore, the tensor algebra over the Lie algebra is topologized in a locally convex manner. This finally provides a new example of a strict deformation quantization, i.e. a continuous star product. The related formal star product was found by Simone Gutt and is therefore called the Gutt star product. Together with this star product, the symmetric tensor algebra is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra. Hence, this work also presents an explicit locally convex topology on the universal enveloping algebra of certain locally convex Lie algebras. Since this construction has good functorial properties, it is also an interesting object of study not only in quantization and quantum group theory, but also in Lie theory.",1

Any final hypersurface that will be generated by STEVE is guaranteed to be free from accidental rifts, i.e., it always fully encloses a region in the 4D space under consideration. Furthermore, the information of the interior/exterior of the enclosed regions is propagated to each one of the tetrahedrons, which are embedded into 4D and which in their union represent the final, iso-valued hypersurface(s).

The observations were conducted between 2012 and 2016. The total time span of 1126 days was split into five epochs due to the hardware changes to the observing system.

30119,0,"Strong Ly alpha Emission in the Proximate Damped Ly alpha Absorption Trough toward the Quasar SDSS J095253.83+011422.0 SDSS J095253.83+011422.0 (SDSS J0952+0114) was reported by Hall et al. (2004) as an exotic quasar at $z_{\rm em}=3.020$. In contrast to prominent broad metal--line emissions with FWHM~9000 km/s, only a narrow Ly \alpha emission line is present with FWHM~1000 km/s. The absence of broad Ly alpha emission line has been a mystery for more than a decade. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is due to dark Proximate Damped Ly alpha Absorption (PDLA) at $z_{\rm abs}=3.010$ by identifying associated Lyman absorption line series from the damped Ly beta up to Ly9, as well as the Lyman limit absorption edge. The PDLA cloud has a column density of $\log N_{\rm H\,I}({\rm cm}^{-2})=21.8\pm0.2$, a metallicity of [Zn/H]$&gt;-1.0$, and a spatial extent exceeding the Narrow Emission Line Region (NELR) of the quasar. With a luminosity of $L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the residual Ly alpha emission superposed on the PDLA trough is of two orders of magnitude stronger than previous reports. This is best explained as re-radiated photons arising from the quasar outflowing gas at a scale larger than the NELR. The PDLA here, acting like a natural coronagraph, provides us with a good insight into the illuminated gas in the vicinity of the quasar, which are usually hard to resolve due to their small size and ""seeing fuzz"" of bright quasars. Notably, SDSS J0952+0114 analogs might be easily omitted in the spectroscopic surveys of DLAs and PDLAs, as their damped Ly alpha troughs can be fully filled by additional strong Ly alpha emissions. Our preliminary survey shows that such systems are not very rare. They are potentially a unique sample for probing strong quasar feedback phenomena in the early universe.",1
30122,0,"Symmetric and asymmetric solitons in dual-core couplers with competing quadratic and cubic nonlinearities We consider the model of a dual-core spatial-domain coupler with chi^(2) and chi^(3) nonlinearities acting in two parallel cores. We construct families of symmetric and asymmetric solitons in the system with self-defocusing chi^(3) terms, and test their stability. The transition from symmetric to asymmetric soliton branches, and back to the symmetric ones proceeds via a bifurcation loop. A pair of stable asymmetric branches emerge from the symmetric family via a supercritical bifurcation; eventually, the asymmetric branches merge back into the symmetric one through a reverse bifurcation. The existence of the loop is explained by means of an extended version of the cascading approximation for the chi^(2) interaction, which takes into regard the XPM part of the chi(3) interaction. When the inter-core coupling is weak, the bifurcation loop features a concave shape, with the asymmetric branches losing their stability at the turning points. In addition to the two-color solitons, which are built of the fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) components, in the case of the self-focusing chi^(3) nonlinearity we also consider single-color solitons, which contain only the SH component, but may be subject to the instability against FF perturbations. Asymmetric single-color solitons are always unstable, whereas the symmetric ones are stable, provided that they do not coexist with two-color counterparts. Collisions between tilted solitons are studied too.",1
30138,0,"Efficiency of a Multi-Reference Coupled Cluster method The multi-reference Coupled Cluster method first proposed by Meller et al (J. Chem. Phys. 1996) has been implemented and tested. Guess values of the amplitudes of the single and double excitations (the ${\hat T}$ operator) on the top of the references are extracted from the knowledge of the coefficients of the Multi Reference Singles and Doubles Configuration Interaction (MRSDCI) matrix. The multiple parentage problem is solved by scaling these amplitudes on the interaction between the references and the Singles and Doubles. Then one proceeds to a dressing of the MRSDCI matrix under the effect of the Triples and Quadruples, the coefficients of which are estimated from the action of ${\hat T}^2$. This dressing follows the logics of the intermediate effective Hamiltonian formalism. The dressed MRSDCI matrix is diagonalized and the process is iterated to convergence. The method is tested on a series of benchmark systems from Complete Active Spaces (CAS) involving 2 or 4 active electrons up to bond breakings. The comparison with Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) results shows that the errors are of the order of a few milli-hartree, five times smaller than those of the CASSDCI. The method is totally uncontracted, parallelizable, and extremely flexible since it may be applied to selected MR and/or selected SDCI. Some potential generalizations are briefly discussed.",1
30153,0,"Massive and massless Dirac fermions in Pb1-xSnxTe topological crystalline insulator probed by magneto-optical absorption Dirac fermions in condensed matter physics hold great promise for novel fundamental physics, quantum devices and data storage applications. IV-VI semiconductors, in the inverted regime, have been recently shown to exhibit massless topological surface Dirac fermions protected by crystalline symmetry, as well as massive bulk Dirac fermions. Under a strong magnetic field (B), both surface and bulk states are quantized into Landau levels that disperse as B^1/2, and are thus difficult to distinguish. In this work, magneto-optical absorption is used to probe the Landau levels of high mobility Bi-doped Pb0.54Sn0.46Te topological crystalline insulator (111)-oriented films. The high mobility achieved in these thin film structures allows us to probe and distinguish the Landau levels of both surface and bulk Dirac fermions and extract valuable quantitative information about their physical properties.

30526,0,"A 5x10^9 Solar Mass Black Hole in NGC 1277 from Adaptive Optics Spectroscopy The nearby lenticular galaxy NGC 1277 is thought to host one of the largest black holes known, however the black hole mass measurement is based on low spatial resolution spectroscopy. In this paper, we present Gemini Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrometer observations assisted by adaptive optics. We map out the galaxy's stellar kinematics within ~440 pc of the nucleus with an angular resolution that allows us to probe well within the region where the potential from the black hole dominates. We find that the stellar velocity dispersion rises dramatically, reaching ~550 km/s at the center. Through orbit-based, stellar-dynamical models we obtain a black hole mass of (4.9 \pm 1.6) x 10^9 Msun (1-sigma uncertainties). Although the black hole mass measurement is smaller by a factor of ~3 compared to previous claims based on large-scale kinematics, NGC 1277 does indeed contain one of the most massive black holes detected to date, and the black hole mass is an order of magnitude larger than expectations from the empirical relation between black hole mass and galaxy luminosity. Given the galaxy's similarities to the higher redshift (z~2) massive quiescent galaxies, NGC 1277 could be a relic, passively evolving since that period. A population of local analogs to the higher redshift quiescent galaxies that also contain over-massive black holes may suggest that black hole growth precedes that of the host galaxy.",1

We conjecture that the massive Brownian loop soup describes the zero level lines of the massive Gaussian free field, and discuss possible relations to other models, such as Ising, in the off-critical regime.",1
30589,0,"A view on coupled cluster perturbation theory using a bivariational Lagrangian formulation We consider two distinct coupled cluster (CC) perturbation series that both expand the difference between the energies of the CCSD (CC with single and double excitations) and CCSDT (CC with single, double, and triple excitations) models in orders of the M{\o}ller-Plesset fluctuation potential. We initially introduce the E-CCSD(T-$n$) series, in which the CCSD amplitude equations are satisfied at the expansion point, and compare it to the recently developed CCSD(T-$n$) series [J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108 (2014)], in which not only the CCSD amplitude, but also the CCSD multiplier equations are satisfied at the expansion point. The computational scaling is similar for the two series, and both are term-wise size extensive with a formal convergence towards the CCSDT target energy. However, the two series are different, and the CCSD(T-$n$) series is found to exhibit a more rapid convergence up through the series, which we trace back to the fact that more information at the expansion point is utilized than for the E-CCSD(T-$n$) series. The present analysis can be generalized to any perturbation expansion representing the difference between a parent CC model and a higher-level target CC model. In general, we demonstrate that, whenever the parent parameters depend upon the perturbation operator, a perturbation expansion of the CC energy (where only parent amplitudes are used) differs from a perturbation expansion of the CC Lagrangian (where both parent amplitudes and parent multipliers are used). For the latter case, the bivariational Lagrangian formulation becomes more than a convenient mathematical tool, since it facilitates a different and faster convergent perturbation series than the simpler energy-based expansion.",1
30601,0,"Exploring the 2MASS Extended and Point Source Catalogs with Clustering Redshifts The Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) has mapped out the low-redshift Universe down to $K_S\sim14$ mag. As its near-infrared photometry primarily probes the featureless Rayleigh-Jeans tail of galaxy spectral energy distributions, colour-based redshift estimation is rather uninformative. Until now, redshift estimates for this dataset have relied on optical follow-up suffering from selection biases. Here we use the newly-developed technique of clustering-based redshift estimation to infer the redshift distribution of the 2MASS sources regardless of their optical properties. We characterise redshift distributions of objects from the Extended Source Catalogue as a function of near-infrared colours and brightness and report some observed trends. We also apply the clustering redshift technique to dropout populations, sources with non-detections in one or more near-infrared bands, and present their redshift distributions. Combining all extended sources, we confirm with clustering redshifts that the distribution of this sample extends up to $z\sim0.35$. % We perform a similar analysis with the Point Source Catalogue and show that it can be separated into stellar and extragalactic contributions with galaxies reaching $z\sim0.7$. We estimate that the Point Source Catalogue contains 1.6 million extragalactic objects: as many as in the Extended Source Catalogue but probing a cosmic volume ten times larger.",1

30941,0,"Nanoscale femtosecond imaging of transient hot solid density plasmas with elemental and charge state sensitivity using resonant coherent diffraction Here we propose to exploit the low energy bandwidth, small wavelength and penetration power of ultrashort pulses from XFELs for resonant Small Angle Scattering (SAXS) on plasma structures in laser excited plasmas. Small angle scattering allows to detect nanoscale density fluctuations in forward scattering direction. Typically, the SAXS signal from laser excited plasmas is expected to be dominated by the free electron distribution. We propose that the ionic scattering signal becomes visible when the X-ray energy is in resonance with an electron transition between two bound states (Resonant coherent X-ray diffraction, RCXD). In this case the scattering cross-section dramatically increases so that the signal of X-ray scattering from ions silhouettes against the free electron scattering background which allows to measure the opacity and derived quantities with high spatial and temporal resolution, being fundamentally limited only by the X-ray wavelength and timing. Deriving quantities such as ion spatial distribution, charge state distribution and plasma temperature with such high spatial and temporal resolution will make a vast number of processes in shortpulse laser-solid interaction accessible for direct experimental observation e.g. hole-boring and shock propagation, filamentation and instability dynamics, electron transport, heating and ultrafast ionization dynamics.",1
31005,0,"Thick Presentism and Newtonian Mechanics In the present paper I argue that the formalism of Newtonian mechanics stems directly from the general principle to be called the principle of microlevel reducibility which physical systems obey in the realm of classical physics.

Second, it postulates that any physical system is nothing but an ensemble of structureless particles arranged in some whose interaction obeys the superposition principle. I substantiate this statement and demonstrate directly how the formalism of differential equations, the notion of forces in Newtonian mechanics, the concept of phase space and initial conditions, the principle of least actions, etc. result from the principle of microlevel reducibility.

31061,0,"Quasars can be used to verify the parallax zero-point of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution Context. The Gaia project will determine positions, proper motions, and parallaxes for more than one billion stars in our Galaxy. It is known that Gaia's two telescopes are affected by a small but significant variation of the basic angle between them. Unless this variation is taken into account during data processing, e.g. using on-board metrology, it causes systematic errors in the astrometric parameters, in particular a shift of the parallax zero-point. Previously, we suggested an early reduction of Gaia data for the subset of Tycho-2 stars (Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution; TGAS). Aims. We aim to investigate whether quasars can be used to independently verify the parallax zero-point already in early data reductions. This is not trivially possible as the observation interval is too short to disentangle parallax and proper motion for the quasar subset. Methods. We repeat TGAS simulations but additionally include simulated Gaia observations of quasars from ground-based surveys. All observations are simulated with basic angle variations. To obtain a full astrometric solution for the quasars in TGAS we explore the use of prior information for their proper motions. Results. It is possible to determine the parallax zero-point for the quasars with a few {\mu}as uncertainty, and it agrees to a similar precision with the zero-point for the Tycho-2 stars. The proposed strategy is robust even for quasars exhibiting significant fictitious proper motion due to a variable source structure, or when the quasar subset is contaminated with stars misidentified as quasars. Conclusions. Using prior information about quasar proper motions we could provide an independent verification of the parallax zero-point in early solutions based on less than one year of Gaia data.",1

31296,0,"Evidence for AGN Feedback in the Broad Absorption Lines and Reddening of Mrk 231 We present the first J-band spectrum of Mrk 231, which reveals a large \ion{He}{1}*$\lambda 10830$ broad absorption line with a profile similar to that of the well-known \ion{Na}{1} broad absorption line. Combining this spectrum with optical and UV spectra from the literature, we show that the unusual reddening noted by \citet{veilleux13} is explained by a reddening curve like those previously used to explain low values of total-to-selective extinction in SNe Ia. The nuclear starburst may be the origin and location of the dust. Spatially-resolved emission in the broad absorption line trough suggests nearly full coverage of the continuum emission region. The broad absorption lines reveal higher velocities in the \ion{He}{1}* lines (produced in the quasar-photoionized \ion{H}{2} region) compared with the \ion{Na}{1} and \ion{Ca}{2} lines (produced in the corresponding partially-ionized zone). {\it Cloudy} simulations show that a density increase is required between the \ion{H}{2} and partially-ionized zones to produce ionic column densities consistent with the optical and IR absorption line measurements and limits, and that the absorber lies $\sim 100\rm \, pc$ from the central engine. These results suggest that the \ion{He}{1}* lines are produced in an ordinary quasar BAL wind that impacts upon, compresses, and accelerates the nuclear starburst's dusty effluent (feedback in action), and the \ion{Ca}{2} and \ion{Na}{1} lines are produced in this dusty accelerated gas. This unusual circumstance explains the rarity of \ion{Na}{1} absorption lines; without the compression along our line of sight, Mrk~231 would appear as an ordinary FeLoBAL.",1

We found $\alpha=4.6\times10^{-13}$ ${\rm K^{-1}}$ at 1.6 K. At 16.8 K $\alpha$ vanishes, with a derivative equal to $-6\times10^{-10}$ ${\rm K}^{-2}$. The temperature of the resonator was stabilized to a level below 10 $\mu$K for averaging times longer than 20 s.

The area enclosed by the Fermi surface depends strongly on the in-plane magnetic field component parallel to the Weyl/Dirac node splitting, which leads to unusual behavior in quantum oscillations when the magnetic field is tilted out of the plane.

31470,0,"Induced voltage in an open wire A puzzle arising from Faraday's law is considered and solved concerning the question which voltage is induced in an open wire with a time-varying homogeneous magnetic field. In contrast to closed wires where the voltage is determined by the time variance of magnetic field and enclosed area, in an open wire we have to integrate the electric field along the wire. It is found that the longitudinal electric field contributes with 1/3 and the transverse field with 2/3 to the induced voltage. In order to find the electric fields the sources of the magnetic fields are necessary to know. The representation of a homogeneous and time-varying magnetic field implies unavoidably a certain symmetry point or symmetry line which depend on the geometry of the source. As a consequence the induced voltage of an open wire is found to be the area covered with respect to this symmetry line or point perpendicular to the magnetic field. This in turn allows to find the symmetry points of a magnetic field source by measuring the voltage of an open wire placed with different angles in the magnetic field. We present exactly solvable models for a symmetry point and for a symmetry line, respectively. The results are applicable to open circuit problems like corrosion and for astrophysical applications.",1

The results of such classical interactions motivate a phenomenological quantum description of a propagating laser pulse in a medium in terms of an effective quantum Hamiltonian.,1

Here we describe the data analysis method for China's Chang'E-2 X-ray spectrometer (CE2XRS) in detail and present the preliminary results: the first global Mg/Si and Al/Si maps on the lunar surface. Our results show that the distributions of Mg/Si and Al/Si correlate well with the terrains of the Moon. The higher Mg/Si ratio corresponding to the mare regions while the lower value corresponding to the highland terrains. The map of Al/Si ratio shows a reverse relationship with the map of Mg/Si ratio.,1

Searching for new double quasars in the SDSS-III database, we discovered SDSS J1442+4055. This consists of two bright images (18-19 magnitudes in the r band) of the same distant quasar at redshift z = 2.575. The two quasar images are separated by about 2.1 arcsec, show significant parallel flux variations and can be monitored from late 2015. We also found other two double quasar candidates, SDSS J1617+3827 (z = 2.079) and SDSS J1642+3200 (z = 2.264), displaying evidence for the presence of a lensing object and parallel flux variations, but requiring further spectroscopic observations to be confirmed as lensed quasars.",1

This is quantified by ab initio calculations of the resonant x-ray diffraction at the Ta L1 edge.

31894,0,"Cramer's Rule for Generalized Inverse Solutions of Some Matrices Equations By a generalized inverse of a given matrix, we mean a matrix that exists for a larger class of matrices than the nonsingular matrices, that has some of the properties of the usual inverse, and that agrees with inverse when given matrix happens to be nonsingular. In theory, there are many different generalized inverses that exist. We shall consider the Moore Penrose, weighted Moore-Penrose, Drazin and weighted Drazin inverses. New determinantal representations of these generalized inverse based on their limit representations are introduced in this paper. Application of this new method allows us to obtain analogues classical adjoint matrix. Using the obtained analogues of the adjoint matrix, we get Cramer's rules for the least squares solution with the minimum norm and for the Drazin inverse solution of singular linear systems. Cramer's rules for the minimum norm least squares solutions and the Drazin inverse solutions of the matrix equations ${\rm {\bf A}}{\rm {\bf X}} = {\rm {\bf D}}$, ${\rm {\bf X}}{\rm {\bf B}} = {\rm {\bf D}}$ and ${\rm {\bf A}}{\rm {\bf X}}{\rm {\bf B}} ={\rm {\bf D}} $ are also obtained, where ${\rm {\bf A}}$, ${\rm {\bf B}}$ can be singular matrices of appropriate size.

Although the Lieb-Robinson bound is violated in the strict sense for long-range interacting systems, we illustrate that a major amount of information in this model still propagates ballistically on a light cone. We find a pronounced effect of the interaction range on the decay of the mutual information between spatially disconnected subsystems. A significant amount of information is shared at time-like separations. This regime is accompanied by very slow equilibration of local observables. As the Kitaev model is quasi-free, we illustrate how the distribution of quasi-particle group velocities explains the physics of this system qualitatively.",1

Up to now, position-momentum weak values have been mainly developed for (relativistic) photons. In this Letter, a proposal for the measurement of such weak values in typical electronic devices is presented. Inspired by the Ramo-Shockley-Pellegrini theorem that provides a relation between current and electron velocity, it is shown that the displacement current measured in multiterminal configurations can provide either a weak measurement of the momentum or strong measurement of position. This proposal opens new opportunities for fundamental and applied physics with state-of-the-art electronic technology. As an example, a setup for the measurement of the Bohmian velocity of (nonrelativistic) electrons is presented and tested with numerical experiments.",1
32654,0,"Parity violation in atomic ytterbium: experimental sensitivity and systematics We present a detailed description of the observation of parity violation in the 1S0-3D1 408-nm forbidden transition of ytterbium, a brief report of which appeared earlier. Linearly polarized 408-nm light interacts with Yb atoms in crossed E- and B-fields. The probability of the 408-nm transition contains a parity violating term, proportional to (Elight . B)[(E x Elight) . B], arising from interference between the parity violating amplitude and the Stark amplitude due to the E-field (Elight is the electric field of the light). The transition probability is detected by measuring the population of the 3P0 state, to which 65% of the atoms excited to the 3D1 state spontaneously decay. The population of the 3P0 state is determined by resonantly exciting the atoms with 649-nm light to the 6s7s 3S1 state and collecting the fluorescence resulting from its decay. Systematic corrections due to E-field and B-field imperfections are determined in auxiliary experiments. The statistical uncertainty is dominated by parasitic frequency excursions of the 408-nm excitation light due to imperfect stabilization of the optical reference with respect to the atomic resonance. The present uncertainties are 9% statistical and 8% systematic. Methods of improving the accuracy for the future experiments are discussed.",1

We investigated the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 by air exposure using x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The stoichiometric sample was grown with co-evaporation of PbI2 and CH3NH3I on a Au coated Si wafer.

It was also observed that PbI2 crystallization roughened the film and resulted in a partial exposure of the Au substrate.",1
32794,0,"Vlasov simulation of laser-driven shock acceleration and ion turbulence We present a Vlasov, i.e. a kinetic Eulerian simulation study of nonlinear collisionless ion-acoustic shocks and solitons excited by an intense laser interacting with an overdense plasma. The use of the Vlasov code avoids problems with low particle statistics and allows a validation of particle-in-cell results. A simple original correction to the splitting method for the numerical integration of the Vlasov equation has been implemented in order to ensure the charge conservation in the relativistic regime. We show that the ion distribution is affected by the development of a turbulence driven by the relativistic ""fast"" electron bunches generated at the laser-plasma interaction surface. This leads to the onset of ion reflection at the shock front in an initially cold plasma where only soliton solutions without ion reflection are expected to propagate. We give a simple analytic model to describe the onset of the turbulence as a nonlinear coupling of the ion density with the fast electron currents, taking the pulsed nature of the relativistic electron bunches into account.",1

32807,0,"Hydrodynamic moving-mesh simulations of the common envelope phase in binary stellar systems The common envelope (CE) phase is an important stage in binary stellar evolution. It is needed to explain many close binary stellar systems, such as cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernova progenitors, or X-ray binaries. To form the resulting close binary, the initial orbit has to shrink, thereby transferring energy to the primary giant's envelope that is hence ejected. The details of this interaction, however, are still not understood. Here, we present new hydrodynamic simulations of the dynamical spiral-in forming a CE system. We apply the moving-mesh code AREPO to follow the interaction of a $1M_\odot$ compact star with a $2M_\odot$ red giant possessing a $0.4M_\odot$ core. The nearly Lagrangian scheme combines advantages of smoothed particle hydrodynamics and traditional grid-based hydrodynamic codes and allows us to capture also small flow features at high spatial resolution. Our simulations reproduce the initial transfer of energy and angular momentum from the binary core to the envelope by spiral shocks seen in previous studies, but after about 20 orbits a new phenomenon is observed. Large-scale flow instabilities are triggered by shear flows between adjacent shock layers. These indicate the onset of turbulent convection in the common envelope, thus altering the transport of energy on longer time scales. At the end of our simulation, only 8% of the envelope mass is ejected. The failure to unbind the envelope completely may be caused by processes on thermal time scales or unresolved microphysics.",1
33068,0,"Galactic-Center Hyper-Shell Model for the North Polar Spurs The bipolar-hyper shell (BHS) model for the North Polar Spurs (NPS-E, -W, and Loop I) and counter southern spurs (SPS-E and -W) is revisited based on numerical hydrodynamical simulations. Propagations of shock waves produced by energetic explosive events in the Galactic Center are examined. Distributions of soft X-ray brightness on the sky at 0.25, 0.7, and 1.5 keV in a +/-50 deg x +/-50 deg region around the Galactic Center are modeled by thermal emission from high-temperature plasma in the shock-compressed shell considering shadowing by the interstellar HI and H2 gases. The result is compared with the ROSAT wide field X-ray images in R2, 4 and 6 bands. The NPS and southern spurs are well reproduced by the simulation as shadowed dumbbell-shaped shock waves. We discuss the origin and energetics of the event in relation to the starburst and/or AGN activities in the Galactic Center.

33115,0,"Diversion Detection in Partially Observed Nuclear Fuel Cycle Networks A nuclear fuel cycle contains several facilities with different purposes such as mining, conversion, enrichment, and fuel rod fabrication. These facilities form a network, which is naturally sparse in the number of connections (i.e., edges) since not every facility directly interacts with all the others. Given the knowledge of a network baseline, we are interested in detecting anomalous activities in this network, which may signal the diversion of nuclear materials. Anomalies can take the form of a new or missing edge or abnormal rates of interaction. However, often it is not possible to observe the entire network traffic directly due to some constraints such as cost, physical limitations, or laws. By treating the unobserved network traffic as latent variables, we propose estimators for the true network traffic, including the anomalous activity, to use in testing for significant deviations from the baseline. We provide simulation results of a simple network of facilities and show that our estimators have superior performance over existing alternatives. Additionally, we establish that while a good estimate of the network traffic is necessary, perfect reconstruction is not required to effectively detect anomalous network activity. Instead it suffices to detect perturbations within the network at an aggregate or global scale.",1

By carefully tuning the amplitude and phase relation of the two beams, a broadband unidirectional scattering can be achieved, even at the wavelength where the antenna scatters most efficiently. By moving the focus of one beam, a drastic switch of the unidirectional scattering can be observed. Such scheme enables the design of ultra-compact optical switches and directional couplers based on nanoantennas.",1

The arguments are given that the one-loop Wegner result for a space dimension d=2+\epsilon may appear to be exact, so the multifractal spectrum is strictly parabolical. The \sigma-models are shown to be deficient at the four-loop level and the possible reasons of that are discussed. The extremely slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit is demonstrated. The open question on the relation between multifractality and a spatial dispersion of the diffusion coefficient D(\omega,q) is resolved in the compromise manner due to ambiguity of the D(\omega,q) definition.

Our report has a historical character, but the stress is on the chain of mathematical ideas. We start with the introduction of Riemann surfaces, and we end with the discovery of some of the basic structures of Riemann's moduli space and Teichm{\""u}ller space. We point out several facts which seem to be unknown to many algebraic geometers and analysts working in the theory. The period we are interested in starts with Riemann, in 1851, and ends in the early 1960s, when Ahlfors and Bers confirmed that Teichm{\""u}ller's results were correct.This paper was written for the book ""Lipman Bers, a life in Mathematics,"" edited by Linda Keen , Irwin Kra and Rubi Rodriguez (Amercian Mathematical Society, 2015).

His work on analysis is nevertheless inseparable from geometry and topology. In this survey, we highlight the relations and the logical dependence between this work and the works of Riemann, Poincar{\'e}, Klein, Brouwer, Siegel, Teichm{\""u}ller, Weil, Grothendieck and others.

33511,0,"Firehose constraints for the solar wind suprathermal electrons The indefinite increase of temperature predicted by the solar wind expansion in the direction parallel to the interplanetary magnetic field is already notorious for not being confirmed by the observations. In hot and dilute plasmas from space particle-particle collisions are not efficient in constraining large deviations from isotropy, but the resulting firehose instability provides in this case plausible limitations for the temperature anisotropy of the thermal (core) populations of both the electron and proton species. The present paper takes into discussion the suprathermal (halo) electrons, which are ubiquitous in the solar wind. Less dense but hotter than the core, suprathermals may be highly anisotropic and susceptible to the firehose instability. The main features of the instability are here derived from a first-order theory for conditions specific to the suprathermal electrons in the solar wind and terrestrial magnetospheres. Unveiled here, new regimes of the electron firehose instability may be exclusively controlled by the suprathermals. The instability is found to be systematically stimulated by the suprathermal electrons, with thresholds that approach the limits of the temperature anisotropy reported by the observations. These results represent new and valuable evidences for the implication of the firehose instability in the relaxation of the temperature anisotropy in space plasmas.",1

We use full exact diagonalization to examine the behavior of quantum chaos indicators and of the diagonal matrix elements of operators of interest in the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

Quantum entanglemant is one of the most amazing phenomenon in quantum mechanics that is totally different from classical physics. However, system would interact with environment in the practical quantum information process. The entanglement would be broken. In this paper, we study the disentanglement evolution of three spin qubits in an XY spin-chain environment. The dynamical process of the disentanglement is investigated. We found the exact expression of the coherence factor. We discuss the coherence factor and the parameters, and then we illustrate that the disentanglement of central spins is best enhanced by the quantum critical behavior of the environmental spin chain.

In this paper we demonstrate the technique and efficiency of RFI identification and mitigation for the 21 Centimeter Array (21CMA), a radio interferometer dedicated to the statistical measurement of EoR. For terrestrial, man-made RFI, we concentrate mainly on a statistical approach by identifying and then excising non-Gaussian signatures, in the sense that the extremely weak cosmic signal is actually buried under thermal and therefore Gaussian noise. We also introduce the so-called visibility correlation coefficient instead of conventional visibility, which allows a further suppression of rapidly time-varying RFI. Finally, we briefly discuss removals of the sky RFI, the leakage of sidelobes from off-field strong radio sources with time-invariant power and a featureless spectrum. It turns out that state of the art technique should allow us to detect and mitigate RFI to a satisfactory level in present low frequency interferometer observations such as those acquired with the 21CMA, and the accuracy and efficiency can be greatly improved with the employment of low-cost, high-speed computing facilities for data acquisition and processing.",1

Here we propose and implement an algorithmic framework based on low-rank matrix recovery and alternating minimization that exploits the forward model for THz acquisition. The method allows recovering the original signal in spite of the presence of temporal-spatial distortions. We address a blind-demodulation problem, where based on several observations of the sample texture modulated by an undesired sweep pattern, the two classes of signals are separated.

34772,0,"Regularized Newton Methods for X-ray Phase Contrast and General Imaging Problems Like many other advanced imaging methods, x-ray phase contrast imaging and tomography require mathematical inversion of the observed data to obtain real-space information. While an accurate forward model describing the generally nonlinear image formation from a given object to the observations is often available, explicit inversion formulas are typically not known. Moreover, the measured data might be insufficient for stable image reconstruction, in which case it has to be complemented by suitable a priori information. In this work, regularized Newton methods are presented as a general framework for the solution of such ill-posed nonlinear imaging problems. For a proof of principle, the approach is applied to x-ray phase contrast imaging in the near-field propagation regime. Simultaneous recovery of the phase- and amplitude from a single near-field diffraction pattern without homogeneity constraints is demonstrated for the first time. The presented methods further permit all-at-once phase contrast tomography, i.e. simultaneous phase retrieval and tomographic inversion.

We deal with the complex extension of these representations by using a Gaussian regularization.

The wetting transition is critical (second order) for any finite ratio of surface coupling J_s to bulk coupling J, and turns first order in the limit J_s/J to infinity. However, for J_s/J much larger than 1 the critical region is exponentially small and practically invisible to numerical studies.

Based on its IRAS, ISO, and SCUBA detections, it has long been considered as one of the most intrinsically luminous (L$_{\mathrm{IR}}$ &gt; 10$^{13}$ L$_{\odot}$) infrared sources in the Universe. Recent far-infrared data from the Herschel Space Observatory reveal that most of the flux associated with 3C318 measured with earlier instruments in fact comes from a bright nearby source. Optical imaging and spectroscopy show that this infrared-bright source is a strongly star-forming pair of interacting galaxies at z=0.35. Adding existing Spitzer and SDSS photometry, we perform a spectral energy distribution analysis of the pair, and find that it has a combined infrared luminosity of L$_{\mathrm{IR}}$ = 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, comparable to other intermediate-redshift ultra-luminous infrared galaxies studied with Herschel.

35246,0,"Quantifying noise sources in the KSTAR 2014 Thomson Scattering system from the measured variation on electron temperature With the Thomson scattering (TS) system in KSTAR, temporal evolution of electron temperature ($T_e$) is estimated using a weighted look-up table method with fast sampling ($1.25$ or $2.5$ GS/s) digitizers during the 2014 KSTAR campaign. Background noise level is used as a weighting parameter without considering the photon noise due to the absence of information on absolute photon counts detected by the TS system. Estimated electron temperature during a relatively quiescent discharge are scattered, i.e., $15$\% variation on $T_e$ with respect to its mean value. We find that this $15$\% variation on $T_e$ cannot be explained solely by the background noise level which leads us to include photon noise effects in our analysis. Using synthetic data, we have estimated the required photon noise level consistent with the observation and determined the dominant noise source in KSTAR TS system.",1

35295,0,"False capacitance of supercapacitors Capacitance measurements from cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic chronopotentiometry and calculation of capacitance from imaginary part of impedance are widely used in investigations of supercapacitors. The methods assume the supercapacitor is a capacitor, while real objects correspond to different equivalent electric circuits and show various contributions of non-capacitive currents to the current which is used for calculation of capacitance. Specific capacitances which are presented in F g-1 units in publications not always refer to electric capacitance. The inadequateness of the capacitance characterization has already resulted in groundless attribution to supercapacitors of various systems with electrochemical responses of poorly reversible electrochemical reactions. The number of publications that present false capacitances is terrible and still increases. A widespread neglect of energy dissipation in calculations of specific capacitance leads to further confusion in the characterization of supercapacitors.",1
35312,0,"Wide bandwidth instantaneous RF spectrum analyzer based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond We propose an original analog method to perform instantaneous and quantitative spectral analysis of microwave signals. An ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers held in a diamond plate is pumped by a 532 nm laser. Its photoluminescence is imaged through an optical microscope and monitored by a digital camera. The microwave signal is converted to an oscillating magnetic field in the area of the NV centers by a loop shaped antenna. Induced magnetic resonances are detected through a decrease of the NV centers photoluminescence. A magnetic field gradient induces a Zeeman shift of the resonances and transforms the frequency information into spatial information, which allows for the simultaneous analysis of the microwave signal in the entire frequency bandwidth of the device. The time dependent spectral analysis of an amplitude modulated microwave signal is demonstrated over a bandwidth of 600 MHz, associated to a frequency resolution of 7 MHz and a refresh rate of 4 ms. With such integration time, a field of a few hundreds of {\mu}W can be detected. Since the optical properties of NV centers can be maintained even in high magnetic field, we estimate that an optimized device could allow frequency analysis in a range of 30 GHz, only limited by the amplitude of the magnetic field gradient. In addition, an increase of the NV centers quantity could lead both to an increase of the microwave sensitivity and to a decrease of the minimum refresh rate down to a few {\mu}s.",1

35456,0,"Measurement scheme and analysis for weak ground state hyperfine transition moments through two-pathway coherent control We report our detailed analysis of a table-top system for the measurement of the weak-force-induced electric dipole moment of a ground state hyperfine transition carried out in an atomic beam geometry. We describe an experimental configuration of conductors for application of orthogonal r.f. and static electric fields, with cavity enhancement of the r.f. field amplitude, that allows confinement of the r.f. field to a region in which the static fields are uniform and well-characterized. We carry out detailed numerical simulations of the field modes, and analyze the expected magnitude of statistical and systematic limits to the measurement of this transition amplitude in atomic cesium. The combination of an atomic beam with this configuration leads to strong suppression of magnetic dipole contributions to the atomic signal. The application of this technique to the measurement of extremely weak transition amplitudes in other atomic systems, especially alkali metals, seems very feasible.",1
35535,0,"Is Turbulence in the Interstellar Medium Driven by Feedback or Gravity? An Observational Test Galaxies' interstellar media (ISM) are observed to be supersonically-turbulent, but the ultimate power source that drives turbulent motion remains uncertain. The two dominant models are that the turbulence is driven by star formation feedback and/or that it is produced by gravitational instability in the gas. Here we show that, while both models predict that the galaxies' ISM velocity dispersions will be positively correlated with their star formation rates, the forms of the correlation predicted by these two models are subtly but measurably different. A feedback-driven origin for the turbulence predicts a velocity dispersion that rises more sharply with star formation rate, and that does not depend on the gas fraction (i.e. $\dot{M}_* \propto \sigma^2$), while a gravity-driven model yields a shallower rise and a strong dependence on gas fraction (i.e. $\dot{M}_* \propto f_g^2 \sigma$). We compare the models to a collection of data on local and high-redshift galaxies culled from the literature, and show that the correlation expected for gravity-driven turbulence is a better match to the observations than a feedback-driven model. This suggests that gravity is the ultimate source of ISM turbulence, at least in the rapidly-star-forming, high velocity dispersion galaxies for which our test is most effective. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the present data set, and the prospects for future measurements to enable a more definitive test of the two models.",1

These numerical integration schemes for differential equations on manifolds have been studied in a general and systematic manner since the 1990s and the activity has since then branched out in several different subareas, focussing both on theoretical and practical issues. From two alternative setups, using either frames or Lie group actions on a manifold, we here introduce the most important classes of schemes used to integrate nonlinear ordinary differential equations on Lie groups and manifolds. We describe a number of different applications where there is a natural action by a Lie group on a manifold such that our integrators can be implemented. An issue which is not well understood is the role of isotropy and how it affects the behaviour of the numerical methods. The order theory of numerical Lie group integrators has become an advanced subtopic in its own right, and here we give a brief introduction on a somewhat elementary level. Finally, we shall discuss Lie group integrators having the property that they preserve a symplectic structure or a first integral.",1

The susceptibility is decomposed into the orbital term, the spin term and also the spin-orbit cross term which is caused by the spin-orbit interaction. We show that the orbital susceptibility logarithmically diverges at the band touching energy in the point-node case, while it exhibits a stronger delta-function singularity in the line node case. The spin-orbit cross term is shown to be paramagnetic in the electron side while diamagnetic in the hole side, in contrast with other two terms which are both even functions in Fermi energy. The spin-orbit cross term in the nodal semimetal is found to be directly related to the chiral surface current induced by the topological surface modes.",1

It is a topologically non-trivial state and, as such, exhibits distinctive topological modes at surfaces and defects. In this paper we discuss the current theory and experimental results on chiral superconductors, focusing on two of the best-studied systems, Sr2RuO4, which is thought to be a chiral triplet p-wave superconductor, and UPt3, which has two low-temperature superconducting phases (in zero magnetic field), the lower of which is believed to be chiral triplet f-wave. Other systems that may exhibit chiral superconductivity are also discussed. Key signatures of chiral superconductivity are surface currents and chiral Majorana modes, Majorana states in vortex cores, and the possibility of half-flux quantum vortices in the case of triplet pairing. Experimental evidence for chiral superconductivity from muSR, NMR, strain, polar Kerr effect and Josephson tunneling experiments are discussed.",1

We find that the amplitude-flux relationship is visible over four orders of magnitude, in the range of fluxes from $10^{29}$ to $10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ \AA$^{-1}$, as a ""statistically perfect"" correlation with correlation coefficient 0.96 and p-value $ \sim 10^{-28}$. In the above range, the amplitude of variability for any of our 9 objects is proportional to the flux level with (almost) one and the same factor of proportionality for all 9 accreting white dwarfs with $\Delta F = 0.36 (\pm 0.05) F_{av}$, $\sigma_{rms} = 0.086(\pm 0.011) F_{av}$, and $\sigma_{rms} / \Delta F = 0.24 \pm 0.02$.

35795,0,"GPEC, a real-time capable Tokamak equilibrium code A new parallel equilibrium reconstruction code for tokamak plasmas is presented. GPEC allows to compute equilibrium flux distributions sufficiently accurate to derive parameters for plasma control within 1 ms of runtime which enables real-time applications at the ASDEX Upgrade experiment (AUG) and other machines with a control cycle of at least this size. The underlying algorithms are based on the well-established offline-analysis code CLISTE, following the classical concept of iteratively solving the Grad-Shafranov equation and feeding in diagnostic signals from the experiment. The new code adopts a hybrid parallelization scheme for computing the equilibrium flux distribution and extends the fast, shared-memory-parallel Poisson solver which we have described previously by a distributed computation of the individual Poisson problems corresponding to different basis functions. The code is based entirely on open-source software components and runs on standard server hardware and software environments. The real-time capability of GPEC is demonstrated by performing an offline-computation of a sequence of 1000 flux distributions which are taken from one second of operation of a typical AUG discharge and deriving the relevant control parameters with a time resolution of a millisecond. On current server hardware the new code allows employing a grid size of 32x64 zones for the spatial discretization and up to 15 basis functions. It takes into account about 90 diagnostic signals while using up to 4 equilibrium iterations and computing more than 20 plasma-control parameters, including the computationally expensive safety-factor q on at least 4 different levels of the normalized flux.",1

The various spectra were recorded (at 800 MHz proton frequency) on PD effluent samples obtained after 4 hour (intraperitoneal) dwell time from patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) and continuing normally on PD therapy. Inspite of devastating spectral feature of PD effluent due to the presence of intense resonances from glucose and lactate, we were able to identify about 53 small endogenous metabolites (including many complex coupled spin systems) and more than 90 % of the total CH cross peaks of 1H-13C HSQC spectrum were identified specific to various metabolites of PD effluent.

Here, we extend the notion of holonomy to families of quantum channels, i.e., trace preserving completely positive maps. By the use of the Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, we show that the proposed channel holonomy is related to the Uhlmann holonomy. The general theory is illustrated for specific examples. We put forward a physical realization of the channel holonomy in terms of interferometry. This enables us to identify a gauge invariant physical object that directly relates to the channel holonomy. Parallel transport condition and concomitant gauge structure are delineated in the case of smoothly parametrized families of channels. Finally, we point out that interferometer tests that have been carried out in the past to confirm the $4\pi$ rotation symmetry of the neutron spin, can be viewed as early experimental realizations of the channel holonomy.",1
35911,0,"Impenetrable Mass-Imbalanced Particles in One-Dimensional Harmonic Traps Strongly interacting particles in one dimension subject to external confinement have become a topic of considerable interest due to recent experimental advances and the development of new theoretical methods to attack such systems. In the case of equal mass fermions or bosons with two or more internal degrees of freedom, one can map the problem onto the well-known Heisenberg spin models. However, many interesting physical systems contain mixtures of particles with different masses. Therefore, a generalization of the recent strong-coupling techniques would be highly desirable. This is particularly important since such problems are generally considered non-integrable and thus the hugely successful Bethe ansatz approach cannot be applied. Here we discuss some initial steps towards this goal by investigating small ensembles of one-dimensional harmonically trapped particles where pairwise interactions are either vanishing or infinitely strong with focus on the mass-imbalanced case. We discuss a (semi)-analytical approach to describe systems using hyperspherical coordinates where the interaction is effectively decoupled from the trapping potential. As an illustrative example we analyze mass-imbalanced four-particle two-species mixtures with strong interactions between the two species. For such systems we calculate the energies, densities and pair-correlation functions.",1

While MEMS transducers sense or control physical, optical or chemical quantities, ICs typically provide functionalities related to the signals of these transducers, such as analog-to-digital conversion, amplification, filtering and information processing as well as communication between the MEMS transducer and the outside world. Thus, the vast majority of commercial MEMS products, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and micro-mirror arrays, are integrated and packaged together with ICs. There are a variety of possible methods of integrating and packaging MEMS and IC components, and the technology of choice strongly depends on the device, the field of application and the commercial requirements. In this review paper, traditional as well as innovative and emerging approaches to MEMS and IC integration are reviewed. These include approaches based on the hybrid integration of multiple chips (multi-chip solutions) as well as system-on-chip solutions based on wafer-level monolithic integration and heterogeneous integration techniques. These are important technological building blocks for the More-Than-Moore paradigm described in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.

For both a single-qubit and two-qubit systems, we find that the quantum coherence can not be protected from noise when the atom interacts with a non-boundary electromagnetic field.

Otherwise, the quantum coherence can only be protected in some degree in other polarizable direction.",1
36327,0,"FlatCam: Thin, Bare-Sensor Cameras using Coded Aperture and Computation FlatCam is a thin form-factor lensless camera that consists of a coded mask placed on top of a bare, conventional sensor array. Unlike a traditional, lens-based camera where an image of the scene is directly recorded on the sensor pixels, each pixel in FlatCam records a linear combination of light from multiple scene elements. A computational algorithm is then used to demultiplex the recorded measurements and reconstruct an image of the scene. FlatCam is an instance of a coded aperture imaging system; however, unlike the vast majority of related work, we place the coded mask extremely close to the image sensor that can enable a thin system.

Here we present a novel DCS approach based on a scanning Fabry-Perot micro-cavity resonator (SMART) providing a simple, compact and accurate method to resolve the mode structure of an optical frequency comb. The SMART approach, while drastically reducing system complexity, allows for a straightforward absolute calibration of the optical-frequency axis with an ultimate resolution limited by the micro-resonator resonance linewidth and can be used in any spectral region from XUV to THz. An application to high-precision spectroscopy of acetylene at 1.54 um is presented, demonstrating frequency resolution as low as 20 MHz with a single-scan optical bandwidth up to 1 THz in 20-ms measurement time and a noise-equivalent-absorption level per comb mode of 2.7 10^-9 cm^-1 Hz^(-1/2).

36657,0,"Super- and sub-Eddington accreting massive black holes: A comparison of slim and thin accretion discs through study of the spectral energy distribution We employ optical and UV observations to present SEDs for two reverberation-mapped samples of super-Eddington and sub-Eddington AGN with similar luminosity distributions. The samples are fitted with accretion disc models in order to look for SED differences that depend on the Eddington ratio. The fitting takes into account measured BH mass and accretion rates, BH spin and intrinsic reddening of the sources. All objects in both groups can be fitted by thin AD models over the range 0.2-1$\,\mu$m with reddening as a free parameter. The intrinsic reddening required to fit the data are relatively small, $E(B-V)\leq0.2$~mag, except for one source. Super-Eddington AGN seem to require more reddening. The distribution of $E(B-V)$ is similar to what is observed in larger AGN samples. The best fit disc models recover very well the BH mass and accretion for the two groups. However, the SEDs are very different, with super-Eddington sources requiring much more luminous far-UV continuum. The exact amount depends on the possible saturation of the UV radiation in slim discs. In particular, we derive for the super-Eddington sources a typical bolometric correction at 5100\AA{} of 60-150 compared with a median of $\sim$20 for the sub-Eddington AGN. The measured torus luminosity relative to $\lambda L_{\lambda}(5100\AA{}$) are similar in both groups. The $\alpha_{OX}$ distribution is similar too. However, we find extremely small torus covering factors for super-Eddington sources, an order of magnitude smaller than those of sub-Eddington AGN. The small differences between the groups regarding the spectral range 0.2-22$\,\mu$m, and the significant differences related to the part of the SED that we cannot observed may be consistent with some slim disc models. An alternative explanation is that present day slim-disc models over-estimate the far UV luminosity of such objects by a large amount.",1
36815,0,"Mutual distance dependence drives the observed jet power - radio luminosity scaling relations in radio galaxies The kinetic power of radio jets is a quantity of fundamental importance to studies of the AGN feedback process and radio galaxy physics. A widely used proxy for jet power is the extended radio luminosity. A number of empirical methods have been used to calibrate a scaling relationship between jet power (Q) and radio luminosity (L) of the form log(Q) = beta_L * log(L) + C. The regression slope has typically been found to be beta_L ~ 0.7 - 0.8. Here we show that the previously reported scaling relations are strongly affected by the confounding variable, distance. We find that in a sample of FRI X-ray cavity systems, after accounting for the mutual distance dependence, the jet power and radio luminosity are only weakly correlated, with slope beta_L ~ 0.3: significantly flatter than previously reported. We also find that in previously used samples of high-power sources, no evidence for an intrinsic correlation is present when the effect of distance is accounted for. Using a simple model we show that beta_L is expected to be significantly lower in samples of FRI radio galaxies than it is for FRIIs, due to the differing dynamics for these two classes of radio source. For FRI X-ray cavity systems the model predicts beta_L (FRI) ~ 0.5 in contrast to FRII radio galaxies, for which beta_L(FRII) ~ 0.8. We discuss the implications of our finding for studies of radio mode feedback, and radio galaxy physics.",1

36849,0,"Average-atom treatment of relaxation time in X-ray Thomson scattering from warm-dense matter The influence of finite relaxation times on Thomson scattering from warm-dense plasmas is examined within the framework of the average-atom approximation. Presently most calculations use the collision-free Lindhard dielectric function to evaluate the free-electron contribution to the Thomson cross section. In this work, we use the Mermin dielectric function, which includes relaxation time explicitly. The relaxation time is evaluated by treating the average atom as an impurity in a uniform electron gas and depends critically on the transport cross section. The calculated relaxation rates agree well with values inferred from the Ziman formula for the static conductivity and also with rates inferred from a fit to the frequency-dependent conductivity. Transport cross sections determined by the phase-shift analysis in the average-atom potential are compared with those evaluated in the commonly used Born approximation. The Born approximation converges to the exact cross sections at high energies; however, differences that occur at low energies lead to corresponding differences in relaxation rates. The relative importance of including relaxation time when modeling X-ray Thomson scattering spectra is examined by comparing calculations of the free-electron dynamic structure function for Thomson scattering using Lindhard and Mermin dielectric functions. Applications are given to warm-dense Be plasmas, with temperatures ranging from 2 to 32~eV and densities ranging from 2 to 64~g/cc.",1
36922,0,"The Extreme Ultraviolet Spectra of Low Redshift Radio Loud Quasars This paper reports on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum of three low redshift ($z \sim 0.6$) radio loud quasars, 3C 95, 3C 57 and PKS 0405-123. The spectra were obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) of the Hubble Space Telescope. The bolometric thermal emission, $L_{bol}$, associated with the accretion flow is a large fraction of the Eddington limit for all of these sources. We estimate the long term time averaged jet power, $\overline{Q}$, for the three sources. $\overline{Q}/L_{bol}$, is shown to lie along the correlation of $\overline{Q}/L_{bol}$ and $\alpha_{EUV}$ found in previous studies of the EUV continuum of intermediate and high redshift quasars, where the EUV continuum flux density between 1100 \AA\, and 700 \AA\, is defined by $F_{\nu} \sim \nu^{-\alpha_{EUV}}$. The high Eddington ratios of the three quasars extends the analysis into a wider parameter space. Selecting quasars with high Eddington ratios has accentuated the statistical significance of the partial correlation analysis of the data. Namely. the correlation of $\overline{Q}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ and $\alpha_{EUV}$ is fundamental and the correlation of $\overline{Q}$ and $\alpha_{EUV}$ is spurious at a very high statistical significance level (99.8\%). This supports the regulating role of ram pressure of the accretion flow in magnetically arrested accretion models of jet production. In the process of this study, we use multi-frequency and multi-resolution Very Large Array radio observations to determine that one of the bipolar jets in 3C 57 is likely frustrated by galactic gas that keeps the jet from propagating outside the host galaxy.",1

37182,0,"Discovery of Weyl semimetal state violating Lorentz invariance in MoTe2 A new type of Weyl semimetal state, in which the energy values of Weyl nodes are not the local extrema, has been theoretically proposed recently, namely type II Weyl semimetal. Distinguished from type I semimetal (e.g. TaAs), the Fermi surfaces in a type II Weyl semimetal consist of a pair of electron and hole pockets touching at the Weyl node. In addition, Weyl fermions in type II Weyl semimetals violate Lorentz invariance. Due to these qualitative differences distinct spectroscopy and magnetotransport properties are expected in type II Weyl semimetals. Here, we present the direct observation of the Fermi arc states in MoTe2 by using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Two arc states are identified for each pair of Weyl nodes whoes surface projections of them possess single topological charge, which is a unique property for type II Weyl semimetals. The experimentally determined Fermi arcs are consistent with our first principle calculations. Our results unambiguously establish that MoTe2 is a type II Weyl semimetal, which serves as a great test bed to investigate the phenomena of new type of Weyl fermions with Lorentz invariance violated.",1
37214,0,"Site-selective NMR for odd-frequency Cooper pairs around vortex in chiral p-wave superconductors In order to identify the pairing symmetry with chirality, we study site-selective NMR in chiral p-wave superconductors. We calculate local nuclear relaxation rate 1/T_1 in the vortex lattice state by Eilenberger theory, including the applied magnetic field dependence. We find that 1/T_1 in the NMR resonance line shape is different between two chiral states p_{pm}(=p_x{pm}ip_y), depending on whether the chirality is parallel or anti-parallel to the vorticity. Anomalous suppression of 1/T_1 occurs around the vortex core in the chiral p_- wave due to the negative coherence term coming from the odd-frequency s-wave Cooper pair induced around the vortex with Majorana state.",1
37284,0,"Curvature properties of some class of warped product manifolds Warped product manifolds with p-dimensional base, p=1,2, satisfy some curvature conditions of pseudosymmetry type. These conditions are formed from the metric tensor g, the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor R, the Ricci tensor S and the Weyl conformal curvature C of the considered manifolds. The main result of the paper states that if p=2 and the fibre is a semi-Riemannian space of constant curvature, if n is greater or equal to 4, then the (0,6)-tensors R.R - Q(S,R) and C.C of such warped products are proportional to the (0,6)-tensor Q(g,C) and the tensor C is expressed by a linear combination of some Kulkarni-Nomizu products formed from the tensors g and S. Thus these curvature conditions satisfy non-conformally flat non-Einstein warped product spacetimes (p=2, n=4). We also investigate curvature properties of pseudosymmetry type of quasi-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we obtain some curvature property of the Goedel spacetime.",1
37408,0,"Phases of one-dimensional SU(N) cold atomic Fermi gases --from molecular Luttinger liquids to topological phases Alkaline-earth and ytterbium cold atomic gases make it possible to simulate SU(N)-symmetric fermionic systems in a very controlled fashion. Such a high symmetry is expected to give rise to a variety of novel phenomena ranging from molecular Luttinger liquids to (symmetry- protected) topological phases. We review some of the phases that can be stabilized in a one dimensional lattice. The physics of this multicomponent Fermi gas turns out to be much richer and more exotic than in the standard SU(2) case. For N &gt; 2, the phase diagram is quite rich already in the case of the single-band model, including a molecular Luttinger liquid (with dominant superfluid instability in the N-particle channel) for incommensurate fillings, as well as various Mott-insulating phases occurring at commensurate fillings. Particular attention will be paid to the cases with additional orbital degree of freedom (which is accessible experimentally either by taking into account two atomic states or by putting atoms in the p-band levels). We introduce two microscopic models which are relevant for these cases and discuss their symmetries and strong coupling limits. More intriguing phase diagrams are then presented including, for instance, symmetry protected topological phases characterized by non-trivial edge states.",1

37567,0,"Resonantly Enhanced Multiphoton Ionization under XUV FEL radiation: A case study of the role of harmonics We provide a detailed quantitative study of the possible role of a small admixture of harmonics on resonant two-photon ionization. The motivation comes from the occasional presence of 2nd and 3rd harmonics in FEL radiation. We obtain the dependence of ionic yields on the intensity of the fundamental, the percentage of 2nd harmonic and the detuning of the fundamental from resonance. Having examined the cases of one and two intermediate resonances, we arrive at results of general validity and global behavior, showing that even a small amount of harmonic may seem deceptively innocuous.",1
37590,0,"Relaxation to equilibrium of generalized East processes on ${\mathbb{Z}}^d$: Renormalization group analysis and energy-entropy competition We consider a class of kinetically constrained interacting particle systems on ${\mathbb{Z}}^d$ which play a key role in several heuristic qualitative and quantitative approaches to describe the complex behavior of glassy dynamics. With rate one and independently among the vertices of ${\mathbb{Z}}^d$, to each occupation variable $\eta_x\in\{0,1\}$ a new value is proposed by tossing a $(1-q)$-coin. If a certain local constraint is satisfied by the current configuration the proposed move is accepted, otherwise it is rejected. For $d=1$, the constraint requires that there is a vacancy at the vertex to the left of the updating vertex. In this case, the process is the well-known East process. On ${\mathbb{Z}}^2$, the West or the South neighbor of the updating vertex must contain a vacancy, similarly, in higher dimensions. Despite of their apparent simplicity, in the limit $q\searrow0$ of low vacancy density, corresponding to a low temperature physical setting, these processes feature a rather complicated dynamic behavior with hierarchical relaxation time scales, heterogeneity and universality. Using renormalization group ideas, we first show that the relaxation time on ${\mathbb{Z}}^d$ scales as the $1/d$-root of the relaxation time of the East process, confirming indications coming from massive numerical simulations. Next, we compute the relaxation time in finite boxes by carefully analyzing the subtle energy-entropy competition, using a multiscale analysis, capacity methods and an algorithmic construction. Our results establish dynamic heterogeneity and a dramatic dependence on the boundary conditions. Finally, we prove a rather strong anisotropy property of these processes: the creation of a new vacancy at a vertex $x$ out of an isolated one at the origin (a seed) may occur on (logarithmically) different time scales which heavily depend not only on the $\ell_1$-norm of $x$ but also on its direction.",1
37717,0,"Catastrophic breakdown of the Caves model for quantum noise in some phase-insensitive linear amplifiers or attenuators based on atomic systems When considering the effect of quantum noise (QN) in a phase-insensitive linear amplifier or attenuator, it is customary to use the single channel Caves model (SC-CM). Although this model is valid in simple situations, such as the presence of a beam splitter, it is not necessarily valid when a system with many degrees of freedom is involved. In order to address this issue, we consider in this paper various atomic transitions corresponding to amplification or attenuation using the master-equation- (ME-) based approach to model the QN and to compare the results with the SC-CM. For a four-level system that consists of a transition producing a broad gain peak and a transition producing an absorption dip, which results in perfect transparency at the center, we observe a catastrophic breakdown of the SC-CM. We also show that for a general two-level atomic system, the SC-CM does not apply, except in the limiting case when only either amplification or attenuation exists. A special case where the two models predict the same result is a {\Lambda}-type three-level electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system in which the QN at zero detuning vanishes while the system is in the dark state. We also study an optically pumped five-level gain EIT system which has a perfect transparency dip superimposed on a gain profile, and yields the negative dispersion suitable for use in enhancing the sensitivity-bandwidth product of an interferometric gravitational wave detector. In this case, we find that, for some set of parameters, the QN is vanishingly small at the center of the dip, and the SC-CM agrees closely with the ME model. However, we also find that for some other set of parameters, the SC-SM model disagrees strongly with the ME model. All these cases illustrate a wide range of variations in the degree of disagreement between the predictions of the SC-CM and the ME approaches.",1
37768,0,"Diffusive heat blanketing envelopes of neutron stars We construct new models of outer heat blanketing envelopes of neutron stars composed of binary ion mixtures (H - He, He - C, C - Fe) in and out of diffusive equilibrium. To this aim, we generalize our previous work on diffusion of ions in isothermal gaseous or Coulomb liquid plasmas to handle non-isothermal systems. We calculate the relations between the effective surface temperature Ts and the temperature Tb at the bottom of heat blanketing envelopes (at a density rhob= 1e8 -- 1e10 g/cc) for diffusively equilibrated and non-equilibrated distributions of ion species at different masses DeltaM of lighter ions in the envelope. Our principal result is that the Ts - Tb relations are fairly insensitive to detailed distribution of ion fractions over the envelope (diffusively equilibrated or not) and depend almost solely on DeltaM. The obtained relations are approximated by analytic expressions which are convenient for modeling the evolution of neutron stars.",1

It is shown that in cold vacuum background the translational velocity of particle is independent of time and the intensity of its spontaneous emission is determined by the angular velocity and imaginary part of the polarizability.,1
37795,0,Design of a Low-Power 1.65 Gbps Data Channel for HDMI Transmitter This paper presents a design of low power data channel for application in High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) Transmitter circuit. The input is 10 bit parallel data and output is serial data at 1.65 Gbps. This circuit uses only a single frequency of serial clock input. All other timing signals are derived within the circuit from the serial clock. This design has dedicated lines to disable and enable all its channels within two pixel-clock periods only. A pair of disable and enable functions performed immediately after power-on of the circuit serves as the reset function. The presented design is immune to data-dependent switching spikes in supply current and pushes them in the range of serial frequency and its multiples. Thus filtering requirements are relaxed. The output stage uses a bias voltage of 2.8 volts for a receiver pull-up voltage of 3.3 volts. The reported data channel is designed using UMC 180 nm CMOS Technology. The design is modifiable for other inter-board serial interfaces like USB and LAN with different number of bits at the parallel input.,1

38008,0,"Numerical Continuation of Bound and Resonant States of the Two Channel Schr\""odinger Equation Resonant solutions of the quantum Schr\""odinger equation occur at complex energies where the S-matrix becomes singular. Knowledge of such resonances is important in the study of the underlying physical system. Often the Schr\""odinger equation is dependent on some parameter and one is interested in following the path of the resonances in the complex energy plane as the parameter changes. This is particularly true in coupled channel systems where the resonant behavior is highly dependent on the strength of the channel coupling, the energy separation of the channels and other factors. In previous work it was shown that numerical continuation, a technique familiar in the study of dynamical systems, can be brought to bear on the problem of following the resonance path in one dimensional problems and multi-channel problems without energy separation between the channels. A regularization can be defined that eliminates coalescing poles and zeros that appear in the S-matrix at the origin due to symmetries. Following the zeros of this regularized function then traces the resonance path. In this work we show that this approach can be extended to channels with energy separation, albeit limited to two channels. The issue here is that the energy separation introduces branch cuts in the complex energy domain that need to be eliminated with a so-called uniformization. We demonstrate that the resulting approach is suitable for investigating resonances in two-channel systems and provide an extensive example.",1
38036,0,"The KMOS Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS): The Tully-Fisher Relation at z ~ 1 We present the stellar mass ($M_{*}$), and K-corrected $K$-band absolute magnitude ($M_{K}$) Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs) for sub-samples of the 584 galaxies spatially resolved in H$\alpha$ emission by the KMOS Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS). We model the velocity field of each of the KROSS galaxies and extract a rotation velocity, $V_{80}$ at a radius equal to the major axis of an ellipse containing 80% of the total integrated H$\alpha$ flux. The large sample size of KROSS allowed us to select 210 galaxies with well measured rotation speeds. We extract from this sample a further 56 galaxies that are rotationally supported, using the stringent criterion $V_{80}/\sigma &gt; 3$, where $\sigma$ is the flux weighted average velocity dispersion. We find the $M_{K}$ and $M_{*}$ TFRs for this sub-sample to be $M_{K} / \rm{mag}= (-7.3 \pm 0.9) \times [(\log(V_{80}/\rm{km\ s^{-1}})-2.25]- 23.4 \pm 0.2$ , and $\log(M_{*} / M_{\odot})= (4.7 \pm 0.4) \times [(\log(V_{80}/\rm{km\ s^{-1}}) - 2.25] + 10.0 \pm 0.3$, respectively. We find an evolution of the $M_{*}$ TFR zero-point of $-0.41 \pm 0.08$ dex over the last $\sim $8 billion years. However, we measure no evolution in the $M_{K}$ TFR zero-point over the same period. We conclude that rotationally supported galaxies of a given dynamical mass had less stellar mass at $z \sim 1$ than the present day, yet emitted the same amounts of $K$-band light. The ability of KROSS to differentiate, using integral field spectroscopy with KMOS, between those galaxies that are rotationally supported and those that are not explains why our findings are at odds with previous studies without the same capabilities.",1
38138,0,"Particle-laden viscous channel flows - model regularization and parameter study We characterize the flow of a viscous suspension in an inclined channel where the flow is maintained in a steady state under the competing influences of gravity and an applied pressure drop. The basic model relies on a diffusive-flux formalism. Such models are common in the literature, yet many of them possess an unphysical singularity at the channel centreline where the shear rate vanishes. We therefore present a regularization of the basic diffusive-flux model that removes this singularity. This introduces an explicit (physical) dependence on the particle size into the model equations. This approach enables us to carry out a detailed parameter study showing in particular the opposing effects of the pressure drop and gravity. Conditions for counter-current flow and complete flow reversal are obtained from numerical solutions of the model equations. These are supplemented by an analytic lower bound on the ratio of the gravitational force to the applied pressure drop necessary to bring about complete flow reversal.",1

We compute and compare the disparate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained from different quantization prescriptions.

The geometric potential arising from an adiabatic expansion in terms of curvature is at best only valid for very small curvature.,1

To this end we use a recently developed formalism and validate first its performance by comparing its predictions to results obtained by solving the Liouville von Neumann master equation. The use of a Monte Carlo method in our formalism makes it possible to significantly increase the number of spins considered in the model system. We then analyse the dependence of the nuclear bulk polarization on the presence of nuclei in the vicinity of the electron and demonstrate that increasing the minimal distance between nuclei and electrons leads to a rise of the nuclear bulk polarization. These observations have implications for the design of radicals that can lead to impoved values of nuclear spin polarization. Furthermore, we discuss the potential to extend our formalism for more complex spin systems such as cross effect DNP.",1
38547,0,"Quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg half-odd integer spin model as the entanglement Hamiltonian of the integer spin Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states Applying a symmetric bulk bipartition to one-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki valence bond solid (VBS) states for the integer spin-S Haldane gapped phase, we can create an array of fractionalized spin-S/2 edge states with the super unit cell $l$ in the reduced bulk system, and the topological properties encoded in the VBS wave functions can be revealed. The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) with $l=even$ corresponds to the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-S/2 model. For the even integer spins, the EH still describes the Haldane gapped phase. For the odd integer spins, however, the EH just corresponds to the quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg half-odd integer spin model with spinon excitations, characterizing the critical point separating the topological Haldane phase from the trivial gapped phase. Our results thus demonstrate that the topological bulk property not only determines its fractionalized edge states, but also the quantum criticality associated with the topological phase, where the elementary excitations are precisely those fractionalized edge degrees of freedom confined in the bulk of the topological phase.",1
38560,0,"The physical and circuit-theoretic significance of the Memristor : Full version It is observed that the inductive and capacitive features of the memristor reflect (and are a quintessence of) such features of any resistor. The very presence of the voltage and current state variables, associated by their electrodynamics sense with electrical and magnetic fields, in the resistive characteristic v = f(i), forces any resister to accumulate some magnetic and electrostatic fields and energies around itself, i.e. L and C elements are always present. From the circuit-theoretic point of view, the role of the memristor is seen, first of all, in the elimination of the use of a unique v(i). This makes circuits with hysteresis characteristics relevant, and also suggests that the concept of memristor should influence the basic problem of definition of nonlinearity. Since the memristor mainly originates from the resistor, it was found necessary to overview some unusual cases of resistive circuits. The present opinion is that the framework of basic circuit theory and its connection with applications should be logically expanded in order to naturally include the new element.",1
38562,0,"Spectrum and Anisotropy of Turbulence from Multi-Frequency Measurement of Synchrotron Polarization We consider turbulent synchrotron emitting media that also exhibits Faraday rotation and provide a statistical description of synchrotron polarization fluctuations. In particular, we consider these fluctuations as a function of the spatial separation of the direction of measurements and as a function of wavelength for the same line-of-sight. On the basis of our general analytical approach, we introduce several measures that can be used to obtain the spectral slopes and correlation scales of both the underlying magnetic turbulence responsible for emission and the spectrum of the Faraday rotation fluctuations. We show the synergetic nature of these measures and discuss how the study can be performed using sparsely sampled interferometric data. We also discuss how additional characteristics of turbulence can be obtained, including the turbulence anisotropy, the three dimensional direction of the mean magnetic field. We consider both cases when the synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation regions coincide and when they are spatially separated. Appealing to our earlier study in Lazarian and Pogosyan (2012) we explain that our new results are applicable to a wide range of spectral indexes of relativistic electrons responsible for synchrotron emission. We expect wide application of our techniques both with existing synchrotron data sets as well as with big forthcoming data sets from LOFAR and SKA.",1
38588,0,"Large-scale flow generation by inhomogeneous helicity The effect of kinetic helicity (velocity--vorticity correlation) on turbulent momentum transport is investigated. The turbulent kinetic helicity (pseudoscalar) enters the Reynolds stress (mirrorsymmetric tensor) expression in the form of a helicity gradient as the coupling coefficient for the mean vorticity and/or the angular velocity (axial vector), which suggests the possibility of mean-flow generation in the presence of inhomogeneous helicity. This inhomogeneous helicity effect, which was previously confirmed at the level of a turbulence- or closure-model simulation, is examined with the aid of direct numerical simulations of rotating turbulence with non-uniform helicity sustained by an external forcing. The numerical simulations show that the spatial distribution of the Reynolds stress is in agreement with the helicity-related term coupled with the angular velocity, and that a large-scale flow is generated in the direction of angular velocity. Such a large-scale flow is not induced in the case of homogeneous turbulent helicity. This result confirms the validity of the inhomogeneous helicity effect in large-scale flow generation and suggests that a vortex dynamo is possible even in incompressible turbulence where there is no baroclinicity effect.",1
38720,0,"Can single-reference coupled cluster theory describe static correlation? While restricted single-reference coupled cluster theory truncated to singles and doubles (CCSD) provides very accurate results for weakly correlated systems, it usually fails in the presence of static or strong correlation. This failure is generally attributed to the qualitative breakdown of the reference, and can accordingly be corrected by using a multi-determinant reference, including higher-body cluster operators in the ansatz, or allowing symmetry breaking in the reference. None of these solutions are ideal; multi-reference coupled cluster is not black box, including higher-body cluster operators is computationally demanding, and allowing symmetry breaking leads to the loss of good quantum numbers. It has long been recognized that quasidegeneracies can instead be treated by modifying the coupled cluster ansatz. The recently introduced pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) approach is one such example which avoids catastrophic failures and accurately models strong correlations in a symmetry-adapted framework. Here we generalize pCCD to a singlet-paired coupled cluster model (CCD0) intermediate between coupled cluster doubles and pCCD, yielding a method that possesses the invariances of the former and much of the stability of the latter. Moreover, CCD0 retains the full structure of coupled cluster theory, including a fermionic wave function, antisymmetric cluster amplitudes, and well-defined response equations and density matrices.",1
38773,0,"Particle-hole symmetry, many-body localization, and topological edge modes We study the excited states of interacting fermions in one dimension with particle-hole symmetric disorder (equivalently, random-bond XXZ chains) using a combination of renormalization group methods and exact diagonalization. Absent interactions, the entire many-body spectrum exhibits infinite-randomness quantum critical behavior with highly degenerate excited states. We show that though interactions are an irrelevant perturbation in the ground state, they drastically affect the structure of excited states: even arbitrarily weak interactions split the degeneracies in favor of thermalization (weak disorder) or spontaneously broken particle-hole symmetry, driving the system into a many-body localized spin glass phase (strong disorder). In both cases, the quantum critical properties of the non-interacting model are destroyed, either by thermal decoherence or spontaneous symmetry breaking. This system then has the interesting and counterintuitive property that edges of the many-body spectrum are less localized than the center of the spectrum. We argue that our results rule out the existence of certain excited state symmetry-protected topological orders.",1

38827,0,"The spectral function of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model revisited: power laws and universality We reinvestigate the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model. In particular, we focus on the role of the momentum-dependence of the two-particle interaction V(q). Usually, V(q) is assumed to be a constant and integrals are regularized in the ultraviolet `by hand' employing an ad hoc procedure. As the momentum dependence of the interaction is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense this does not affect the universal low-energy properties of the model, e.g. exponents of power laws, if all energy scales are sent to zero. If, however, the momentum k is fixed away from the Fermi momentum k_F, with |k-k_F| setting a nonvanishing energy scale, the details of V(q) start to matter. We provide strong evidence that any curvature of the two-particle interaction at small transferred momentum q destroys power-law scaling of the momentum resolved spectral function as a function of energy. Even for |k-k_F| much smaller than the momentum space range of the interaction the spectral line shape depends on the details of V(q). The significance of our results for universality in the Luttinger liquid sense, for experiments on quasi one-dimensional metals, and for recent attempts to compute the spectral function of one-dimensional correlated systems taking effects of the curvature of the single-particle dispersion into account (nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology) is discussed.",1

39024,0,"Electrical stimulation of single-photon emission from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond with sub-superficial graphitic electrodes Focused MeV ion beams with micrometric resolution are suitable tools for the direct writing of conductive graphitic channels buried in an insulating diamond bulk. Their effectiveness has been shown for the fabrication of multi-electrode ionizing radiation detectors and cellular biosensors. In this work we investigate such fabrication method for the electrical excitation of color centers in diamond. Differently from optically-stimulated light emission from color centers in diamond, electroluminescence (EL) requires a high current flowing in the diamond subgap states between the electrodes. With this purpose, buried graphitic electrode pairs with a spacing of 10 $\mu$m were fabricated in the bulk of a single-crystal diamond sample using a 6 MeV C microbeam. The electrical characterization of the structure showed a significant current above an effective voltage threshold of 150V, which was interpreted according to the theory of Space Charge Limited Current. The EL imaging allowed to identify the electroluminescent regions and the residual vacancy distribution associated with the fabrication technique. Measurements evidenced bright electroluminescent emission from native neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy centers ($NV^0$); the acquired spectra highlighted the absence of EL associated with radiation damage.",1
39111,0,"A generalized quadratic estimate for random field nonstationarity In this paper, we attempt to shed light on a new class of nonstationary random fields which exhibit, what we call, local invariant nonstationarity. We argue that the local invariant property has a special interaction with a new generalized quadratic estimate---also derived here---which extends an estimate originally developed for gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background in Cosmology \cite{hu2001mapping, hu2002mass}. The nature of this interaction not only encourages low estimation bias but also enables accurate (and fast) quantification of Frequentist mean square error quantification of the estimated nonstationarity. These quadratic estimates are interesting, in their own right, as they detect and estimate nonstationarity by probing correlation among Fourier frequencies, the absence of which is the characterizing feature of weak stationarity (by Bochner's Theorem). Moreover, this generalized quadratic estimate can be computed with a Fourier characterization that runs in $\mathcal O(n\log n)$ time when observing the field on a uniform grid of size $n$ in $\Bbb R^d $. Finally, the work presented here partially addresses two other problems associated with the statistical theory of nonstationarity: 1) estimating the phase of a spatially varying modulated stationary random field and 2) identifying a larger class of nonstationary random fields which admit an extension of the quadratic estimator of gravitational lensing that extends the same attractive statistical properties.",1

Using spectroscopic and imaging observations of the afterglow and host of the long-duration Swift GRB121024A at z = 2.30, we give one of the most complete views of a GRB host/environment to date. We observe a strong damped Ly-alpha absorber (DLA) with a hydrogen column density of log N(HI) = 21.88 +/- 0.10, H2 absorption in the Lyman-Werner bands (molecular fraction of log(f)~ -1.4; fourth solid detection of molecular hydrogen in a GRB-DLA), the nebular emission lines H-alpha, H-beta, [O II], [O III] and [N II], as well as metal absorption lines. We find a GRB host galaxy that is highly star-forming (SFR ~ 40 solar masses/yr ), with a dust-corrected metallicity along the line of sight of [Zn/H]corr = -0.6 +/- 0.2 ([O/H] ~ -0.3 from emission lines), and a depletion factor [Zn/Fe] = 0.85 +/- 0.04. The molecular gas is separated by 400 km/s (and 1-3 kpc) from the gas that is photoexcited by the GRB. This implies a fairly massive host, in agreement with the derived stellar mass of log(M/M_solar ) = 9.9+/- 0.2. We dissect the host galaxy by characterising its molecular component, the excited gas, and the line-emitting star-forming regions. The extinction curve for the line of sight is found to be unusually flat (Rv ~15). We discuss the possibility of an anomalous grain size distributions.

This can be minimized by choosing suitable geographic locations or adaptive optical techniques, and avoided altogether by using orbital platforms outside the atmosphere. One of the promises of optical intensity interferometry is its independence from atmospherically induced phase fluctuations. By performing narrowband spectral filtering on sunlight and conducting temporal intensity interferometry using actively quenched avalanche photon detectors (APDs), the Solar $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ signature was directly measured. We observe an averaged photon bunching signal of $g^{(2)}(\tau) = 1.693 \pm 0.003$ from the Sun, consistently throughout the day despite fluctuating weather conditions, cloud cover and elevation angle. This demonstrates the robustness of the intensity interferometry technique against atmospheric turbulence and opto-mechanical instabilities, and the feasibility to implement measurement schemes with both large baselines and long integration times.",1
39485,0,"Evolution of Galaxy Shapes from Prolate to Oblate through Compaction Events We study the evolution of global shapes of galaxies using cosmological simulations. The shapes refer to the components of dark matter (DM), stars and gas at the stellar half-mass radius. Most galaxies undergo a characteristic compaction event into a blue nugget at $z\sim2-4$, which marks the transition from a DM-dominated central body to a self-gravitating baryonic core. We find that in the high-$z$, DM-dominated phase, the stellar and DM systems tend to be triaxial, preferentially prolate and mutually aligned. The elongation is supported by an anisotropic velocity dispersion that originates from the assembly of the galaxy along a dominant large-scale filament. We estimate that torques by the dominant halo are capable of inducing the elongation of the stellar system and its alignment with the halo. Then, in association with the transition to self-gravity, small-pericenter orbits puff up and the DM and stellar systems evolve into a more spherical and oblate configuration, aligned with the gas disc and associated with rotation. This transition typically occurs when the stellar mass is $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and the escape velocity in the core is $\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating that supernova feedback may be effective in keeping the core DM-dominated and the system prolate. The early elongated phase itself may be responsible for the compaction event, and the transition to the oblate phase may be associated with the subsequent quenching in the core.",1

The Laue lens is composed of bent crystals of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs, 220) and Germanium (Ge, 111), and, for the first time, the focusing property of bent crystals has been exploited for this field of applications. We show the preliminary results concerning the adhesive employed to fix the crystal tiles over the lens support, the positioning accuracy obtained and possible further improvements. The Laue lens petal that will be completed in a few months has a pass band of 80 - 300 keV and is a fraction of an entire Laue lens capable of focusing X-rays up to 600 keV, possibly extendable down to 20 - 30 keV with suitable low absorption crystal materials and focal length. The final goal is to develop a focusing optics that can improve the sensitivity over current telescopes in this energy band by 2 orders of magnitude.",1

For the analysis we use a newly computed neutron monitor yield function. The method consists of several consecutive steps: definition of the asymptotic viewing cones of neutron monitor stations considered for the data analysis by computations of cosmic ray particles propagation in a model magnetosphere with the MAGNETOCOSMICS code; computation of the neutron monitor model responses and derivation of the solar energetic particle characteristics on the basis of inverse problem solution. The pitch-angle distribution and rigidity spectrum of high-energy protons are obtained as function of time in the course of ground level enhancements. A comparison with previously reported results is performed and reasonable agreement is achieved. A discussion of the obtained results is included as well their possible application is included.",1
39821,0,"U(1) Emergence versus Chiral Symmetry Restoration in the Ashkin Teller Model We show that suppression of vortices in the Ashkin Teller ferromagnet on a square lattice splits the order-disorder transition and opens up an intermediate phase where the macroscopic symmetry enhances to U(1). When we selectively suppress the formation of non-chiral vortices, chiral vortices proliferate and replace the U(1) phase with a new phase where chiral symmetry is restored. This result demonstrates a fascinating phenomenon in which the symmetry information encoded in topological defects manifests itself in the symmetry of the phase where the defects proliferate. We also show that this phenomenon can occur in all $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ferromagnets with even values of $n$.",1
39842,0,"Luminosity Dependence and Redshift Evolution of Strong Emission-line Diagnostics in Star-Forming Galaxies We examine the redshift evolution of standard strong emission-line diagnostics for Hbeta-selected star-forming galaxies using the local SDSS sample and a new z = 0.2 - 2.3 sample obtained from HST WFC3 grism and Keck DEIMOS and MOSFIRE data. We use the SDSS galaxies to show that there is a systematic dependence of the strong emission-line properties on Balmer-line luminosity, which we interpret as showing that both the N/O abundance and the ionization parameter increase with increasing line luminosity. Allowing for the luminosity dependence tightens the diagnostic diagrams and the metallicity calibrations. The combined SDSS and high-redshift samples show that there is no redshift evolution in the line properties once the luminosity correction is applied, i.e., all galaxies with a given L(Hbeta) have similar strong emission-line distributions at all the observed redshifts. We argue that the best metal diagnostic for the high-redshift galaxies may be a luminosity-adjusted version of the [NII]6584/Halpha metallicity relation.",1
39852,0,"Two-particle asynchronous quantum correlation: wavefunction collapse acting as a beamsplitter A two-body quantum correlation is calculated for a particle reflecting from a moving mirror. Correlated interference results when the incident and reflected particle substates and their associated mirror substates overlap. Using the Copenhagen interpretation of measurement, an asynchronous joint probability density (PDF), which is a function both of the different positions and different times at which the particle and mirror are measured, is derived assuming that no interaction occurs between each measurement. Measurement of the particle first, in the correlated interference region, results in a splitting of the mirror substate into ones which have and have not reflected the particle. An analog of the interference from the Doppler effect for only measurements of the particle (a marginal PDF), in this two-body system, is shown to be a consequence of the asynchronous measurement. The simplification obtained for a microscopic particle reflecting from a mesoscopic or macroscopic mirror is used to illustrate asynchronous correlation interferometry. In this case, the small displacement between these mirror states can yield negligible environmental decoherence times. In addition, interference of these mirror states does not vanish in the limit of large mirror mass due to the small momentum exchange in reflecting a microscopic particle.",1

We quantified the vertical heating due to such impacts by measuring the disc thickness and squared vertical velocity dispersion $\sigma_{z}^{2}$ across the disc. According to our analysis the strength of heating is strongly dependent on the high mass end of the subhalo distribution from cosmological simulations.

39935,0,"Self-modulated laser wakefield accelerators as x-ray sources The development of a directional, small-divergence, and short-duration picosecond x-ray probe beam with an energy greater than 50 keV is desirable for high energy density science experiments. We therefore explore through particle-in-cell (PIC) computer simulations the possibility of using x-rays radiated by betatron-like motion of electrons from a self-modulated laser wakefield accelerator as a possible candidate to meet this need. Two OSIRIS 2D PIC simulations with mobile ions are presented, one with a normalized vector potential a0 = 1.5 and the other with an a0 = 3. We find that in both cases direct laser acceleration (DLA) is an important additional acceleration mechanism in addition to the longitudinal electric field of the plasma wave. Together these mechanisms produce electrons with a continuous energy spectrum with a maximum energy of 300 MeV for a0 = 3 case and 180 MeV in the a0 = 1.5 case. Forward-directed x-ray radiation with a photon energy up to 100 keV was calculated for the a0 = 3 case and up to 12 keV for the a0 = 1.5 case. The x-ray spectrum can be fitted with a sum of two synchrotron spectra with critical photon energy of 13 and 45 keV for the a0 of 3 and critical photon energy of 0.3 and 1.4 keV for a0 of 1.5 in the plane of polarization of the laser. The full width at half maximum divergence angle of the x-rays was 62 x 1.9 mrad for a0 = 3 and 77 x 3.8 mrad for a0 = 1.5.",1
39967,0,"Electron Acceleration at a Coronal Shock Propagating Through a Large-scale Streamer-like Magnetic Field With a test-particle simulation, we investigate the effect of large-scale coronal magnetic fields on electron acceleration at an outward-propagating coronal shock with a circular front. The coronal field is approximated by an analytical solution with a streamer-like magnetic field featured by partially open magnetic field and a current sheet at the equator atop the closed region. We show that the large-scale shock-field configuration, especially the relative curvature of the shock and the magnetic field line across which the shock is sweeping, plays an important role in the efficiency of electron acceleration. At low shock altitudes, when the shock curvature is larger than that of magnetic field lines, the electrons are mainly accelerated at the shock flanks; at higher altitudes, when the shock curvature is smaller, the electrons are mainly accelerated at the shock nose around the top of closed field lines. The above process reveals the shift of efficient electron acceleration region along the shock front during its propagation. It is also found that in general the electron acceleration at the shock flank is not so efficient as that at the top of closed field since at the top a collapsing magnetic trap can be formed. In addition, we find that the energy spectra of electrons is power-law like, first hardening then softening with the spectral index varying in a range of -3 to -6. Physical interpretations of the results and implications on the study of solar radio bursts are discussed.",1

This paper gives the Execution and some Additional Details for the Space Experiment Proposed for GRT, so that any of the Space research organizations (viz., NASA, ESA, ASI, ISRO, etc.) would conduct this low cost experiment, during Space missions to Mercury, Venus, or the sun, or may choose to conduct it as an independent space mission as the cost may be brought down by sending micro satellites using the launch sharing facility of any other lending country. Even an advanced country may conduct this experiment at low cost by sending a micro satellite (called a co-passenger satellite) by arranging with the Space research organization of any lending country, which is sending a primary satellite for a space mission to any of the desired locations.

40055,0,"Estimating the evolution of gas in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy from its star formation history: an illustrative example We propose that detailed data on the star formation history of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) may be used to estimate the evolution of the total mass M_g(t) for cold gas in its star-forming disk. Using Fornax as an illustrative example, we estimate its M_g(t) and the corresponding net gas flow rate Delta F(t) assuming a global star formation rate psi(t) = lambda_*(t)[M_g(t)/M_sun]^alpha consistent with observations of nearby galaxies. We identify the onset of the transition in Delta F(t) from a net inflow to a net outflow as the time t_sat at which the Fornax halo became a Milky Way satellite and estimate the evolution of its total mass M_h(t) at t &lt; t_sat using the median halo growth history in the LambdaCDM cosmology and its present mass within the half-light radius derived from observations. We examine three different cases of alpha = 1, 1.5, and 2, and justify the corresponding lambda_*(t) by comparing the gas mass fraction f_g(t) = M_g(t)/M_h(t) at t &lt; t_sat with results from simulations of gas accretion by halos in a reionized universe. We find that the Fornax halo grew to M_h(t_sat) ~ 2x10^9 M_sun at t_sat ~ 5 or 8 Gyr, in broad agreement with previous studies using data on its stellar kinematics and its orbital motion. We describe qualitatively the evolution of Fornax as a satellite and discuss potential extension of our approach to other dSphs.",1

Although deciding which pathways are most important is very helpful in for example determining which nuclear data would benefit from further refinement, pathways-reduced analysis need not necessarily define the most critical reaction, since one reaction may contribute to several different pathways. This work examines three different techniques for ranking reactions in their order of importance in determining the final inventory, comparing the pathways based metric (PBM), the direct method and one based on the Pearson correlation coefficient.

40494,0,"The effect of ambipolar electric fields on the electron heating in capacitive RF plasmas We investigate the electron heating dynamics in electropositive argon and helium capacitively coupled RF discharges driven at 13.56 MHz by Particle in Cell simulations and by an analytical model. The model allows to calculate the electric field outside the electrode sheaths, space and time resolved within the RF period. Electrons are found to be heated by strong ambipolar electric fields outside the sheath during the phase of sheath expansion in addition to classical sheath expansion heating. By tracing individual electrons we also show that ionization is primarily caused by electrons that collide with the expanding sheath edge multiple times during one phase of sheath expansion due to backscattering towards the sheath by collisions. A synergistic combination of these different heating events during one phase of sheath expansion is required to accelerate an electron to energies above the threshold for ionization. The ambipolar electric field outside the sheath is found to be time modulated due to a time modulation of the electron mean energy caused by the presence of sheath expansion heating only during one half of the RF period at a given electrode. This time modulation results in more electron heating than cooling inside the region of high electric field outside the sheath on time average. If an electric field reversal is present during sheath collapse, this time modulation and, thus, the asymmetry between the phases of sheath expansion and collapse will be enhanced. We propose that the ambipolar electron heating should be included in models describing electron heating in capacitive RF plasmas.",1
40745,0,"Anomalous Local Fermi Liquid in $f^{2}$-Singlet Configuration: Impurity Model for Heavy-Electron System UPt_3 It is shown by the Wilson numerical renormalization group method that a strongly correlated impurity with a crystalline-electric-field singlet ground state in the f^2-configuration exhibits an anomalous local Fermi liquid state in which the static magnetic susceptibility remains an uncorrelated value while the NMR relaxation rate is enhanced in proportion to the square of the mass enhancement factor. Namely, the Korringa-Shiba relation is apparently broken. This feature closely matches the anomalous behaviors observed in UPt_3, i.e., the coexistence of an unenhanced value of the Knight shift due to quasiparticles contribution (the decrease across the superconducting transition) and the enhanced relaxation rate of NMR. Such an anomalous Fermi liquid behavior suggests that the Fermi liquid corrections for the susceptibility are highly anisotropic.",1
40845,0,"Treatment of PDMS surfaces using pulsed DBD plasmas: comparing the use of different gases and its influence on adhesion In this work we present some results of the treatment of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces using pulsed dielectric barrier discharge plasmas. The results of plasma treatment using different gases and mixtures, argon, argon plus water vapor, helium, helium plus water vapor, nitrogen and nitrogen plus water vapor, were compared testing the adhesion between two PDMS samples for each kind of plasma. We also studied the water contact angle in function of plasma process time of PDMS surfaces with each kind of plasma treatment. The plasma was characterized by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) to identify the emitting species and determine the plasma temperatures. The plasma temperature for each process was estimated comparing the spectrum obtained by OES with the spectrum generated by SpecAir simulation code. Measurements of power delivered to the plasmas were also performed. As the results, all the process using different gases show good adhesion efficacy between PDMS samples when long exposure time (larger than 150 seconds) is applied. However, when only a few discharges are applied to PDMS samples the helium plasma process presented best results. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis of PDMS samples treated with helium plasma showed reduction in the surface roughness, which increase the surface contact area and improves the adhesion.",1
40889,0,"Detecting monopole charge in Weyl semimetals via quantum interference transport Topological Weyl semimetals can host Weyl nodes with monopole charges in momentum space. How to detect the signature of the monopole charges in quantum transport remains a challenging topic. Here, we reveal the connection between the parity of monopole charge in topological semimetals and the quantum interference corrections to the conductivity. We show that the parity of monopole charge determines the sign of the quantum interference correction, with odd and even parity yielding the weak anti-localization and weak localization effects, respectively. This is attributed to the Berry phase difference between time-reversed trajectories circulating the Fermi sphere that encloses the monopole charges. From standard Feynman diagram calculations, we further show that the weak-field magnetoconductivity at low temperatures is proportional to $+\sqrt{B}$ in double-Weyl semimetals and $-\sqrt{B}$ in Weyl semimetals, respectively, which could be verified experimentally.",1

The system simplicity and wideband wavelength tunability combined with the ability to control the temporal characteristics of the gain-switched pulses mean this is a versatile source highly suited to a wide range of applications in the eye-safe region of the infrared, including spectroscopy, sensing and material processing, as well as being a practical seed source for pumping nonlinear processes.",1
40919,0,"The 154 MHz radio sky observed by the Murchison Widefield Array: noise, confusion and first source count analyses We analyse a 154 MHz image made from a 12 h observation with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to determine the noise contribution and behaviour of the source counts down to 30 mJy. The MWA image has a bandwidth of 30.72 MHz, a field-of-view within the half-power contour of the primary beam of 570 deg^2, a resolution of 2.3 arcmin and contains 13,458 sources above 5 sigma. The rms noise in the centre of the image is 4-5 mJy/beam. The MWA counts are in excellent agreement with counts from other instruments and are the most precise ever derived in the flux density range 30-200 mJy due to the sky area covered. Using the deepest available source count data, we find that the MWA image is affected by sidelobe confusion noise at the ~3.5 mJy/beam level, due to incompletely-peeled and out-of-image sources, and classical confusion becomes apparent at ~1.7 mJy/beam. This work highlights that (i) further improvements in ionospheric calibration and deconvolution imaging techniques would be required to probe to the classical confusion limit and (ii) the shape of low-frequency source counts, including any flattening towards lower flux densities, must be determined from deeper ~150 MHz surveys as it cannot be directly inferred from higher frequency data.",1
41018,0,"Evidence for broken Galilean invariance at the quantum spin Hall edge We study transport properties of the helical edge channels of a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator, in the presence of electron-electron interactions and weak, local Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The combination of the two allows for inelastic backscattering that does not break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), resulting in interaction-dependent power law corrections to the conductance. Here, we use a non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism to describe the situation of a long, one-dimensional edge channel coupled to external reservoirs, where the applied bias is the leading energy scale. By calculating explicitly the corrections to the conductance up to fourth order of the impurity strength, we analyse correlated single- and two-particle backscattering processes on a microscopic level. Interestingly, we show that the modeling of the leads together with the breaking of Galilean invariance has important consequences on the transport properties. Such breaking occurs, because the Galilean invariance of the bulk spectrum transforms into an emergent Lorentz invariance of the edge spectrum. With this broken Galilean invariance at the QSH edge, we find a contribution to single particle backscattering with a very low power scaling, while in the presence of Galilean invariance the leading contribution would be due to correlated two-particle backscattering only. This difference is further reflected in different values of the Fano factor of the shot noise, an experimentally observable quantity. The described behaviour is specific to the Rashba scatterer, and does not occur in the case of backscattering off a time-reversal breaking, magnetic impurity.",1
41029,0,"Object Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of Radiation Damage in Neutron-Irradiated Tungsten Part-I: Neutron Flux with a PKA Spectrum Corresponding to the High-flux Isotope Reactor Object kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed to study the impact of varying dose rate and grain size up to a dose of 1.0 dpa in pure, polycrystalline tungsten, subjected to a neutron irradiation having a PKA spectrum corresponding to the High Flux Isotope Reactor. The present study models defect cluster accumulation in tungsten, but does not consider the impact of transmutation or pre-existing defects beyond the grain boundary sinks, with varying grain size. With increasing dose rate, the vacancy cluster density increases, while the number density of vacancies decreases. Accordingly, the average vacancy cluster size and the fraction of vacancies that are part of visible clusters decreases with increasing dose rate. With increasing grain size, both the number densities of vacancies and vacancy clusters decrease, while both the fraction of vacancies in visible clusters and the average vacancy cluster size increase. This is caused by the pseudo-ripening of the vacancy clusters due to the longer-lived self-interstitial clusters in larger grains. The spatial ordering of vacancy clusters along {110} planes was observed for both grain sizes and all dose rates studied. Interplanar spacing increases with grain size; however, no clear dependence on dose or dose rate was observed. The results of this study show that 1D diffusion of self-interstitial clusters, while necessary, is not sufficient to form a void lattice, and that the diffusion of vacancies is also required. A methodology is suggested for choosing the simulation box dimensions so as to represent more faithfully the effects of one-dimensional migrating self-interstitial-atom clusters.",1
41054,0,"Sick, the spectroscopic inference crank There exists an inordinate amount of spectral data in both public and private astronomical archives which remain severely under-utilised. The lack of reliable open-source tools for analysing large volumes of spectra contributes to this situation, which is poised to worsen as large surveys successively release orders of magnitude more spectra. In this Article I introduce sick, the spectroscopic inference crank, a flexible and fast Bayesian tool for inferring astrophysical parameters from spectra. sick can be used to provide a nearest-neighbour estimate of model parameters, a numerically optimised point estimate, or full Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior probability distributions. This generality empowers any astronomer to capitalise on the plethora of published synthetic and observed spectra, and make precise inferences for a host of astrophysical (and nuisance) quantities. Model intensities can be reliably approximated from existing grids of synthetic or observed spectra using linear multi-dimensional interpolation, or a Cannon-based model. Additional phenomena that transform the data (e.g., redshift, rotational broadening, continuum, spectral resolution) are incorporated as free parameters and can be marginalised away. Outlier pixels (e.g., cosmic rays or poorly modelled regimes) can be treated with a Gaussian mixture model, and a noise model is included to account for systematically underestimated variance. Combining these phenomena into a scalar-justified, quantitative model permits precise inferences with credible uncertainties on noisy data. Using a forward model on low-resolution, high S/N spectra of M67 stars reveals atomic diffusion processes on the order of 0.05 dex, previously only measurable with differential analysis techniques in high-resolution spectra.

41247,0,"Entanglement properties of correlated random spin chains and similarities with conformal invariant systems We study the R\'enyi entanglement entropy and the Shannon mutual information for a class of spin-1/2 quantum critical XXZ chains with random coupling constants which are partially correlated. In the XX case, distinctly from the usual uncorrelated random case where the system is governed by an infinite-disorder fixed point, the correlated-disorder chain is governed by finite-disorder fixed points. Surprisingly, we verify that, although the system is not conformally invariant, the leading behavior of the R\'enyi entanglement entropies are similar to those of the clean (no randomness) conformally invariant system. In addition, we compute the Shannon mutual information among subsystems of our correlated-disorder quantum chain and verify the same leading behavior as the $n=2$ R\'enyi entanglement entropy. This result extends a recent conjecture concerning the same universal behavior of these quantities for conformally invariant quantum chains. For the generic spin-1/2 quantum critical XXZ case, the true asymptotic regime is identical to that in the uncorrelated disorder case. However, these finite-disorder fixed points govern the low-energy physics up to a very long crossover length scale and the same results as in the XX case apply. Our results are based on exact numerical calculations and on a numerical strong-disorder renormalization group.",1
41264,0,"Two bi-stability jumps in theoretical wind models for massive stars and the implications for Luminous Blue Variable supernovae Luminous Blue Variables have been suggested to be the direct progenitors of supernova types IIb and IIn, with enhanced mass loss prior to explosion. However, the mechanism of this mass loss is not yet known. Here, we investigate the qualitative behaviour of theoretical stellar wind mass-loss as a function of Teff across two bi-stability jumps in blue supergiant regime and also in proximity to the Eddington limit, relevant for LBVs. To investigate the physical ingredients that play a role in the radiative acceleration we calculate blue supergiant wind models with the CMFGEN non-LTE model atmosphere code over an effective temperature range between 30000 and 8800 K. Although our aim is not to provide new mass-loss rates for BA supergiants, we study and confirm the existence of two bi-stability jumps in mass-loss rates predicted by Vink, de Koter, &amp; Lamers (1999). However, they are found to occur at somewhat lower Teff (20000 and 9000 K, respectively) than found previously, which would imply that stars may evolve towards lower Teff before strong mass-loss is induced by the bi-stability jumps. When the combined effects of the second bi-stability jump and the proximity to Eddington limit are accounted for, we find a dramatic increase in the mass-loss rate by up to a factor of 30. Further investigation of both bi-stability jumps is expected to lead to a better understanding of discrepancies between empirical modelling and theoretical mass-loss rates reported in the literature, and to provide key inputs for the evolution of both normal AB supergiants and LBVs, as well as their subsequent supernova type II explosions.",1

41350,0,"Multispectral imaging using a single bucket detector Current multispectral imagers suffer from low photon efficiency and limited spectrum range. These limitations are partially due to the technological limitations from array sensors (CCD or CMOS), and also caused by separative measurement of the entries/slices of a spatial-spectral data cube. Besides, they are mostly expensive and bulky. To address above issues, this paper proposes to image the 3D multispectral data with a single bucket detector in a multiplexing way. Under the single pixel imaging scheme, we project spatial-spectral modulated illumination onto the target scene to encode the scene's 3D information into a 1D measurement sequence. Conventional spatial modulation is used to resolve the scene's spatial information. To avoid increasing requisite acquisition time for 2D to 3D extension of the latent data, we conduct spectral modulation in a frequency-division multiplexing manner in the speed gap between slow spatial light modulation and fast detector response. Then the sequential reconstruction falls into a simple Fourier decomposition and standard compressive sensing problem. A proof-of-concept setup is built to capture the multispectral data (64 pixels $\times$ 64 pixels $\times$ 10 wavelength bands) in the visible wavelength range (450nm-650nm) with acquisition time being 1 minute.

41399,0,"The SLUGGS Survey: The Assembly Histories of Individual Early-type Galaxies Early-type (E and S0) galaxies may have assembled via a variety of different evolutionary pathways. Here we investigate these pathways by comparing the stellar kinematic properties of 24 early-type galaxies from the SLUGGS survey with the hydrodynamical simulations of Naab et al. (2014). In particular, we use the kinematics of starlight up to 4 effective radii (R$_e$) as diagnostics of galaxy inner and outer regions, and assign each galaxy to one of six Naab et al. assembly classes. The majority of our galaxies (14/24) have kinematic characteristics that indicate an assembly history dominated by gradual gas dissipation and accretion of many gas-rich minor mergers. Three galaxies, all S0s, indicate that they have experienced gas-rich major mergers in their more recent past. One additional elliptical galaxy is tentatively associated with a gas-rich merger which results in a remnant galaxy with low angular momentum. Pathways dominated by gas-poor (major or minor) mergers dominate the mass growth of six galaxies. Most SLUGGS galaxies appear to have grown in mass (and size) via the accretion of stars and gas from minor mergers, with late major mergers playing a much smaller role. We find that the fraction of accreted stars correlates with the stellar mean age and metallicity gradient, but not with the slope of the total mass density profile. We briefly mention future observational and modelling approaches that will enhance our ability to accurately reconstruct the assembly histories of individual present day galaxies.",1
41400,0,"Role of spatial averaging in multicellular gradient sensing Gradient sensing underlies important biological processes including morphogenesis, polarization, and cell migration. The precision of gradient sensing increases with the length of a detector (a cell or group of cells) in the gradient direction, since a longer detector spans a larger range of concentration values. Intuition from analyses of concentration sensing suggests that precision should also increase with detector length in the direction transverse to the gradient, since then spatial averaging should reduce the noise. However, here we show that, unlike for concentration sensing, the precision of gradient sensing decreases with transverse length for the simplest gradient sensing model, local excitation--global inhibition (LEGI). The reason is that gradient sensing ultimately relies on a subtraction of measured concentration values. While spatial averaging indeed reduces the noise in these measurements, which increases precision, it also reduces the covariance between the measurements, which results in the net decrease in precision. We demonstrate how a recently introduced gradient sensing mechanism, regional excitation--global inhibition (REGI), overcomes this effect and recovers the benefit of transverse averaging. Using a REGI-based model, we compute the optimal two- and three-dimensional detector shapes, and argue that they are consistent with the shapes of naturally occurring gradient-sensing cell populations.",1
41420,0,"The probability distribution functions of emission line flux measurements and their ratios Many physical parameters in astrophysics are derived using the ratios of two observed quantities. If the relative uncertainties on measurements are small enough, uncertainties can be propagated analytically using simplifying assumptions, but for large normally distributed uncertainties, the probability distribution of the ratio become skewed, with a modal value offset from that expected in Gaussian uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, the most likely value of a ratio A/B is not equal to the reciprocal of the most likely value of B/A. The effect is most pronounced when the uncertainty on the denominator is larger than that on the numerator. We show that this effect is seen in an analysis of 12,126 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The intrinsically fixed ratio of the [O III] lines at 4959 and 5007 ${\AA}$ is conventionally expressed as the ratio of the stronger line to the weaker line. Thus, the uncertainty on the denominator is larger, and non-Gaussian probability distributions result. By taking this effect into account, we derive an improved estimate of the intrinsic 5007/4959 ratio. We obtain a value of 3.012 $\pm$ 0.008, which is slightly but statistically significantly higher than the theoretical value of 2.98. We further investigate the suggestion that fluxes measured from emission lines at low signal to noise are strongly biased upwards. We were unable to detect this effect in the SDSS line flux measurements, and we could not reproduce the results of Rola and Pelat who first described this bias. We suggest that the magnitude of this effect may depend strongly on the specific fitting algorithm used.",1

We show that thermal emission is very different whether the aperture size is large or small compared to the thermal wavelength. Subwavelength apertures filled with vacuum (subwavelength blackbody) have their thermal emission strongly decreased compared to classical blackbodies. A simple expression of their emissivity can be calculated and their total emittance scales as T 8 instead of T 4 for large apertures. Thermal emission of disk of materials with a size comparable to the wavelength is also discussed. It is shown in particular that emissivity of such a disk is increased when the material can support surface waves such as phonon polaritons.",1
41752,0,"Effect of strain and temperature on the threshold displacement energy in body-centered cubic iron The threshold displacement energy (TDE) is the minimum amount of kinetic energy required to displace an atom from its lattice site. The magnitude of the TDE displays significant variance as a function of the crystallographic direction, system temperature and applied strain, among a variety of other factors. It is critically important to determine an accurate value of the TDE in order to calculate the total number of displacements due to a given irradiation condition, and thus to understand the materials response to irradiation. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to calculate the threshold displacement energy in body-centered cubic iron as a function of strain and temperature. With applied strain, a decrease of the TDE of up to approximately 14 eV was observed. A temperature increase from 300 K to 500 K can result in an increase of the TDE of up to approximately 9 eV.",1

41963,0,"A Cost-Effective Strategy for Storing Scientific Datasets with Multiple Service Providers in the Cloud Cloud computing provides scientists a platform that can deploy computation and data intensive applications without infrastructure investment. With excessive cloud resources and a decision support system, large generated data sets can be flexibly 1 stored locally in the current cloud, 2 deleted and regenerated whenever reused or 3 transferred to cheaper cloud service for storage. However, due to the pay for use model, the total application cost largely depends on the usage of computation, storage and bandwidth resources, hence cutting the cost of cloud based data storage becomes a big concern for deploying scientific applications in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy that can cost effectively store large generated data sets with multiple cloud service providers. The strategy is based on a novel algorithm that finds the trade off among computation, storage and bandwidth costs in the cloud, which are three key factors for the cost of data storage. Both general (random) simulations conducted with popular cloud service providers pricing models and three specific case studies on real world scientific applications show that the proposed storage strategy is highly cost effective and practical for run time utilization in the cloud.",1

42371,0,"The Distance-Decay Function of Geographical Gravity Model: Power Law or Exponential Law? The distance-decay function of the geographical gravity model is originally an inverse power law, which suggests a scaling process in spatial interaction. However, the distance exponent of the model cannot be explained with the ideas from Euclidean geometry. This results in what is called dimension dilemma. In particular, the gravity model based on power law could not be derived from general principles by traditional ways. Consequently, a negative exponential function substituted for the inverse power function to serve for a distance-decay function for the gravity model. However, the exponential-based gravity model goes against the first law of geography. This paper is devoted to solve these kinds of problems by mathematical reasoning and empirical analysis. First, it can be proved that the distance exponent of the gravity model is essentially a fractal dimension. Thus the dimensional dilemma of the power-based gravity model can be resolved using the concepts from fractal geometry. Second, the exponential function indicates locality and localization, which violates the basic principle of spatial interaction. The power function implies action at a distance, which is the necessary condition of geographical gravitation. Third, the gravity model based on power law decay can be derived from the entropy- maximizing principle by introducing a proper postulate. The observational data of China's cities and regions are employed to verify the theoretical inferences, and the results support power-law distance decay. A conclusion can be reached that the preferred form of geographical gravity model is its original form, which is based on an inverse power law rather than a negative exponential law.",1

The model has two inputs: the rotational speed and the electric load signal. A homogeneous anisotropic bulk model for the coils allows computing the current distribution in the coils. From this distribution, the hysteretic losses are estimated. Beyond the interest on providing an estimate on the global energy dissipation in the machine, in this work we present a more detailed local analysis that allows addressing issues such as coil design, critical current ratting, electric load change rate limits, cryocooler design, identification of quench-prone regions and overall transient performance.",1
42580,0,"The SINFONI Black Hole Survey: The Black Hole Fundamental Plane revisited and the paths of (co-) evolution of supermassive black holes and bulges We investigate the correlations between the black hole mass $M_{BH}$, the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, the bulge mass $M_{Bu}$, the bulge average spherical density $\rho_h$ and its spherical half mass radius $r_h$, constructing a database of 97 galaxies (31 core ellipticals, 17 power-law ellipticals, 30 classical bulges, 19 pseudo bulges) by joining 72 galaxies from the literature to 25 galaxies observed during our recent SINFONI black hole survey. For the first time we discuss the full error covariance matrix. We analyse the well known $M_{BH}-\sigma$ and $M_{BH}-M_{Bu}$ relations and establish the existence of statistically significant correlations between $M_{Bu}$ and $r_h$ and anti-correlations between $M_{Bu}$ and $\rho_h$. We establish five significant bivariate correlations ($M_{BH}-\sigma-\rho_h$, $M_{BH}-\sigma-r_h$, $M_{BH}-M_{Bu}-\sigma$, $M_{BH}-M_{Bu}-\rho_h$, $M_{BH}-M_{Bu}-r_h$) that predict $M_{BH}$ of 77 core and power-law ellipticals and classical bulges with measured and intrinsic scatter as small as $\approx 0.36$ dex and $\approx 0.33$ dex respectively, or 0.26 dex when the subsample of 45 galaxies defined by Kormendy and Ho (2013) is considered. In contrast, pseudo bulges have systematically lower $M_{BH}$, but approach the predictions of all the above relations at spherical densities $\rho_h\ge 10^{10} M_\odot/kpc^3$ or scale lengths $r_h\le 1$ kpc. These findings fit in a scenario of co-evolution of BH and classical-bulge masses, where core ellipticals are the product of dry mergers of power-law bulges and power-law Es and bulges the result of (early) gas-rich mergers and of disk galaxies. In contrast, the (secular) growth of BHs is decoupled from the growth of their pseudo bulge hosts, except when (gas) densities are high enough to trigger the feedback mechanism responsible for the existence of the correlations between $M_{BH}$ and galaxy structural parameters.",1

42888,0,"The Mathematical Basics and the Results of the Theory of physical structures The theory of Physical Structures (TPS) was put forward by Professor Yu.I. Kulakov for the sake of classifying the laws of Physics. The history of the development of that theory is given in his monograph [1]. A physical structure is a geometry of one or two sets whose metric function assigns a number to every pair of points. Its phenomenological symmetry, under Kulakov, means that for every collection of some finite number of points all of their reciprocal distances are functionally related. Such geometries are endowed with a group symmetry under Klein, which is equivalent to the phenomenological symmetry, and many of them have an essential physical interpretation. That is why they are to be defined precisely and explored as purely mathematical objects. In this monograph we treat the mathematical basics of the TPS and present the results of attempts at classification that have been obtained by now. We hope that the monograph will be of interest for research workers and teachers, senior and post graduate students, as well as to all those interested in algebra, geometry and theoretical physics who would like to use the TPS in their research projects or could want to contribute to the development of its mathematical apparatus.",1
42937,0,"Investigations on the energy balance in TDCB tests The TDCB test is an established method to determine the critical strain energy release rate of adhesives in mode I. Provided that the adherends stay elastic, that the adhesive layer is not too flexible and that inertia effects can be neglected, the experiment allows to identify the work required by the adhesive layer per area of crack growth. The evaluation according to the standard does not permit to distinguish between different sources of dissipation in the adhesive layer or at the adhesive-adherend interfaces, though. This paper proposes two approaches to gain a more detailed understanding of the dissipation in mode I crack growth of adhesive layers. The first investigation method uses detailed finite element simulations of the TDCB test based on an elastic-plastic adhesive material model derived from tests on bulk specimens. The simulation is used to distinct between the work required for the plastic deformation of the entire adhesive layer and the work consumed by the crack and the adhesive in its vicinity. The dependence of this distribution of work on the adhesive layer thickness is studied. The second approach adds a temperature measurement by an infrared camera to the TDCB test. This measurement allows observation of the thermo-elastic effect in the adhesive layer and of the heat generation at the crack. Finally, the results of the two approaches are employed to estimate the energy balance in the TDCB test.",1

Accurate DR data is sparse while complete DR coverage is unsophisticated (e.g. average-atom or Burgess General Formula) as illustrated by the large uncertainties which currently exist in the tungsten ionization balance. To this end, we present a series of partial final state-resolved and total DR rate coefficients for W73+ to W56+ Tungsten ions. This is part of a wider effort within The Tungsten Project to calculate accurate dielectronic recombination rate coefficients for the tungsten isonuclear sequence for use in collisional-radiative modelling of finite-density tokamak plasmas. The recombination rate coefficients have been calculated with autostructure using kappa-averaged relativistic wavefunctions in level resolution (intermediate coupling) and configuration resolution (configuration average). The results are available from OPEN-ADAS according to the adf09 and adf48 standard formats. Comparison with previous calculations of total DR rate coefficients for W63+ and W56+ yield agreement to within 20% and 10%, respectively, at peak temperature.

43240,0,"On plane-wave relativistic electrodynamics in plasmas and in vacuum We revisit the exact microscopic equations (in differential, and equivalent integral form) ruling a relativistic cold plasma after the plane-wave Ansatz, without customary approximations. We show that in the Eulerian description the motion of a very diluted plasma initially at rest and excited by an arbitrary transverse plane electromagnetic travelling-wave has a very simple and explicit dependence on the transverse electromagnetic potential; for a non-zero density plasma the above motion is a good approximation of the real one as long as the back-reaction of the charges on the electromagnetic field can be neglected, i.e. for a time lapse decreasing with the plasma density, and can be used as initial step in an iterative resolution scheme. As one of many possible applications, we use these results to describe how the ponderomotive force of a very intense and short plane laser pulse hitting normally the surface of a plasma boosts the surface electrons into the ion background. Because of this penetration the electrons are then pulled back by the electric force exerted by the ions and may leave the plasma with high energy in the direction opposite to that of propagation of the pulse [G.

When $Q$ is invariant under a torsion free connection, $Z(Q) $ can be provided with an almost complex structure $ \mathbb J $. In the case $ n = 1 $ Atiyah, Hitchin and Singer have related the integrability of $ \mathbb J $ to the geometry of $ (M, Q) $. For $ n&gt; 1 $ Salamon showed that the almost complex structure $ \mathbb J $ on $ Z (Q) $ is always integrable. The purpose of this article is to extend these results to the generalized complex geometry. We begin by defining the concept of almost generalized quaternionic manifolds $ (M, g, \mathcal Q ) $. We will see that we can associate a twistor space denoted by $ \mathcal Z( \mathcal Q) $ which is a $ \mathbb S^2$-bundle over $ M $. When $\mathcal Q$ is invariant under a generalized torsion free connection, then $ \mathcal Z(\mathcal Q) $ comes with an almost generalized complex structure $\mathbb J$. Whatever the dimension of $ M $ is, we give a criterion for integrability of the almost generalized complex structure $ \mathbb J $ on $ \mathcal Z(\mathcal Q) $. In the particular case where $ (M, g,\mathcal Q) $ is a generalized quaternionic K\""ahler manifold, we show that $\mathbb J$ is always integrable as soon as $n&gt;1$.

Using classical Monte Carlo simulations and analytical tools we investigate the S-K model on the n-sheets booklet. This is obtained by gluing together n independent copies of the model, and it is the main ingredient to construct the Renyi entanglement-related quantities. We find a glassy phase at low temperature, whereas at high temperature the model exhibits paramagnetic behavior, consistent with the regular S-K model. The temperature of the paramagnetic-glassy transition depends non-trivially on the geometry of the booklet. At high-temperatures we provide the exact solution of the model by exploiting the replica symmetry. This is the permutation symmetry among the fictitious replicas that are used to perform disorder averages (via the replica trick). In the glassy phase the replica symmetry has to be broken. Using a generalization of the Parisi solution, we provide analytical results for S_n and I_n, and for standard thermodynamic quantities. Both S_n and I_n exhibit a volume law in the whole phase diagram. We characterize the behavior of the corresponding densities S_n/N, I_n/N, in the thermodynamic limit.

43556,0,"Fossil Group Origins VII. Galaxy substructures in fossil systems Fossil groups are expected to be the final product of galaxy merging within galaxy groups. In simulations, they are predicted to assemble their mass at high redshift. This early formation allows for the innermost $M^\ast$ galaxies to merge into a massive central galaxy. Then, they are expected to maintain their fossil status because of the few interactions with the large-scale structure. In this context, the magnitude gap between the two brightest galaxies of the system is considered a good indicator of its dynamical status. As a consequence, the systems with the largest gaps should be dynamically relaxed. In order to examine the dynamical status of these systems, we systematically analyze, for the first time, the presence of galaxy substructures in a sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil systems with redshift $z \le 0.25$. We apply a number of tests in order to investigate the substructure in fossil systems in the two-dimensional space of projected positions out to $R_{200}$. Moreover, for a subsample of 5 systems with at least 30 spectroscopically-confirmed members we also analyze the substructure in the velocity and in the three-dimensional velocity-position spaces. Additionally, we look for signs of recent mergers in the regions around the central galaxies. We find that an important fraction of fossil systems show substructure. The fraction depends critically on the adopted test, since each test is more sensible to a particular type of substructure. Our interpretation of the results is that fossil systems are not, in general, as relaxed as expected from simulations. Our sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil systems need to be extended in order to compute an accurate fraction, but our conclusion is that it is similar to the fraction of substructure detected in non-fossil clusters.

43591,0,A broadband Ferromagnetic Resonance dipper probe for magnetic damping measurements from 4.2 K to 300 K A dipper probe for broadband Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) operating from 4.2 K to room temperature is described. The apparatus is based on a 2-port transmitted microwave signal measurement with a grounded coplanar waveguide. The waveguide generates a microwave field and records the sample response. A 3-stage dipper design is adopted for fast and stable temperature control. The temperature variation due to FMR is in the milli-Kelvin range at liquid helium temperature. We also designed a novel FMR probe head with a spring-loaded sample holder. Improved signal-to-noise ratio and stability compared to a common FMR head are achieved. Using a superconducting vector magnet we demonstrate Gilbert damping measurements on two thin film samples using a vector network analyzer with frequency up to 26 GHz: 1) A Permalloy film of 5 nm thickness and 2) a CoFeB film of 1.5 nm thickness.

43880,0,"Modelling the Evolution of Ly$\alpha$ Blobs and Ly$\alpha$ Emitters In this work we model the observed evolution in comoving number density of Lyman-alpha blobs (LABs) as a function of redshift, and try to find which mechanism of emission is dominant in LAB. Our model calculates LAB emission both from cooling radiation from the intergalactic gas accreting onto galaxies and from star formation (SF). We have used dark matter (DM) cosmological simulation to which we applied empirical recipes for Ly$\alpha$ emission produced by cooling radiation and SF in every halo. In difference to the previous work, the simulated volume in the DM simulation is large enough to produce an average LABs number density. At a range of redshifts $z\sim 1-7$ we compare our results with the observed luminosity functions of LABs and LAEs. Our cooling radiation luminosities appeared to be too small to explain LAB luminosities at all redshifts. In contrast, for SF we obtained a good agreement with observed LFs at all redshifts studied. We also discuss uncertainties which could influence the obtained results, and how LAB LFs could be related to each other in fields with different density.",1
43889,0,On a certain type of nonlinear hyperbolic equations derived from astrophysical problems Investigations of spherically symmetric motions of self-gravitating gaseous stars governed by the non-relativistic Newtonian gravitation theory or by the general relativistic theory lead us to a certain type of non-linear hyperbolic equations defined on a finite interval of the space variable. The linearized principal part has regular singularities at the both ends of the interval of the space variable. But the regularity loss caused by the singularities at the boundaries requires application of the Nash-Moser technique. An abstract unified treatment of the problem is presented.,1
44029,0,"Learning the Correction for Multi-Path Deviations in Time-of-Flight Cameras The Multipath effect in Time-of-Flight(ToF) cameras still remains to be a challenging problem that hinders further processing of 3D data information. Based on the evidence from previous literature, we explored the possibility of using machine learning techniques to correct this effect. Firstly, we created two new datasets of of ToF images rendered via ToF simulator of LuxRender. These two datasets contain corners in multiple orientations and with different material properties. We chose scenes with corners as multipath effects are most pronounced in corners. Secondly, we used this dataset to construct a learning model to predict real valued corrections to the ToF data using Random Forests. We found out that in our smaller dataset we were able to predict real valued correction and improve the quality of depth images significantly by removing multipath bias. With our algorithm, we improved relative per-pixel error from average value of 19% to 3%. Additionally, variance of the error was lowered by an order of magnitude.",1

44203,0,"Quantum Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation from a small neutral particle moving parallel to a transparent dielectric plate We study the quantum Vavilov-Cherenkov (QVC) radiation and quantum friction occurring during motion of a small neutral particle parallel to a transparent dielectric plate with the refractive index $n$. This phenomenon occurs above the threshold velocity $v_c=c/n$. The particle acceleration and rate of heating are determined by the friction force and heating power in the rest reference frame of the particle. We calculate these quantities starting from the expressions for the friction force and the radiative energy transfer in the plate-plate configuration, assuming plate at the rest in the \textit{lab} frame rarefied. Close to the light velocity there is a big difference between the friction force and the radiation power in the rest frame of a particle and in the \textit{lab} reference frame. This difference is connected with the change of the rest mass of the particle due to absorption of radiation. Close to the threshold velocity the decrease of the kinetic energy of the particle is determined mainly by radiation power in in the \textit{lab} frame. However, close to the light velocity it is determined also by the heating power for the particle. We establish the connections between the quantities in the different reference frames. For a nanoparticle the QVC radiation intensity can be comparable to classical one. We discuss the possibility to detect QVC radiation.",1
44208,0,"Molien series and low-degree invariants for a natural action of ${\bf SO}(3)\wr{\bf Z}_2$ We investigate the invariants of the $25$-dimensional real representation of the group ${\bf SO}(3)\wr{\bf Z}_2$ given by the left and right actions of ${\bf SO}(3)$ on $5\times 5$ matrices together with matrix transposition; the action on column vectors is the irreducible $5$-dimensional representation of ${\bf SO}(3)$. The $25$-dimensional representation arises naturally in the study of nematic liquid crystals, where the second-rank orientational order parameters of a molecule are represented by a symmetric $3\times3$ traceless symmetric matrix, and where a rigid rotation in ${\bf R}^3$ induces a linear transformation of this space of matrices. The entropy contribution to a free energy density function in this context turns out to have ${\bf SO}(3)\wr{\bf Z}_2$ symmetry. Although it is unrealistic to expect to describe the complete algebraic structure of the ring of invariants, we are able to calculate the Molien series giving the number of linearly independent invariants at each homogeneous degree, and to express this as a rational function indicating the degrees of invariant polynomials that constitute a basis of 19 primary invariants. The algebra of invariants up to degree 4 is investigated in detail.",1

44979,0,"Highly ionized xenon and volumetric weighting in restricted focal geometries The ionization of xenon atoms subjected to 42fs, 800nm pulses of radiation from a Ti:Sapphire laser was investigated. In our experiments a maximum laser intensity of $\sim2\times 10^{15} \textrm{W}/\textrm{cm}^2$ was used. Xenon ions were measured using a time-of-flight ion mass spectrometer having an entrance slit with dimensions of $12\mu \textrm{m} \times 400\mu \textrm{m}$. The observed yields $\textrm{Xe}^{n+} (n=1-7)$ were partially free of spatial averaging. The ion yields showed sequential and nonsequential multiple ionization and dip structures following saturation. To investigate the dip structures and to perform a comparison between experimental and simulated data, with the goal of clarifying the effects of residual spatial averaging, we derived a hybrid analytical-numerical solution for the integration kernel in restricted focal geometries. We simulated xenon ionization using Ammosov-Delone-Krainov and Perelomov-Popov-Terent'ev theories and obtained agreement with the results of observations. Since a large number of experiments suffer from spatial averaging, the results presented are important to correctly interpret experimental data by taking into account spatial averaging.",1

45152,0,"Suppression of galactic outflows by cosmological infall and circumgalactic medium We investigate the relative importance of two galactic outflow suppression mechanisms : a) Cosmological infall of the intergalactic gas onto the galaxy, and b) the existence of a hot circumgalactic medium (CGM). Considering only radial motion, the infall reduces the speed of outflowing gas and even halts the outflow, depending on the mass and redshift of the galaxy. For star forming galaxies there exists an upper mass limit beyond which outflows are suppressed by the gravitational field of the galaxy. We find that infall can reduce this upper mass limit approximately by a factor of two (independent of the redshift). Massive galaxies ($\gtrsim 10^{12} M_{\odot}$) host large reservoir of hot, diffuse CGM around the central part of the galaxy. The CGM acts as a barrier between the infalling and outflowing gas and provides an additional source of outflow suppression. We find that at low redshifts ($z\lesssim3.5$), the CGM is more effective than the infall in suppressing the outflows. Together, these two processes give a mass range in which galaxies are unable to have effective outflows. We also discuss the impact of outflow suppression on the enrichment history of the galaxy and its environment.",1
45180,0,"Scheme for accelerating quantum tunneling dynamics We propose a scheme of the exact fast-forwarding of standard quantum dynamics for a charged particle. The present idea allows the acceleration of both the amplitude and phase of the wave function throughout the fast-forward time range and is distinct from that of Masuda-Nakamura (e.g., Proc. R. Soc. A {\bf 466}, 1135 (2010)) which enabled acceleration of only the amplitude of the wave function on the way. We shall apply the proposed method to the quantum tunneling phenomena and obtain the electro-magnetic field to ensure the rapid penetration of wave functions through a tunneling barrier. Typical examples described here are: 1) an exponential wave packet passing through the delta-function barrier; 2) the opened Moshinsky shutter with a delta-function barrier just behind the shutter. We elucidate the tunneling current in the vicinity of the barrier and find the remarkable enhancement of the tunneling rate (: tunneling power) due to the fast-forwarding. In the case of a very high barrier, in particular, we present the asymptotic analysis and exhibit a suitable driving force to recover a recognizable tunneling current. The analysis is also carried out on the exact acceleration of macroscopic quantum tunneling with use of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation which accommodates a tunneling barrier.",1
45187,0,"Can Anomalous Amplification be Attained Without Postselection? We present a parameter estimation technique based on performing joint measurements of a weak interaction away from the weak-value-amplification approximation. Two detectors are used to collect full statistics of the correlations between two weakly entangled degrees of freedom. Without the need of postselection, the protocol resembles the anomalous amplification of an imaginary-weak-value-like response. The amplification is induced in the difference signal of both detectors allowing robustness to different sources of technical noise, and offering in addition the advantages of balanced signals for precision metrology. All of the Fisher information about the parameter of interest is collected, and a phase controls the amplification response. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed technique by measuring polarization rotations in a linearly polarized laser pulse. The effective sensitivity and precision of a split detector is increased when compared to a conventional continuous-wave balanced detection technique.",1

In 1963 Brink and Stephen [Phys. Lett. 5, 77 (1963)] proposed a method for its determination by simply counting the number of maxima featured by the cross sections as function of the parameter under consideration. They, actually, stated that the product of the average number of maxima per unit energy range and Gamma_corr is constant in the Ercison region of strongly overlapping resonances. We use the analogy between the scattering formalism for compound-nucleus reactions and for microwave resonators to test this method experimentally with unprecedented accuracy using large data sets and propose an analytical description for the regions of isolated and overlapping resonances.",1

45438,0,"The Gini Coefficient as a Tool for Image Family Idenitification in Strong Lensing Systems with Multiple Images The sample of cosmological strong lensing systems has been steadily growing in recent years and with the advent of the next generation of space-based survey telescopes, the sample will reach into the thousands. The accuracy of strong lens models relies on robust identification of multiple image families of lensed galaxies. For the most massive lenses, often more than one background galaxy is magnified and multiply-imaged, and even in the cases of only a single lensed source, identification of counter images is not always robust. Recently, we have shown that the Gini coefficient in space-telescope-quality imaging is a measurement of galaxy morphology that is relatively well-preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Here, we investigate its usefulness as a diagnostic for the purposes of image family identification and show that it can remove some of the degeneracies encountered when using color as the sole diagnostic, and can do so without the need for additional observations since whenever a color is available, two Gini coefficients are as well.",1
45442,0,"Exact two-time correlation and response functions in the one-dimensional coagulation-diffusion process by the empty-interval-particle method The one-dimensional coagulation-diffusion process describes the strongly fluctuating dynamics of particles, freely hopping between the nearest-neighbour sites of a chain such that one of them disappears with probability 1 if two particles meet. The exact two-time correlation and response function in the one-dimensional coagulation-diffusion process are derived from the empty-interval-particle method. The main quantity is the conditional probability of finding an empty interval of n consecutive sites, if at distance d a site is occupied by a particle. Closed equations of motion are derived such that the probabilities needed for the calculation of correlators and responses, respectively, are distinguished by different initial and boundary conditions. In this way, the dynamical scaling of these two-time observables is analysed in the longtime ageing regime. A new generalised fluctuation-dissipation ratio with an universal and finite limit is proposed.",1

45974,0,"Gravitational acceleration and edge effects in molecular clouds Gravity plays important roles in the evolution of molecular clouds. We present an acceleration mapping method to estimate the acceleration induced by gravitational interactions in molecular clouds based on observational data. We find that the geometry of a region has a significant impact on the behavior of gravity. In the Pipe nebula which can be approximated as a gas filament, we find that gravitational acceleration can effectively compress the end of this filament, which may have triggered star formation. We identify this as the ""gravitational focusing"" effect proposed by Burkert &amp; Hartman (2004). In the sheet-like IC348-B3 region, gravity can lead to collapse at its edge, while in the centrally condensed NGC1333 cluster-forming region gravity can drive accretion towards the center. In general, gravitational acceleration tends to be enhanced in the localized regions around the ends of the filaments and the edges of sheet-like structures. Neglecting magnetic fields, these ""gravitational focusing"" and ""edge collapse"" effects can promote the formation of dense gas in a timescale that is much shorter than the global dynamical time. Since the interstellar medium is in general structured, these edge effects should be prevalent.",1

These operators are generalizations of the Kirillov-Noumi \cite{kinoum} Macdonald raising operators, in the dual $q$-Whittaker limit $t\to\infty$.

This system is a subalgebra of a quantum cluster algebra, and is also a discrete integrable system whose conserved quantities, analogous to the Casimirs of $U_q({\mathfrak sl}_{r+1})$, act as difference operators on the above family of symmetric polynomials. The characters in the special case of products of fundamental modules are class I $q$-Whittaker functions, or characters of level-1 Demazure modules or Weyl modules.

46527,0,"Direct Evidence of the Transition from Weak to Strong MHD Turbulence One of the most important predictions in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is that in the presence of a uniform magnetic field $\textbf{b}_{0}$ a transition from weak to strong wave turbulence should occur when going from large to small perpendicular scales. This transition is believed to be a universal property of several anisotropic turbulent systems. We present for the first time direct evidence of such a transition thanks to a three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of incompressible balanced MHD turbulence with a grid resolution of $3072^2 \times 256$. From large to small-scales, the change of regime is characterized by i) a change of slope in the energy spectrum going from approximately $-2$ to $-3/2$; ii) an increase of the ratio between the wave and nonlinear times, with a critical ratio of $\chi_{c}\sim0.35$; iii) an absence followed by a dramatic increase of the communication between Alfv\'en modes; and iv) a modification of the iso-contours of energy revealing a transition from a purely perpendicular cascade to a cascade compatible with the critical balance type phenomenology. All these changes happen at approximately the same transition scale and therefore can be seen as manifest signatures of the transition from weak to strong wave turbulence.",1

46665,0,"Minimal Radius of Magnetic Skyrmions: Statics and Dynamics In a broad range of applied magnetic fields and material parameters isolated magnetic skyrmions condense into skyrmion lattices. While the geometry of isolated skyrmions and their lattice counterparts strongly depend on field and Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction, this issue has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. Meanwhile, this information is extremely important for applications, because the skyrmion size and the interskyrmion distance have to be tuned for skyrmion based memory and logic devices. In this investigation we elucidate the size and density-dependent phase diagram showing traditional phases in field vs. material parameters space by means of Monte-Carlo simulations on a discrete lattice. The obtained diagram permits us to establish that, in contrast to the continuum limit, skyrmions on a discrete lattice cannot be smaller than some critical size and have a very specific shape. These minimal skyrmions correspond to the micromagnetic configuration at the energy barrier between the ferromagnetic and the skyrmionic states. Furthermore, we use atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations to study dynamics of the skyrmion annihilation. It is shown that this procees consists of two stages: the continuous skyrmion contraction and its discontinuous annihilation. The detailed analysis of this dynamical process is given.",1

For this comparison, we use a version of mathematical definability theory in which new entities can also be defined besides new relations over already available entities. In particular, we build an interpretation of the reference-frame oriented theory SpecRel into the observationally oriented Signalling theory of James Ax. This interpretation provides SpecRel with an operational/experimental semantics.

46840,0,"Flash ionisation signature in coherent cyclotron emission from Brown Dwarfs Brown dwarfs form mineral clouds in their atmospheres, where charged particles can produce large-scale discharges in form of lightning resulting in a substantial sudden increase of local ionisation. Brown dwarfs are observed to emit cyclotron radio emission. We show that signatures of strong transient atmospheric ionisation events (flash ionisation) can be imprinted on a pre-existing radiation. Detection of such flash ionisation events will open investigations into the ionisation state and atmospheric dynamics. Such ionisation events can also result from explosion shock waves, bursts or eruptions. We present an analytical model that describes the modulation of a pre-existing electromagnetic radiation by a time-dependent (flash) conductivity that is characteristic for flash ionisation events like lightning. Our conductivity model reproduces the conductivity function derived from observations of Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes, and is applicable to astrophysical objects with strong temporal variations in the local ionization, as in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary disks. We show that the field responds with a characteristic flash-shaped pulse to a conductivity flash of intermediate intensity. More powerful ionisation events result in smaller variations of the initial radiation, or in its damping. We show that the characteristic damping of the response field for high-power initial radiation carries information about the ionisation flash magnitude and duration. The duration of the pulse amplification or the damping is consistently shorter for larger conductivity variations and can be used to evaluate the intensity of the flash ionisation. Our work suggests that cyclotron emission could be probe signals for electrification processes inside BD atmosphere.",1
46861,0,"Broadband illumination of superconducting pair breaking photon detectors Understanding the detailed behaviour of superconducting pair breaking photon detectors such as Kinetic Inductance Detectors requires knowledge of the nonequilibrium quasiparticle energy distributions. We have previously calculated the steady state distributions resulting from uniform absorption of monochromatic sub gap and above gap frequency radiation by thin films. In this work, we use the same methods to calculate the effect of illumination by broadband sources, such as thermal radiation from astrophysical phenomena or from the readout system. Absorption of photons at multiple above gap frequencies is shown to not change the structure of the quasiparticle energy distribution close to the superconducting gap. Hence for typical absorbed powers, we find the effects of absorption of broadband pair breaking radiation can simply be considered as the sum of the effects of absorption of many monochromatic sources. Distribution averaged quantities, like quasiparticle generation effciency $\eta$, match exactly a weighted average over the bandwidth of the source of calculations assuming a monochromatic source. For sub gap frequencies, however, distributing the absorbed power across multiple frequencies does change the low energy quasiparticle distribution. For moderate and high absorbed powers, this results in a significantly larger $\eta$ - a higher number of excess quasiparticles for a broadband source compared to a monochromatic source of equal total absorbed power. Typically in KIDs the microwave power absorbed has a very narrow bandwidth, but in devices with broad resonance characteristics (low quality factors), this increase in $\eta$ may be measurable.",1

We reformulate the classical scattering calculations in a more transparent way using modern SI-compatible quantities extended to field correlation matrices. The resulting concise formulation is easily extended to the case of relativistic electrons. For relativistic electrons we calculate the Stokes parameters of the scattered radiation and determine changes in degree and orientation of its polarisation, blue-shift and radiant intensities depending on the electron velocity magnitude and direction. We discuss the probability to see these relativistic effects in white-light coronagraph observations of the solar corona. Many mathematical and some basic physical ingredients are made explicit in several chapters of the appendix.",1

It is instead possible, by exploiting considerations introduced by P. Epstein and A.

When the oscillator is used as a force sensor, such as in atomic force microscopy, active feedback is an enticing route to enhancing measurement performance. Here, we show broadband multimode cooling of $-23$ dB down to a temperature of $8 \pm 1$~K in the stationary regime. Through the use of periodic quiescence feedback cooling, we show improved signal-to-noise ratios for the measurement of transient signals. We compare the performance of real feedback to numerical post-processing of data and show that both methods produce similar improvements to the signal-to-noise ratio of force measurements. We achieved a room temperature force measurement sensitivity of $&lt; 2\times10^{-16}$ N with integration time of less than $0.1$ ms.

47333,0,"Spectral Synthesis via Mean Field approach Independent Component Analysis In this paper, we apply a new statistical analysis technique, Mean Field approach to Bayesian Independent Component Analysis (MF-ICA), on galaxy spectral analysis. This algorithm can compress the stellar spectral library into a few Independent Components (ICs), and galaxy spectrum can be reconstructed by these ICs. Comparing to other algorithms which decompose a galaxy spectrum into a combination of several simple stellar populations, MF-ICA approach offers a large improvement in the efficiency. To check the reliability of this spectral analysis method, three different methods are used: (1) parameter-recover for simulated galaxies, (2) comparison with parameters estimated by other methods, and (3) consistency test of parameters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. We find that our MF-ICA method not only can fit the observed galaxy spectra efficiently, but also can recover the physical parameters of galaxies accurately. We also apply our spectral analysis method to the DEEP2 spectroscopic data, and find it can provide excellent fitting for those low signal-to-noise spectra.",1

47622,0,"Classification of stable Dirac and Weyl semimetals with reflection and rotational symmetry Three dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal is a novel state of quantum matter, characterized by the gapless bulk four-fold degeneracy near Fermi energy. Soon after its discovery, the classification of stable 3D Dirac semimetals with inversion and rotational symmetry have been studied. However, only ten out of thirty-two point groups have both inversion and rotational symmetry, and we need a more complete classification of stable 3D Dirac semimetals. Here we classify stable 3D Dirac semimetals with reflection symmetry and rotational symmetry in the presence of time reversal symmetry, which belong to seventeen different point groups. These systems include the systems preserving inversion symmetry except $\mathrm{C_{3i}}$. They have two classes of reflection symmetry, with the mirror plane parallel to rotation axis and the mirror plane perpendicular to rotation axis. In both cases two types of Dirac semimetals are determined by four different reflection symmetries. The first type of Dirac semimetals will appear through accidental band crossing (ABC). The second type of Dirac semimetals have a Dirac point at a time reversal invariant momentum (TBC). We show that in both mirror parallel and perpendicular cases, $C_{2,3}$ symmetry can only protect stable Dirac points via TBC, while $C_{4,6}$ symmetry can have stable Dirac points as ABC or TBC. We further discuss that Weyl line nodes and Dirac semimetal can exist in Brillouin zone at the same time using $\mathrm{C_{4v}}$ symmetry as an example. Finally we classify Dirac line nodes and Weyl line nodes to show in which types of mirror plane they can exist.",1
47805,0,"Plasma probe characteristics in low density hydrogen pulsed plasmas Probe theories are only applicable in the regime where the probe's perturbation of the plasma can be neglected. However, it is not always possible to know, a priori, that a particular probe theory can be successfully applied, especially in low density plasmas. This is especially difficult in the case of transient, low density plasmas. Here, we applied probe diagnostics in combination with a 2D particle-in-cell model, to an experiment with a pulsed low density hydrogen plasma. The calculations took into account the full chamber geometry, including the plasma probe as an electrode in the chamber. It was found that the simulations reproduce the time evolution of the probe IV characteristics with good accuracy. The disagreement between the simulated and probe measured plasma density is attributed to the limited applicability of probe theory to measurements of low density pulsed plasmas. Indeed, in the case studied here, probe measurements would lead to a large overestimate of the plasma density. In contrast, the simulations of the plasma evolution and the probe characteristics do not suffer from such strict applicability limits. These studies show that probe theory cannot be justified through probe measurements.",1

In particular, we discuss the problem of dynamical invariance of the kinetic energy under the action of the whole affine group, not only under the isometry subgroup. Technically, the treatment is based on the two-polar decomposition of the matrix of the internal configuration and on the Peter-Weyl theory of generalized Fourier series on Lie groups.

Working with a multiband Pauli Hamiltonian, we obtain from the Kubo formula a simple expression for $\alpha^{\rm gme}_{ij}=j^{\rm{\bf B}}_i/B_j$ in terms of the intrinsic magnetic moment (orbital plus spin) of the Bloch electrons on the Fermi surface. An alternate semiclassical derivation provides an intuitive picture of the effect, and takes into account the influence of scattering processes in dirty metals. This ""gyrotropic magnetic effect"" is fundamentally different from the chiral magnetic effect driven by the chiral anomaly and governed by the Berry curvature on the Fermi surface, and the two effects are compared for a minimal model of a Weyl semimetal. Like the Berry curvature, the intrinsic magnetic moment should be regarded as a basic ingredient in the Fermi-liquid description of transport in broken-symmetry metals.",1

The model is based on the equations of modified MHD, that describe the mean flow parameters in the wave MHD turbulence. Diffusion of the magnetic field and radiative heating and cooling are taken into account. The suitability of the model is confirmed by modeling the accretion in a typical intermediate polar. The computations show that a magnetosphere forms around the accretor, with the accretion occurring via columns. The accretion columns have a curtain-like shape, and arc-shaped zones of energy release form on the surface of the white dwarf in the magnetic poles area as a result of the matter infall.",1

Pop~III stars with masses below $0.8 M_\odot$ should survive to date though are not observed yet, but the existence of stars with low metallicity as [Fe/H]$ &lt; -5$ in the Milky Way halo suggests the surface pollution of Pop~III stars with accreted metals from the interstellar gas after birth. In this paper, we investigate the runaway of Pop~III stars from their host mini-halos, considering the ejection of secondary members from binary systems when their massive primaries explode as supernovae. These stars save them from the surface pollution. By computing the star formation and chemical evolution along with the hierarchical structure formation based on the extended Press--Schechter merger trees, we demonstrate that several hundreds to tens of thousands of low-mass Pop~III stars escape from the building blocks of the Milky Way. The second and later generations of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars are also escaped from the mini-halos. We discuss the spatial distributions of these escaped stars by evaluating the distances between the mini-halos in the branches of merger trees under the spherical collapse model of dark matter halos. It is demonstrated that the escaped stars distribute beyond the stellar halo with a density profile close to the dark matter halo, while the Pop~III stars are slightly more centrally concentrated . Some escaped stars leave the Milky Way and spread into the intergalactic space. Based on the results, we discuss the feasibility of observing the Pop~III stars with the pristine surface abundance.",1

The rms electron density of the X-ray-emitting gas is estimated to be $n_\mathrm{e}$=0.4 cm$^{-3}$. The high-quality observations presented here reveal spectral variations within different regions in NGC6888, which allowed us for the first time to detect temperature and/or nitrogen abundance inhomogeneities in the hot gas inside a WR nebula. One possible explanation for such spectral variations is that the mixing of material from the outer nebula into the hot bubble is less efficient around the caps than in other nebular regions.",1

The system displays either a self-screened Kondo effect, or a Kondo effect with SO(3) or SO(4) dynamical symmetries. Low temperature Kondo scattering for systems with SO(3) symmetry displays the behavior of a singular Fermi liquid, an elusive property that so far has been observed only in tunneling experiments. This is demonstrated through the singular behavior as $T \to 0$ of the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility and impurity resistivity, that are calculated using well known (slightly adapted) conformal field theory techniques. Quite generally, the low temperature dependence of some of these observables displays a remarkable distinction between the SO(n=3,4) Kondo effect, compared with the standard SU(2) one.",1

49277,0,"Investigating Particle Acceleration in Protostellar Jets: The Triple Radio Continuum Source in Serpens While most protostellar jets present free-free emission at radio wavelengths, synchrotron emission has been also proposed to be present in a handful of these objects. The presence of non-thermal emission has been inferred by negative spectral indices at centimeter wavelengths. In one case (the HH 80-81 jet arising from a massive protostar), its synchrotron nature was confirmed by the detection of linearly polarized radio emission. One of the main consequences of these results is that synchrotron emission implies the presence of relativistic particles among the non-relativistic material of these jets. Therefore, an acceleration mechanism should be taking place. The most probable scenario is that particles are accelerated when the jets strongly impact against the dense envelope surrounding the protostar. Here, we present an analysis of radio observations obtained with the Very Large Array of the Triple Radio Source in the Serpens star-forming region. This object is known to be a radio jet arising from an intermediate-mass protostar. It is also one of the first protostellar jets where the presence of non-thermal emission was proposed.

Here we propose a tunable polarized radiation source from a helical plasma undulator based on plasma channel guided wakefield accelerator. When a laser pulse is initially incident with a skew angle relative to the channel axis, the laser and accelerated electrons experience collective spiral motions, which leads to elliptically polarized synchrotron-like radiation with flexible tunability on radiation intensity, spectra and polarization. We demonstrate that a radiation source with millimeter size and peak brilliance of $2\times10^{19} photons/s/mm^{2}/mrad^{2}/0.1%$ bandwidth can be made with moderate laser and electron beam parameters.

49872,0,"Stable Gapless Bose Liquid Phases without any Symmetry It is well-known that a stable algebraic spin liquid state (or equivalently an algebraic Bose liquid (ABL) state) with emergent gapless photon excitations can exist in quantum spin ice systems, or in a quantum dimer model on a bipartite $3d$ lattice. This photon phase is stable against any weak perturbation without assuming any symmetry. Further works concluded that certain lattice models give rise to more exotic stable algebraic Bose liquid phases with graviton-like excitations. In this paper we will show how these algebraic Bose liquid states can be generalized to stable phases with even more exotic types of gapless excitations and then argue that these new phases are stable against weak perturbations. We also explicitly show that these theories have an (algebraic) topological ground state degeneracy on a torus, and construct the corresponding topological invariants.",1
49950,0,"Multiple testing of local maxima for detection of peaks on the (celestial) sphere We present a topological multiple testing scheme for detecting peaks on the sphere under isotropic Gaussian noise, where tests are performed at local maxima of the observed field filtered by the spherical needlet transform. Our setting is different from the standard Euclidean/large same asymptotic framework, yet highly relevant to realistic experimental circumstances for some important areas of application in astronomy. More precisely, we focus on cases where a single realization of a smooth isotropic Gaussian random field on the sphere is observed, and a number of well-localized signals are superimposed on such background field. The proposed algorithms, combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for thresholding p-values, provide asymptotic strong control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and power consistency as the signal strength and the frequency of the needlet transform get large. This novel multiple testing method is illustrated in a simulation of point-source detection in Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB) data.",1
50044,0,"Influence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the Kondo effect An Anderson model for a magnetic impurity in a two-dimensional electron gas with bulk Rashba spin-orbit interaction is solved using the numerical renormalization group under two different experimental scenarios. For a fixed Fermi energy, the Kondo temperature T_K varies weakly with Rashba coupling \alpha, as reported previously. If instead the band filling is low and held constant, increasing \alpha can drive the system into a helical regime with exponential enhancement of T_K. Under either scenario, thermodynamic properties at low temperatures T exhibit the same dependences on T/T_K as are found for \alpha = 0. Unlike the conventional Kondo effect, however, the impurity exhibits static spin correlations with conduction electrons of nonzero orbital angular momentum about the impurity site. We also consider a magnetic field that Zeeman splits the conduction band but not the impurity level, an effective picture that arises under a proposed route to access the helical regime in a driven system. The impurity contribution to the system's ground-state angular momentum is found to be a universal function of the ratio of the Zeeman energy to a temperature scale that is not T_K (as would be the case in a magnetic field that couples directly to the impurity spin), but rather is proportional to T_K divided by the impurity hybridization width. This universal scaling is explained via a perturbative treatment of field-induced changes in the electronic density of states.",1

The dependence of the luminosity of the emission at the peak frequency with the linear size and the peak frequency is also presented for the galaxies in the sample. The luminosity of the smaller sources evolve strongly with the linear size. Optical depth effects have been included to the 3D model for the radio source of Kaiser (2000) to study the spectral turnover. Using this model, the observed trend can be explained by synchrotron self absorption. The observed trend in the peak-frequency -- linear-size plane is not affected by the luminosity evolution of the sources.",1

50204,0,"On a method for constructing the Lax pairs for nonlinear integrable equations We suggest a direct algorithm for searching the Lax pairs for nonlinear integrable equations. It is effective for both continuous and discrete models. The first operator of the Lax pair corresponding to a given nonlinear equation is found immediately, coinciding with the linearization of the considered nonlinear equation. The second one is obtained as an invariant manifold to the linearized equation. A surprisingly simple relation between the second operator of the Lax pair and the recursion operator is discussed: the recursion operator can immediately be found from the Lax pair. Examples considered in the article are convincing evidence that the found Lax pairs differ from the classical ones. The examples also show that the suggested objects are true Lax pairs which allow the construction of infinite series of conservation laws and hierarchies of higher symmetries. In the case of the hyperbolic type partial differential equation our algorithm is slightly modified; in order to construct the Lax pairs from the invariant manifolds we use the cutting off conditions for the corresponding infinite Laplace sequence. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by application to some equations given in the Svinolupov-Sokolov classification list for which the Lax pairs and the recursion operators have not been found earlier.",1

50278,0,"Dynamo saturation in direct simulations of the multi-phase turbulent interstellar medium The ordered magnetic field observed via polarized synchrotron emission in nearby disc galaxies can be explained by a mean-field dynamo operating in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Additionally, vertical-flux initial conditions are potentially able to influence this dynamo via the occurrence of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We aim to study the influence of various initial field configurations on the saturated state of the mean-field dynamo. This is motivated by the observation that different saturation behavior was previously obtained for different supernova rates. We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of three-dimensional local boxes of the vertically stratified, turbulent interstellar medium, employing shearing-periodic boundary conditions horizontally. Unlike in our previous work, we also impose a vertical seed magnetic field. We run the simulations until the growth of the magnetic energy becomes negligible. We furthermore perform simulations of equivalent 1D dynamo models, with an algebraic quenching mechanism for the dynamo coefficients. We compare the saturation of the magnetic field in the DNS with the algebraic quenching of a mean-field dynamo. The final magnetic field strength found in the direct simulation is in excellent agreement with a quenched $\alpha\Omega$~dynamo. For supernova rates representative of the Milky Way, field losses via a Galactic wind are likely responsible for saturation. We conclude that the relative strength of the turbulent and regular magnetic fields in spiral galaxies may depend on the galaxy's star formation rate. We propose that a mean field approach with algebraic quenching may serve as a simple sub-grid scale model for galaxy evolution simulations including a prescribed feedback from magnetic fields.",1

These developments aim to extend the application, improve the speed and/or simplify the implementation of data augmentation methods, such as the deterministic EM algorithm for mode finding and stochastic Gibbs sampler and other auxiliary-variable based methods for posterior sampling. In this overview article we graphically illustrate and compare a number of these extensions, all of which aim to maintain the simplicity and computation stability of their predecessors. We particularly emphasize the usefulness of identifying similarities between the deterministic and stochastic counterparts as we seek more efficient computational strategies. We also demonstrate the applicability of data augmentation methods for handling complex models with highly hierarchical structure, using a high-energy high-resolution spectral imaging model for data from satellite telescopes, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory.",1
50326,0,"Discovery of extreme [OIII]5007A outflows in high-redshift red quasars Black hole feedback is now a standard component of galaxy formation models. These models predict that the impact of black hole activity on its host galaxy likely peaked at z=2-3, the epoch of strongest star formation activity and black hole accretion activity in the Universe. We used XShooter on the Very Large Telescope to measure rest-frame optical spectra of four z~2.5 extremely red quasars with infrared luminosities ~10^47 erg/sec. We present the discovery of very broad (full width at half max= 2600-5000 km/sec), strongly blue-shifted (by up to 1500 km/sec) [OIII]5007A emission lines in these objects. In a large sample of obscured and red quasars, [OIII] kinematics are positively correlated with infrared luminosity, and the four objects in our sample are on the extreme end both in [OIII] kinematics and infrared luminosity. We estimate that ~3% of the bolometric luminosity in these objects is being converted into the kinetic power of the observed wind. Photo-ionization estimates suggest that the [OIII] emission might be extended on a few kpc scales, which would suggest that the extreme outflow is affecting the entire host galaxy of the quasar. These sources may be the signposts of the most extreme form of quasar feedback at the peak epoch of galaxy formation, and may represent an active ""blow-out"" phase of quasar evolution.",1
50387,0,"Time-Frequency analysis via the Fourier Representation The nonstationary nature of signals and nonlinear systems require the time-frequency representation. In time-domain signal, frequency information is derived from the phase of the Gabor's analytic signal which is practically obtained by the inverse Fourier transform. This study presents time-frequency analysis by the Fourier transform which maps the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain. In this study, we derive the time information from the phase of the frequency-domain signal and obtain the time-frequency representation. In order to obtain the time information in Fourier domain, we define the concept of `frequentaneous time' which is frequency derivative of phase. This is very similar to the group delay, which is also defined as frequency derivative of phase and it provide physical meaning only when it is positive. The frequentaneous time is always positive or negative depending upon whether signal is defined for only positive or negative times, respectively. If a signal is defined for both positive and negative times, then we divide the signal into two parts, signal for positive times and signal for negative times. The proposed frequentaneous time and Fourier transform based time-frequency distribution contains only those frequencies which are present in the Fourier spectrum. Simulations and numerical results, on many simulated as well as read data, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for the time-frequency analysis of a signal.",1

In this work, we numerically construct the exact electron-photon Kohn-Sham potentials for a prototype system which consists of a trapped electron coupled to a quantized electromagnetic mode in an optical high-Q cavity. While the effective current that acts on the photons is known explicitly, the exact effective potential that describes the forces exerted by the photons on the electrons is obtained from a fixed-point inversion scheme. This procedure allows us to uncover important beyond-mean-field features of the effective potential which mark the breakdown of classical light-matter interactions. We observe peak and step structures in the effective potentials, which can be attributed solely to the quantum nature of light, i.e., they are real-space signatures of the photons. Our findings show how the ubiquitous dipole interaction with a classical electromagnetic field has to be modified in real-space in order to take the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field fully into account.",1
50808,0,"Quantum-critical scaling of fidelity in 2D pairing models The laws of quantum-critical scaling theory of quantum fidelity, dependent on the underlying system dimensionality $D$, have so far been verified in exactly solvable $1D$ models, belonging to or equivalent to interacting, quadratic (quasifree), spinless or spinfull, lattice-fermion models. The obtained results are so appealing that in quest for correlation lengths and associated universal critical indices $\nu$, which characterize the divergence of correlation lengths on approaching critical points, one might be inclined to substitute the hard task of determining an asymptotic behavior of a two-point correlation function by an easier one, of determining the quantum-critical scaling of the quantum fidelity. However, the role of system's dimensionality has been left as an open problem. Our aim in this paper is to fill up this gap, at least partially, by verifying the laws of quantum-critical scaling theory of quantum fidelity in a $2D$ case. To this end, we study correlation functions and quantum fidelity of $2D$ exactly solvable models, which are interacting, quasifree, spinfull, lattice-fermion models. The considered $2D$ models exhibit new, as compared with $1D$ ones, features:at a given quantum-critical point there exists a multitude of correlation lengths and multiple universal critical indices $\nu$, since these quantities depend on spatial directions, moreover, the indices $\nu$ may assume larger values. These facts follow from the obtained by us analytical asymptotic formulae for two-point correlation functions. In such new circumstances we discuss the behavior of quantum fidelity from the perspective of quantum-critical scaling theory. In particular, we are interested in finding out to what extent the quantum fidelity approach may be an alternative to the correlation-function approach in studies of quantum-critical points beyond 1D.",1

We select 39 candidates using the Lyman Break technique, for which the clear non-detection in optical make the extreme mid-$z$ interlopers hypothesis unlikely. We also take benefit from $z \gtrsim 6$ samples selected using previous Frontier Fields datasets of Abell 2744 and MACS0416 to improve the constraints on the properties of very high-redshift objects. We compute the redshift and the physical properties, such emission lines properties, star formation rate, reddening, and stellar mass for all Frontier Fields objects from their spectral energy distribution using templates including nebular emission lines. We study the relationship between several physical properties and confirm the trend already observed in previous surveys for evolution of star formation rate with galaxy mass, and between the size and the UV luminosity of our candidates. The analysis of the evolution of the UV Luminosity Function with redshift seems more compatible with an evolution of density. Moreover, no robust $z\ge$8.5 object is selected behind the cluster field, and few $z$$\sim$9 candidates have been selected in the two previous datasets from this legacy survey, suggesting a strong evolution in the number density of galaxies between $z$$\sim$8 and 9.

We show that in contrast to the properties of classical particles and quantum stable objects the velocity of moving freely relativistic quantum unstable systems can not be constant in time. We show that this new quantum effect results from the fundamental principles of the quantum theory and physics: It is a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy and of the fact that the mass of the quantum unstable system is not defined. This effect can affect the form of the decay law of moving relativistic quantum unstable systems.,1
51109,0,"Symmetry fractionalization and twist defects Topological order in two dimensions can be described in terms of deconfined quasiparticle excitations - anyons - and their braiding statistics. However, it has recently been realized that this data does not completely describe the situation in the presence of an unbroken global symmetry. In this case, there can be multiple distinct quantum phases with the same anyons and statistics, but with different patterns of symmetry fractionalization - termed symmetry enriched topological (SET) order. When the global symmetry group $G$, which we take to be discrete, does not change topological superselection sectors - i.e. does not change one type of anyon into a different type of anyon - one can imagine a local version of the action of $G$ around each anyon. This leads to projective representations and a group cohomology description of symmetry fractionalization, with $H^2(G,{\cal A})$ being the relevant group. In this paper, we treat the general case of a symmetry group $G$ possibly permuting anyon types. We show that despite the lack of a local action of $G$, one can still make sense of a so-called twisted group cohomology description of symmetry fractionalization, and show how this data is encoded in the associativity of fusion rules of the extrinsic `twist' defects of the symmetry. Furthermore, building on work of Hermele, we construct a wide class of exactly solved models which exhibit this twisted symmetry fractionalization, and connect them to our formal framework.",1

It is based on numerical investigations of asymmetric Heisenberg spin ladders with varied interaction strengths between the legs, i.e., along the rungs. The relaxation of the energy difference between the legs is investigated. Two different parameters, both intended to quantify the degree of accordance with the ETH, are computed. Both indicate violation of the ETH at large interaction strengths but at different thresholds. Indeed the energy difference is found not to relax independently of its initial value above some critical interaction strength which coincides with one of the thresholds. At the same point the level statistics shift from Poisson-type to Wigner-type. Hence the system may be considered to become integrable again in the strong interaction limit.",1

The method's demand for multiple images drives the need for a brighter illumination scheme and a high-frame-rate camera for a faster acquisition. We report the use of a guided laser beam as an illumination source for an FP microscope. It uses a mirror array and a 2-dimensional scanning Galvo mirror system to provide a sample with plane-wave illuminations at diverse incidence angles. The use of a laser presents speckles in the image capturing process due to reflections between glass surfaces in the system. They appear as slowly varying background fluctuations in the final reconstructed image. We are able to mitigate these artifacts by including a phase image obtained by differential phase contrast (DPC) deconvolution in the FP algorithm.

A census of Ly\alpha\ Emission at $z\gtrsim$7 from HST Spectroscopy [abbreviated] We present a census of Ly\alpha\ emission at $z\gtrsim7$ utilizing deep near infrared HST grism spectroscopy from the first six completed clusters of the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS). In 24/159 photometrically selected galaxies we detect emission lines consistent with Ly\alpha\ in the GLASS spectra. Based on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios and on simulations we expect the completeness and the purity of the sample to be 40-100% and 60-90%, respectively. For the objects without detected emission lines we show that the observed (not corrected for lensing magnification) 1$\sigma$ flux limits reaches $5\times10^{-18}$erg/s/cm$^{2}$ per position angle over the full wavelength range of GLASS (0.8-1.7$\mu$m). Based on the conditional probability of Ly\alpha\ emission measured from the ground at $z\sim7$ we would have expected 12-18 Ly\alpha\ emitters. This is consistent with the number of detections, within the uncertainties, confirming the drop in Ly\alpha\ emission with respect to $z\sim6$. These candidates include a promising source at $z=8.1$. The spatial extent of Ly\alpha\ in a deep stack of the most convincing Ly\alpha\ emitters with $\langle z\rangle=7.2$ is consistent with that of the rest-frame UV continuum. Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, if present, has a surface brightness below our detection limit, consistent with the properties of lower redshift comparison samples. From the stack we estimate upper limits on rest-frame UV emission line ratios and find $f_\textrm{CIV} / f_\textrm{Ly${\alpha}$} \lesssim 0.32$ and $f_\textrm{CIII]} / f_\textrm{Ly$\alpha$} \lesssim 0.23$ in good agreement with other values published in the literature.",1

52635,0,"X-ray Source Heights in a Solar Flare: Thick-target versus Thermal Conduction Front Heating Observations of solar flares with RHESSI have shown X-ray sources traveling along flaring loops, from the corona down to the chromosphere and back up. The 28 November 2002 C1.1 flare, first observed with RHESSI by Sui et al. 2006 and quantitatively analyzed by O'Flannagain et al. 2013, very clearly shows this behavior. By employing numerical experiments, we use these observations of X-ray source height motions as a constraint to distinguish between heating due to a non-thermal electron beam and in situ energy deposition in the corona. We find that both heating scenarios can reproduce the observed light curves, but our results favor non-thermal heating. In situ heating is inconsistent with the observed X-ray source morphology and always gives a height dispersion with photon energy opposite to what is observed.",1

52706,0,"Theoretical spectroscopy of quasars within Karlsson's law The law introduced by Karlsson in spectroscopy of low-redshift quasars involves the Lyman spectrum of hydrogen atoms. Thus, it appears necessary to study the concepts introduced by a standard spectroscopy of quasars, studied here, with those deducted from $\Lambda$-CDM.A visible absorption of a sharp and saturated spectral line in a gas requires a long path without perturbations as collisions or cosmological redshift. Spectra of absorbed, saturated lines of quasars obeying Karlsson's law mainly result from interactions of natural, thermal light radiated by quasar with relatively cold, low presure atomic hydrogen. These lines are produced by three processes: a) A conventional absorption in a relatively cold gas produces a set of lines; b) These lines are multiplied by absorption after fundamental 3K or 4K redshifts, where K is Karlsson's constant: Spectra show that redshifts 3K (or 4K) exactly bring absorbed Lyman beta (or gamma) line on Lyman alpha: redshift almost disappears, and gas lines are intensely absorbed in the absence of alpha absorption; c) Redshifts occur in regions where light at alpha frequency is poorly absorbed due to permanent redshift, except when excitation of hydrogen to 2P level is sufficient for a superradiant flash emission at alpha frequency. This causes an intense absorption of high radiance rays from quasar, so the absorption of a line at current Lyman alpha frequency. Lightning and pumping produce relaxation oscillations that write many absorption lines. Redshifts by H atoms in 2P levels are due to parametric interactions composed of Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scatterings (ISRS): excited hydrogen atoms catalyze energy exchanges between observed ray and background cold thermal radiation, in agreement with thermodynamics. Description of Universe becomes much simpler, but less marvelous.",1

Provided that the contact area is simply-connected profiles of arbitrary shape can be considered. Moreover, adhesion in the framework of the generalized JKR-theory can be taken into account. All results agree exactly with those given by three-dimensional contact theories. The method uses the fact that three-dimensional contact problems can be mapped to one-dimensional ones with a properly defined Winkler-foundation; hence, the method is to be understood as an extension of the method of dimensionality reduction. A prerequisite of its applicability forms the generality of contact stiffness regardless of the geometry of the axisymmetric profile, which is proved.

52965,0,"Differential rotation and r-modes in magnetized neutron stars Rezzolla et al. [ApJ 531 (2000), L139; Phys. Rev. D 64 (2001), 104013; Phys. Rev. D 64 (2001), 104014] draw attention to the second order secular drift associated with r-modes and claimed that it should lead to magnetic field enhancement and suppression of r-mode instability in magnetized neutron stars. We critically revise these results. We present a particular second order r-mode solution with vanishing secular drift, thus refuting a widely believed statement that secular drift is an unavoidable feature of r-modes. This non-drifting solution is not affected by magnetic field $B$, if $B\ll B_{\mathrm{crit}}\approx 10^{17}\,(\nu/600\,\mathrm{Hz})$ G ($\nu$ is a spin frequency) and does not lead to secular evolution of magnetic field. For general second order r-mode solution the drift does not necessarily vanish, but the solution can be presented as a superposition of two solutions: one describes evolution of differential rotation in nonoscillating star (which describes secular drift; for nonmagnetized star it is arbitrary stationary rotation stratified on cylinders; for magnetized star differential rotation evolves on the Alfv\'{e}n timescale and may lead to magnetic energy enhancement), and another one is non-drifting r-mode solution mentioned above. This representation allows us to conclude that enhancement of magnetic field energy is limited by initial energy of differential rotation, which is much less (for a factor $\propto \alpha^2$, where $\alpha$ is mode amplitude) than the total energy of r-mode. Hence, magnetic field enhancement by drift cannot suppress r-mode instability. Results can be generalized for any oscillation mode in any medium, if this mode has non-drifting solution for $B=0$.",1

53305,0,"Adaptive-Latency DRAM (AL-DRAM) This paper summarizes the idea of Adaptive-Latency DRAM (AL-DRAM), which was published in HPCA 2015. The key goal of AL-DRAM is to exploit the extra margin that is built into the DRAM timing parameters to reduce DRAM latency. The key observation is that the timing parameters are dictated by the worst-case temperatures and worst-case DRAM cells, both of which lead to small amount of charge storage and hence high access latency. One can therefore reduce latency by adapting the timing parameters to the current operating temperature and the current DIMM that is being accessed. Using an FPGA-based testing platform, our work first characterizes the extra margin for 115 DRAM modules from three major manufacturers. The experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to reduce four of the most critical timing parameters by a minimum/maximum of 17.3%/54.8% at 55C while maintaining reliable operation. AL-DRAM adaptively selects between multiple different timing parameters for each DRAM module based on its current operating condition. AL-DRAM does not require any changes to the DRAM chip or its interface; it only requires multiple different timing parameters to be specified and supported by the memory controller. Real system evaluations show that AL-DRAM improves the performance of memory-intensive workloads by an average of 14% without introducing any errors.",1
53332,0,"Measuring chromatic aberrations in imaging systems using plasmonic nano-particles Chromatic aberration in optical systems arises from the wavelength dependence of a glass's refractive index. Polychromatic rays incident upon an optical surface are refracted at slightly different angles and in traversing an optical system follow distinct paths creating images displaced according to color. Although arising from dispersion, it manifests as a spatial distortion correctable only with compound lenses with multiple glasses and accumulates in complicated imaging systems. While chromatic aberration is measured with interferometry, simple methods are attractive for their ease of use and low cost. In this letter we retrieve the longitudinal chromatic focal shift of high numerical aperture (NA) microscope objectives from the extinction spectra of metallic nanoparticles within the focal plane. The method is accurate for high NA objectives with apochromatic correction, and enables rapid assessment of the chromatic aberration of any complete microscopy systems, since it is straightforward to implement",1

We focus on two setups: the first one entails a single wire coupled to a bath, whereas in the second one the environment is connected to a two-leg ladder. Both settings lead to stationary states which feature the bulk properties of a p-wave superconductor, identified in this number-conserving setting through the long-distance behavior of the proper p-wave correlations. The two schemes differ in the fact that the steady state of the single wire is not characterized by topological order, whereas the two-leg ladder hosts Majorana zero modes, which are decoupled from damping and exponentially localized at the edges. Our analytical results are complemented by an extensive numerical study of the steady-state properties, of the asymptotic decay rate and of the robustness of the protocols.",1

A light-momentum criterion is set up for the first time, which states that the momentum of light in a medium is parallel to the wave vector in all inertial frames of reference. By rigorous analysis, novel basic properties of the plane wave are exposed: (a) Poynting vector does not necessarily represent the electromagnetic (EM) power flow when a medium moves; (b) Minkowski light momentum and energy constitute a Lorentz four-vector in a form of single EM-field cell or single photon, and Planck constant is a Lorentz invariant; (c) there is no momentum transfer taking place between the plane wave and the uniform medium, and the EM momentum conservation equation cannot be uniquely determined without resorting to the principle of relativity; and (d) when the medium moves opposite to the wave vector at a faster-than-dielectric light speed, negative frequency and negative EM energy density occur, with the plane wave becoming left-handed. Finally, a new physics of so-called ""intrinsic Lorentz violation"" is presented as well.",1

53720,0,"Merger Signatures in the Dynamics of Star-forming Gas Spatially resolved kinematics have been used to determine the dynamical status of star-forming galaxies with ambiguous morphologies, and constrain the importance of galaxy interactions during the assembly of galaxies. However, measuring the importance of interactions or galaxy merger rates requires knowledge of the systematics in kinematic diagnostics and the visible time with merger indicators. We analyze the dynamics of star-forming gas in a set of binary merger hydrodynamic simulations with stellar mass ratios of 1:1 and 1:4. We find that the evolution of kinematic asymmetries traced by star-forming gas mirrors morphological asymmetries derived from mock optical images, in which both merger indicators show the largest deviation from isolated disks during strong interaction phases. Based on a series of simulations with various initial disk orientations, orbital parameters, gas fractions, and mass ratios, we find that the merger signatures are visible for ~0.2-0.4 Gyr with kinematic merger indicators but can be approximately twice as long for equal-mass mergers of massive gas-rich disk galaxies designed to be analogs of z~2-3 submillimeter galaxies. Merger signatures are most apparent after the second passage and before the black holes coalescence, but in some cases they persist up to several hundred Myr after coalescence. About 20-60% of the simulated galaxies are not identified as mergers during the strong interaction phase, implying that galaxies undergoing violent merging process do not necessarily exhibit highly asymmetric kinematics in their star-forming gas. The lack of identifiable merger signatures in this population can lead to an underestimation of merger abundances in star-forming galaxies, and including them in samples of star-forming disks may bias the measurements of disk properties such as intrinsic velocity dispersion.",1
53847,0,"Estimating the Galactic Mass Profile in the Presence of Incomplete Data A powerful method to measure the mass profile of a galaxy is through the velocities of tracer particles distributed through its halo. Transforming this kind of data accurately to a mass profile M(r), however, is not a trivial problem. In particular, limited or incomplete data may substantially affect the analysis. In this paper we develop a Bayesian method to deal with incomplete data effectively; we have a hybrid-Gibbs sampler that treats the unknown velocity components of tracers as parameters in the model. We explore the effectiveness of our model using simulated data, and then apply our method to the Milky Way using velocity and position data from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. We find that in general, missing velocity components have little effect on the total mass estimate. However, the results are quite sensitive to the outer globular cluster Pal 3. Using a basic Hernquist model with an isotropic velocity dispersion, we obtain credible regions for the cumulative mass profile M(r) of the Milky Way, and provide estimates for the model parameters with 95 percent Bayesian credible intervals. The mass contained within 260 kpc is 1.37x10^12 solar masses, with a 95 percent credible interval of (1.27,1.51)x10^12 solar masses. The Hernquist parameters for the total mass and scale radius are 1.55 (+0.18/-0.13)x10^12 solar masses and 16.9 (+4.8/-4.1) kpc, where the uncertainties span the 95 percent credible intervals.

53940,0,"Explosion of white dwarfs harboring hybrid CONe cores Recently, it has been found that off-centre carbon burning in a subset of intermediate-mass stars does not propagate all the way to the center, resulting in a class of hybrid CONe cores. Here, we consider the possibility that stars hosting these hybrid CONe cores might belong to a close binary system and, eventually, become white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion at rates leading to a supernova explosion. We have computed the hydrodynamical phase of the explosion of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs harboring hybrid cores, assuming that the explosion starts at the center, either as a detonation (as may be expected in some degenerate merging scenarios) or as a deflagration (that afterwards transitions into a delayed detonation). We assume these hybrid cores are made of a central CO volume, of mass M(CO), surrounded by an ONe shell. We show that, in case of a pure detonation, a medium-sized CO-rich region, M(CO)&lt;0.4 Msun, results in the ejection of a small fraction of the mantle while leaving a massive bound remnant. Part of this remnant is made of the products of the detonation, Fe-group nuclei, but they are buried in its inner regions, unless convection is activated during the ensuing cooling and shrinking phase of the remnant. In contrast, and somehow paradoxically, delayed detonations do not leave remnants but for the minimum M(CO) we have explored, M(CO)=0.2 Msun, and even in this case the remnant is as small as 0.13 Msun. The ejecta produced by these delayed detonations are characterized by slightly smaller masses of 56Ni and substantially smaller kinetic energies than obtained for a delayed detonation of a 'normal' CO white dwarf. The optical emission expected from these explosions would hardly match the observational properties of typical Type Ia supernovae, although they make interesting candidates for the subluminous class of SN2002cx-like or SNIax.",1
54043,0,"Event-Driven Monte Carlo: exact dynamics at all time-scales for discrete-variable models We present an algorithm for the simulation of the exact real-time dynamics of classical many-body systems with discrete energy levels. In the same spirit of kinetic Monte Carlo methods, a stochastic solution of the master equation is found, with no need to define any other phase-space construction. However, unlike existing methods, the present algorithm does not assume any particular statistical distribution to perform moves or to advance the time, and thus is a unique tool for the numerical exploration of fast and ultra-fast dynamical regimes. By decomposing the problem in a set of two-level subsystems, we find a natural variable step size, that is well defined from the normalization condition of the transition probabilities between the levels. We successfully test the algorithm with known exact solutions for non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamical properties of Ising-spin models in one and two dimensions, and compare to standard implementations of kinetic Monte Carlo methods. The present algorithm is directly applicable to the study of the real time dynamics of a large class of classical markovian chains, and particularly to short-time situations where the exact evolution is relevant.",1
54075,0,"Separability criteria with angular and Hilbert space averages The practically useful criteria of separable states $\rho=\sum_{k}w_{k}\rho_{k}$ in $d=2\times2$ are discussed.

We propose the separability criteria of mixed states, which are given by ${\rm Tr}\rho\{{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes {\bf b}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\}=(1/3)C\cos\varphi$ for two spin $1/2$ systems and $4{\rm Tr}\rho \{P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf b})\}=1+(1/2)C\cos2\varphi$ for two photon systems, respectively, after taking a geometrical angular average of ${\bf a}$ and ${\bf b}$ with fixed $\cos\varphi={\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}$. Here $-1\leq C\leq 1$, and the difference in the numerical coefficients $1/2$ and $1/3$ arises from the different rotational properties of the spinor and the transverse photon. If one instead takes an average over the states in the $d=2$ Hilbert space, the criterion for two photon systems is replaced by $4{\rm Tr}\rho \{P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf b})\}=1+(1/3)C\cos2\varphi$. Those separability criteria are shown to be very efficient using the existing experimental data of Aspect et al. in 1981 and Sakai et al. in 2006.

In particular, we first classify and distinguish all possible superfluid phases by the momentum-space topology of their zero-energy quasiparticle/quasihole excitations, and then numerically establish a plethora of quantum phase transitions in between. These transitions are further signalled and evidenced by the changes in the corresponding topological invariant of the system, \textit{i.e.}, its Chern number.

54117,0,"Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory for higher order dynamical systems The Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory represents a powerful mathematical method for the investigation of the properties of dynamical systems. The KCC theory introduces a geometric description of the time evolution of a dynamical system, with the solution curves of the dynamical system described by methods inspired by the theory of geodesics in a Finsler spaces. The evolution of a dynamical system is geometrized by introducing a non-linear connection, which allows the construction of the KCC covariant derivative, and of the deviation curvature tensor. In the KCC theory the properties of any dynamical system are described in terms of five geometrical invariants, with the second one giving the Jacobi stability of the system. Usually, the KCC theory is formulated by reducing the dynamical evolution equations to a set of second order differential equations. In the present paper we introduce and develop the KCC approach for dynamical systems described by systems of arbitrary $n$-dimensional first order differential equations. We investigate in detail the properties of the $n$-dimensional autonomous dynamical systems, as well as the relationship between the linear stability and the Jacobi stability. As a main result we find that only even-dimensional dynamical systems can exhibit both Jacobi stability and instability behaviors, while odd-dimensional dynamical systems are always Jacobi unstable, no matter their Lyapunov stability.

We demonstrate for a particle undergoing free diffusion that precision is negligibly affected by motion blur in typical experiments, while optimizing photon counts and the number of recorded frames is the key to precision. Building on these results, we describe for a wide range of experimental scenarios how to choose experimental parameters in order to optimize the precision. Generally, one should choose quantity over quality: experiments should be designed to maximize the number of frames recorded in a time-series, even if this means lower information content in individual frames.",1

This gives us a degree of analytic control not possible in generic lattice models, and we are able to obtain analytic expressions for the relevant geometric criteria. These may be differentiated by whether they converge exponentially or polynomially to the continuum limit. We demonstrate that the latter criteria have a dominant effect on the physics of interacting particles in Hofstadter bands in this low flux density regime. In particular, we show that the many-body gap depends monotonically on a band-geometric criterion related to the trace of the Fubini-Study metric.",1

At the heart of the Langlands Programme is the concept of an L-function. The most famous L-function is the Riemann zeta-function, and as well as being ubiquitous in number theory itself, L-functions have applications in mathematical physics and cryptography. Two of the seven Clay Mathematics Million Dollar Millennium Problems, the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, deal with their properties. Many different mathematical objects are connected in various ways to L-functions, but the study of those objects is highly specialized, and most mathematicians have only a vague idea of the objects outside their specialty and how everything is related. Helping mathematicians to understand these connections was the motivation for the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB) project. Its mission is to chart the landscape of L-functions and modular forms in a systematic, comprehensive and concrete fashion. This involves developing their theory, creating and improving algorithms for computing and classifying them, and hence discovering new properties of these functions, and testing fundamental conjectures.

In this paper, we show how U(1)-symmetry can be combined with the previously proposed anyonic Matrix Product States to simulate ground states and dynamics of anyonic systems on a lattice at any rational particle number density. We provide proof of principle by studying itinerant anyons on a one dimensional chain where no natural notion of braiding arises and also on a two-leg ladder where the anyons hop between sites and possibly braid. We compare the result of the ground state energies of Fibonacci anyons against hardcore bosons and spinless fermions. In addition, we report the entanglement entropies of the ground states of interacting Fibonacci anyons on a fully filled two-leg ladder at different interaction strength, identifying gapped or gapless points in the parameter space. As an outlook, our approach can also prove useful in studying the time dynamics of a finite number of nonabelian anyons on a finite two-dimensional lattice.",1

The experiments show that, by measuring the correlation function of intensity fluctuations between two light fields, a three-dimensional map at about 1.0 km range with 25 cm resolution in lateral direction and 60 cm resolution in axial direction has been achieved by time-resolved measurements of the reflection signals.",1
55028,0,"Galaxy structure from multiple tracers: II. M87 from parsec to megaparsec scales Following a number of conflicting studies of M87's mass profile, we undertake a dynamical analysis of multiple tracer populations to constrain its mass over a large radius range. We combine stellar kinematics in the central regions with the dynamics of 612 globular clusters out to 200 kpc and satellite galaxies extending to scales comparable with the virial radius. Using a spherical Jeans analysis, we are able to disentangle the mass contributions from the dark and baryonic components and set constraints on the structure of each. Assuming isotropy, we explore four different models for the dark matter halo and find that a centrally-cored dark matter distribution is preferred. We infer a stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_{\star,v} = 6.9 \pm 0.1$ -- consistent with a Salpeter-like IMF -- and a core radius $r_c = 67 \pm 20$ kpc. We then introduce anisotropy and find that, while the halo remains clearly cored, the radial stellar anisotropy has a strong impact on both $\Upsilon_{\star,v}$ and the core's radius; here we find $\Upsilon_{\star,v} = 3.50_{-0.36}^{+0.32}$ -- consistent with a Chabrier-like IMF -- and $r_c = 19.00_{-8.34}^{+8.38}$ kpc. Thus the presence of a core at the centre of the dark halo is robust against anisotropy assumptions, while the stellar mass and core size are not. We are able to reconcile previously discrepant studies by showing that modelling the globular cluster data alone leads to the very different inference of a super-NFW cusp, thus highlighting the value of multiple-population modelling, and we point to the possible role of M87's AGN and the cluster environment in forming the central dark matter core.",1

Our work deals with the design of hybrid active filter to reduce current perturbations produced by power electronics based devices. The Instantaneous Active and Reactive Power Method (pq) is used to perform the identification of disturbing currents.

55106,0,InnoPOL: an EMCCD imaging polarimeter and 85-element curvature AO system on the 3.6-m AEOS telescope for cost effective polarimetric speckle suppression The Hokupa'a-85 curvature adaptive optics system components have been adapted to create a new AO-corrected coud\'{e} instrument at the 3.67m Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) telescope. This new AO-corrected optical path is designed to deliver an f/40 diffraction-limited focus at wavelengths longer than 800nm. A new EMCCD-based dual-beam imaging polarimeter called InnoPOL has been designed and is presently being installed behind this corrected f/40 beam. The InnoPOL system is a flexible platform for optimizing polarimetric performance using commercial solutions and for testing modulation strategies. The system is designed as a technology test and demonstration platform as the coud\'{e} path is built using off-the-shelf components wherever possible. Models of the polarimetric performance after AO correction show that polarization modulation at rates as slow as 200Hz can cause speckle correlations in brightness and focal plane location sufficient enough to change the speckle suppression behavior of the modulators. These models are also verified by initial EMCCD scoring camera data at AEOS. Substantial instrument trades and development efforts are explored between instrument performance parameters and various polarimetric noise sources.,1
55124,0,"Rest-frame UV single-epoch black hole mass estimates of low-luminosity AGN at intermediate redshifts The ability to accurately derive black hole (BH) masses at progressively higher redshifts and over a wide range of continuum luminosities has become indispensable in the era of large-area extragalactic spectroscopic surveys. In this paper we present an extension of existing comparisons between rest-frame UV and optical virial BH mass estimators to intermediate redshifts and luminosities comparable to the local H$\beta$ reverberation mapped active galactic nuclei (AGN). We focus on the MgII, CIV, and CIII] broad emission lines and compare them to both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. We use newly acquired near-infrared spectra from the FMOS instrument on the Subaru telescope for 89 broad-lined AGN at redshifts between 0.3 and 3.5, complemented by data from the AGES survey. We employ two different prescriptions for measuring the emission line widths and compare the results. We confirm that MgII shows a tight correlation with H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, with a scatter of ~0.25 dex. The CIV and CIII] estimators, while showing larger scatter, are viable virial mass estimators after accounting for a trend with the UV-to-optical luminosity ratio. We find an intrinsic scatter of ~0.37 dex between Balmer and carbon virial estimators by combining our dataset with previous high redshift measurements. This updated comparison spans a total of 3 decades in BH mass. We calculate a virial factor for CIV/CIII] logf(CIV/CIII])=0.87 with an estimated systematic uncertainty of ~0.4 dex and find excellent agreement between the local reverberation mapped AGN sample and our high-z sample.",1
55165,0,"Study of the photon-induced formation and subsequent desorption of CH3 OH and H2 CO in interstellar ice analogs Methanol and formaldehyde are two simple organic molecules that are ubiquitously detected in the interstellar medium. An origin in the solid phase and a subsequent nonthermal desorption into the gas phase is often invoked to explain their abundances in some of the environments where they are found. Experimental simulations under astrophysically relevant conditions have been carried out to find a suitable mechanism for that process. We explore the in situ formation and subsequent photon-induced desorption of these species, studying the UV photoprocessing of pure ethanol ice, and a more realistic binary H2O:CH4 ice analog. Ice samples deposited onto an infrared transparent window at 8 K were UV-irradiated using a microwave-discharged hydrogen flow lamp. Evidence of photochemical production of these two species and subsequent UV-photon-induced desorption into the gas phase were searched for by means of a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and a quadrupole mass spectrometer, respectively. Formation of CH3OH was only observed during photoprocessing of the H2O:CH4 ice analog, but no photon-induced desorption was detected. Photochemical production of H2CO was observed in both series of experiments. Photochemidesorption of formaldehyde, i.e., photon-induced formation on the ice surface and inmediate desorption, was observed, with a yield of 4.4 x 10-4 (molecules/incident photon) when the H2O:CH4 ice analogs were photoprocessed. While certain C-bearing species, in particular H2CO, were found to desorb upon irradiation, nonthermal desorption of CH3OH was not observed. So far, there is no experimental evidence of any efficient CH3 OH desorption induced by UV photons.",1
55185,0,"Sizes, Colour gradients and Resolved Stellar Mass Distributions for the Massive Cluster Galaxies in XMMUJ2235-2557 at z = 1.39 We analyse the sizes, colour gradients, and resolved stellar mass distributions for 36 massive and passive galaxies in the cluster XMMUJ2235-2557 at z=1.39 using optical and near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We derive light-weighted S\'ersic fits in five HST bands ($i_{775},z_{850},Y_{105},J_{125},H_{160}$), and find that the size decreases by ~20% going from $i_{775}$ to $H_{160}$ band, consistent with recent studies. We then generate spatially resolved stellar mass maps using an empirical relationship between $M_{*}/L_{H_{160}}$ and $(z_{850}-H_{160})$ and use these to derive mass-weighted S\'ersic fits: the mass-weighted sizes are ~41% smaller than their rest-frame $r$-band counterparts compared with an average of ~12% at z~0. We attribute this evolution to the evolution in the $M_{*}/L_{H_{160}}$ and colour gradient. Indeed, as expected, the ratio of mass-weighted to light-weighted size is correlated with the $M_{*}/L$ gradient, but is also mildly correlated with the mass surface density and mass-weighted size. The colour gradients $(\nabla_{z-H})$ are mostly negative, with a median value of $\sim0.45$ mag dex$^{-1}$, twice the local value. The evolution is caused by an evolution in age gradients along the semi-major axis ($a$), with $\nabla_{age} = d \log(age) / d \log(a)$ $\sim-0.33$, while the survival of weaker colour gradients in old, local galaxies implies that metallicity gradients are also required, with $\nabla_{Z} = d \log(Z) / d \log(a)$ $\sim-0.2$. This is consistent with recent observational evidence for the inside-out growth of passive galaxies at high redshift, and favours a gradual mass growth mechanism, such as minor mergers.",1

55381,0,"Supermassive black holes and their host spheroids III. The $M_{BH} - n_{sph}$ correlation The S\'ersic $R^{1/n}$ model is the best approximation known to date for describing the light distribution of stellar spheroidal and disk components, with the S\'ersic index $n$ providing a direct measure of the central radial concentration of stars. The S\'ersic index of a galaxy's spheroidal component, $n_{sph}$, has been shown to tightly correlate with the mass of the central supermassive black hole, $M_{BH}$. The $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ correlation is also expected from other two well known scaling relations involving the spheroid luminosity, $L_{sph}$: the $L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and the $M_{BH}-L_{sph}$. Obtaining an accurate estimate of the spheroid S\'ersic index requires a careful modelling of a galaxy's light distribution and some studies have failed to recover a statistically significant $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ correlation. With the aim of re-investigating the $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ and other black hole mass scaling relations, we performed a detailed (i.e.~bulge, disks, bars, spiral arms, rings, halo, nucleus, etc.) decomposition of 66 galaxies, with directly measured black hole masses, that had been imaged at $3.6\rm~\mu m$ with Spitzer. In this paper, the third of this series, we present an analysis of the $L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ diagrams. While early-type (elliptical+lenticular) and late-type (spiral) galaxies split into two separate relations in the $L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and $M_{BH}-L_{sph}$ diagrams, they reunite into a single $M_{BH} \propto n_{sph}^{3.39 \pm 0.15}$ sequence with relatively small intrinsic scatter ($\epsilon \simeq 0.25 \rm~dex$). The black hole mass appears to be closely related to the spheroid central concentration of stars, which mirrors the inner gradient of the spheroid gravitational potential.",1

55462,0,"Toward an asymptotic behaviour of the ABC dynamo The ABC flow was originally introduced by Arnol'd to investigate Lagrangian chaos. It soon became the prototype example to illustrate magnetic-field amplification via fast dynamo action, i.e. dynamo action exhibiting magnetic-field amplification on a typical timescale independent of the electrical resistivity of the medium. Even though this flow is the most classical example for this important class of dynamos (with application to large-scale astrophysical objects), it was recently pointed out (Bouya Isma\""el and Dormy Emmanuel, Phys. Fluids, 25 (2013) 037103) that the fast dynamo nature of this flow was unclear, as the growth rate still depended on the magnetic Reynolds number at the largest values available so far $(\text{Rm} = 25000)$ . Using state-of-the-art high-performance computing, we present high-resolution simulations (up to 40963) and extend the value of $\text{Rm}$ up to $ 5\cdot10^5$ . Interestingly, even at these huge values, the growth rate of the leading eigenmode still depends on the controlling parameter and an asymptotic regime is not reached yet. We show that the maximum growth rate is a decreasing function of $\text{Rm}$ for the largest values of $\text{Rm}$ we could achieve (as anticipated in the above-mentioned paper). Slowly damped oscillations might indicate either a new mode crossing or that the system is approaching the limit of an essential spectrum.",1

The prepared electrode exhibited considerable increase in electroactivity of the sensor toward this herbicide compared to the non-imprinted electrode. To enhance the detection capability of the prepared system, the factors controlling its response were investigated and optimized using differential pulse voltammetry. The proposed analytical procedure was proved to be applicable in the concentration range of 5 to 50 {\mu}M (R^2 = 0.9939) and detection limit of (3{\sigma}) 0.22 {\mu}M. Ultimately, the proposed analytical methodology was applied to ascertain possible interferences and investigate real samples of dam water.

55538,0,"An extremely fast halo hot subdwarf star in a wide binary system New spectroscopic observations of the halo hyper-velocity star candidate SDSS J121150.27+143716.2 ($V=17.92$ mag) revealed a cool companion to the hot subdwarf primary. The components have a very similar radial velocity and their absolute luminosities are consistent with the same distance, confirming the physical nature of the binary, which is the first double-lined hyper-velocity candidate. Our spectral decomposition of the Keck/ESI spectrum provided an sdB+K3V pair, analogous to many long-period subdwarf binaries observed in the Galactic disk. We found the subdwarf atmospheric parameters: $T_{\rm eff}=30\,600\pm500$ K, $\log{g}=5.57\pm0.06$ cm s$^{-2}$ and He abundance $\log(n{\rm He}/n{\rm H})=-3.0\pm0.2$. Oxygen is the most abundant metal in the hot subdwarf atmosphere, and Mg and Na lines are the most prominent spectral features of the cool companion, consistent with a metallicity of $[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]=-1.3$. The non-detection of radial velocity variations suggest the orbital period to be a few hundred days, in agreement with similar binaries observed in the disk. Using the SDSS-III flux calibrated spectrum we measured the distance to the system $d=5.5\pm0.5$ kpc, which is consistent with ultraviolet, optical, and infrared photometric constraints derived from binary spectral energy distributions. Our kinematic study shows that the Galactic rest-frame velocity of the system is so high that an unbound orbit cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, a bound orbit requires a massive dark matter halo. We conclude that the binary either formed in the halo or it was accreted from the tidal debris of a dwarf galaxy by the Milky Way.",1

55582,0,"The Lyman Continuum Escape Fraction of Low-Mass Star-Forming Galaxies at z~1 To date no direct detection of Lyman continuum emission has been measured for intermediate--redshift z~1 star-forming galaxies . We combine HST grism spectroscopy with GALEX UV and ground--based optical imaging to extend the search for escaping Lyman continuum to a large (~600) sample of z~1 low-mass, moderately star-forming galaxies selected initially on H$\alpha$ emission. The characteristic escape fraction of LyC from SFGs that populate this parameter space remains weakly constrained by previous surveys, but these faint SFGs are assumed to play a significant role in the reionization of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift (z&gt;6). We do not make an unambiguous detection of escaping LyC radiation from this $z\sim1$ sample, individual non--detections to constrain the absolute Lyman continuum escape fraction, $f_{esc}$&lt;2.1% (3$\sigma$). We measure upper limits of $f_{esc}$&lt;9.6% from a sample of SFGs selected on high H$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW&gt;200\AA), which are thought to be close analogs of high redshift sources of reionization. For reference, we also present an emissivity--weighted escape fraction which is useful as a measurement of the general contribution of the SFGs to the z~1 ionizing UV background. In the discussion, we consider the implications of these intermediate redshift constraints for the reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at high (z &gt; 6) redshift.

We examine several $J=2\leftarrow{}1$ and $1\leftarrow{}0$ hyperfine-resolved rotational transitions for both conformers. The transitions are fit to a rigid rotor Hamiltonian including nuclear quadrupole coupling to account for the nitrogen nucleus. For cis-3-aminophenol we obtain rotational constants of A=3734.930 MHz, B=1823.2095 MHz, and C=1226.493 MHz, for trans-3-aminophenol of A=3730.1676 MHz, B=1828.25774 MHz, and C=1228.1948 MHz.

The large incidence angle and constant ponderomotive pressure leads to nano-bunching of relativistic electrons responsible for the laser-driven synchrotron emission. A numerical method is developed to find the source and direction of the coherent radiation that is responsible for the existence of attopulses.

55838,0,"Deformation of a quantum many-particle system by a rotating impurity During the last 70 years, the quantum theory of angular momentum has been successfully applied to describing the properties of nuclei, atoms, and molecules, their interactions with each other as well as with external fields. Due to the properties of quantum rotations, the angular momentum algebra can be of tremendous complexity even for a few interacting particles, such as valence electrons of an atom, not to mention larger many-particle systems. In this work, we study an example of the latter: a rotating quantum impurity coupled to a many-body bosonic bath. In the regime of strong impurity-bath couplings the problem involves addition of an infinite number of angular momenta which renders it intractable using currently available techniques. Here, we introduce a novel canonical transformation which allows to eliminate the complex angular momentum algebra from such a class of many-body problems. In addition, the transformation exposes the problem's constants of motion, and renders it solvable exactly in the limit of a slowly-rotating impurity. We exemplify the technique by showing that there exists a critical rotational speed at which the impurity suddenly acquires one quantum of angular momentum from the many-particle bath. Such an instability is accompanied by the deformation of the phonon density in the frame rotating along with the impurity.",1

Particular interest was given to the losses found in tapes in the superconducting rotor caused by the magnetic flux ripples originating from the conventional stator during nominal operation. To compute the losses, a 2D Finite Element Method was applied to solve the H-formulation of Maxwell's equations considering the nonlinear properties of both the superconducting material and its surrounding Ni matrix. To be able to model all the different turns composing the winding of the superconducting rotor coils, three geometrical models of single tape cross section of decreasing complexity were studied: 1) the first model reproduced closely the actual cross section obtained from micrographs, 2) the second model was obtained from the computed elastoplastic deformation of a round Ni wire, 3) the last model was based on a simplified elliptic cross section. The last geometry allowed validating the modeling technique by comparing numerical losses with results from well-established analytical expressions. Additionally, the following cases of filament transpositions were studied: no, partial and full transposition.

56720,0,"Synthesis of multi-wavelength temporal phase-shifting algorithms optimized for high signal-to-noise ratio and high detuning robustness using the frequency transfer function Synthesis of single-wavelength temporal phase-shifting algorithms (PSA) for interferometry is well-known and firmly based on the frequency transfer function (FTF) paradigm. Here we extend the single-wavelength FTF-theory to dual and multi-wavelength PSA-synthesis when several simultaneous laser-colors are present. The FTF-based synthesis for dual-wavelength PSA (DW-PSA) is optimized for high signal-to-noise ratio and minimum number of temporal phase-shifted interferograms. The DW-PSA synthesis herein presented may be used for interferometric contouring of discontinuous industrial objects. Also DW-PSA may be useful for DW shop-testing of deep free-form aspheres. As shown here, using the FTF-based synthesis one may easily find explicit DW-PSA formulae optimized for high signal-to-noise and high detuning robustness. To this date, no general synthesis and analysis for temporal DW-PSAs has been given; only had-hoc DW-PSAs formulas have been reported. Consequently, no explicit formulae for their spectra, their signal-to-noise, their detuning and harmonic robustness has been given. Here for the first time a fully general procedure for designing DW-PSAs (or triple-wavelengths PSAs) with desire spectrum, signal-to-noise ratio and detuning robustness is given. We finally generalize DW-PSA to higher number of wavelength temporal PSAs.",1

We find a maximally entangled W-state in the ensemble part of the system for a certain coupling parameters region. The area of this region decreases as the ensemble size increases and, in the classical limit, becomes the line in parameter space that defines the phase transition of the system. In the classical limit, we also study the dynamics of the system and its transition from order to disorder for initial energies close to the ground state energy. We find that a critical energy providing this transition is related to the minimum of the projection of the total angular momentum of the quantum system in the $z$-direction.",1

56975,0,"Characteristic properties of the Casimir free energy for metal films deposited on metallic plates The Casimir free energy and pressure of thin metal films deposited on metallic plates are considered using the Lifshitz theory and the Drude and plasma model approaches to the role of conduction electrons. The bound electrons are taken into account by using the complete optical data of film and plate metals. It is shown that for films of several tens of nanometers thickness the Casimir free energy and pressure calculated using these approaches differ by hundreds and thousands percent and can be easily discriminated experimentally. According to our results, the free energy of a metal film does not vanish in the limiting case of ideal metal if the Drude model approach is used in contradiction with the fact that the fluctuating field cannot penetrate in its interior. Numerical computations of the Casimir free energy and pressure of Ag and Au films deposited on Cu and Al plates have been performed using both theoretical approaches. It is shown that the free energy of a film can be both negative and positive depending on the metals used. For a Au film on a Ag plate and vice versa the Casimir energy of a film changes its sign with increasing film thickness. Applications of the obtained results for resolving the Casimir puzzle and the problem of stability of thin films are discussed.",1
57018,0,"Target-skyrmions and skyrmion clusters in nanowires of chiral magnets In bulk non-centrosymmetric magnets the chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange stabilizes tubular skyrmions with a reversed magnetization in their centers. While the double-twist is favorable in the center of a skyrmion, it gives rise to an excess of the energy density at the outskirt. Therefore, magnetic anisotropies are required to make skyrmions more favorable than the conical spiral state in bulk materials. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that in magnetic nanowires unusual skyrmions with a doubly twisted core and a number of concentric helicoidal undulations (target-skyrmions) are thermodynamically stable even in absence of single-ion anisotropies. Such skyrmions are free of magnetic charges and, since the angle describing the direction of magnetization at the surface depends on the radius of the nanowire and an applied magnetic field, they carry a non-integer skyrmion charge s &gt; 1. This state competes with clusters of spatially separated s=1 skyrmions. For very small radii, the target-skyrmion transforms into a skyrmion with s &lt; 1, that resembles the vortex-like state stabilized by surface-induced anisotropies.",1

It is also attractive for scientists, because they do not have to care any more for their own IT infrastructure, but can outsource it to a Cloud Service Provider of their choice. However, for the case of High-Performance Computing (HPC) in a cloud, as it is needed in simulations or for Big Data analysis, things are getting more intricate, because HPC codes must stay highly efficient, even when executed by many virtual cores (vCPUs). Older clouds or new standard clouds can fulfil this only under special precautions, which are given in this article. The results can be extrapolated to other cloud OSes than OpenStack and to other codes than OpenFOAM, which were used as examples.",1
57185,0,"High performance Python for direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equations is an invaluable research tool in fluid dynamics. Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral DNS code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.",1

We review theoretical work on negative and positive active galactic nuclei feedback, discussing insights gained from recent hydrodynamical simulations of jet-driven feedback on galaxy scales that are applicable to compact radio sources. The simulations show that the efficiency of feedback and the relative importance of negative and positive feedback depends strongly on interstellar medium properties, especially the column depth and spatial distribution of clouds. Negative feedback is most effective if clouds are distributed spherically and individual clouds have small column depths, while positive feedback is most effective if clouds are predominantly in a disc-like configuration.",1
57321,0,"Probing topological protection using a designer surface plasmon structure Topological photonic states, inspired by robust chiral edge states in topological insulators, have recently been demonstrated in a few photonic systems, including an array of coupled on-chip ring resonators at communication wavelengths. However, the intrinsic difference between electrons and photons determines that the topological protection in time-reversal-invariant photonic systems does not share the same robustness as its counterpart in electronic topological insulators. Here, in a designer surface plasmon platform consisting of tunable metallic sub-wavelength structures, we construct photonic topological edge states and probe their robustness against a variety of defect classes, including some common time-reversal-invariant photonic defects that can break the topological protection, but do not exist in electronic topological insulators. This is also the first experimental realization of anomalous Floquet topological edge states, whose topological phase cannot be predicted by the usual Chern number topological invariants.",1
57328,0,"Intrinsic torsion in quaternionic contact geometry We investigate quaternionic contact (qc) manifolds from the point of view of intrinsic torsion. We argue that the natural structure group for this geometry is a non-compact Lie group K containing Sp(n)H^*, and show that any qc structure gives rise to a canonical K-structure with constant intrinsic torsion, except in seven dimensions, when this condition is equivalent to integrability in the sense of Duchemin. We prove that the choice of a reduction to Sp(n)H^* (or equivalently, a complement of the qc distribution) yields a unique K-connection satisfying natural conditions on torsion and curvature. We show that the choice of a compatible metric on the qc distribution determines a canonical reduction to Sp(n)Sp(1) and a canonical Sp(n)Sp(1)-connection whose curvature is almost entirely determined by its torsion. We show that its Ricci tensor, as well as the Ricci tensor of the Biquard connection, has an interpretation in terms of intrinsic torsion.",1
57387,0,"Control System Design for Tricopter using Filters and PID controller The purpose of this paper is to present the control system design of Tricopter. We have presented the implementation of control system in software in this paper. Tricopter's control system mainly consists of two parts Complimentary filter and PID block. The angles along X, Y and Z axis are taken from the complementary filter which acts as a feedback block. We have used the combination of gyroscope and accelerometer for finding the angle. We have also shown the role of the complimentary filter in finding out the angle along X, Y, and Z axis instead of using gyroscope and accelerometer directly. The second main part is the PID Controller which calculates the error in angle along X, Y and Z axis and produces an output signal which reduces error. We have shown the importance of the constant parameters of PID Controller. The results of this paper are tested on an actual Tricopter and also plotted in the form of graph using Matlab and Processing software.",1

With the increasing importance of interferometry in astronomy, the lack of educational interferometers is an obstacle to training the future generation of astronomers. This interferometer provides the hands-on experience needed to fully understand the basic concepts of interferometry. The design of this interferometer is based on the Michelson &amp; Pease stellar optical interferometer, but operates at a radio wavelength (~11 GHz; ~2.7cm); thus the requirement for optical accuracy is much less stringent. We utilize a commercial broadcast satellite dish and feedhorn. Two flat side mirrors slide on a ladder, providing baseline coverage. This interferometer resolves and measures the diameter of the Sun, a nice daytime experiment which can be carried out even in marginal weather (i.e., partial cloud cover). Commercial broadcast satellites provide convenient point sources for comparison to the Sun's extended disk.

We develop new techniques in treating the N-body Hamiltonian so that we overcome the difficulties generated by the attractive interaction and establish new energy estimates. We also prove the optimal 1D collapsing estimate which reduces the regularity requirement in the uniqueness argument by half a derivative.

57927,0,"Maintenance of Automated Test Suites in Industry: An Empirical study on Visual GUI Testing Context: Verification and validation (V&amp;V) activities make up 20 to 50 percent of the total development costs of a software system in practice. Test automation is proposed to lower these V&amp;V costs but available research only provides limited empirical data from industrial practice about the maintenance costs of automated tests and what factors affect these costs. In particular, these costs and factors are unknown for automated GUI-based testing. Objective: This paper addresses this lack of knowledge through analysis of the costs and factors associated with the maintenance of automated GUI-based tests in industrial practice. Method: An empirical study at two companies, Siemens and Saab, is reported where interviews about, and empirical work with, Visual GUI Testing is performed to acquire data about the technique's maintenance costs and feasibility. Results: 13 factors are observed that affect maintenance, e.g. tester knowledge/experience and test case complexity. Further, statistical analysis shows that developing new test scripts is costlier than maintenance but also that frequent maintenance is less costly than infrequent, big bang maintenance. In addition a cost model, based on previous work, is presented that estimates the time to positive return on investment (ROI) of test automation compared to manual testing. Conclusions: It is concluded that test automation can lower overall software development costs of a project whilst also having positive effects on software quality. However, maintenance costs can still be considerable and the less time a company currently spends on manual testing, the more time is required before positive, economic, ROI is reached after automation.",1

Analysis of multi-epoch Kitt Peak coud\'{e} feed spectra from this sightline taken over an eight-year period reveals significant variation in both the observed column density and the central velocities of the high-velocity gas components in these spectra. Given the $\sim$1.3 mas yr$^{-1}$ proper motion of HD 47240 and a SNR distance of 1.6 kpc, this variation would imply $\sim$10 AU fluctuations within the SNR shell. Similar variations have been previously reported in the Vela supernova remnant, suggesting a connection between the expanding supernova remnant gas and the observed variations. We speculate on the potential nature of the observed variations toward HD 47240 in the context of the expanding remnant gas interacting with the ambient ISM.",1

FTIR studies have shown the signatures of imide, CNC stretching, malemide and N-H stretching. These BMI polymer coatings were deposited on aluminum and mild steel substrates by sprinkling powers followed by baking. Thermo gravimetric analysis and Differential scanning calorimetric studies showed the degradation temperature of these polymers around 370oC. Aluminum coatings were deposited on BMI previously deposited on Al and mild steel to make a metal-BMI-metal trilayer.

Topological surface states with Fermi arcs are predicted on the surface and have been observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. Although the exotic transport properties of the bulk Dirac cones have been demonstrated, it is still a challenge to reveal the surface states via transport measurements due to the highly conductive bulk states. Here, we show Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in individual single-crystal Cd3As2 nanowires with low carrier concentration and large surface-to-volume ratio, providing transport evidence of the surface state in three-dimensional Dirac semimetals. Moreover, the quantum transport can be modulated by tuning the Fermi level using a gate voltage, enabling a deeper understanding of rich physics residing in Dirac semimetals.",1

58381,0,"Modelling stellar jets with magnetospheres using as initial states analytical MHD solutions In this paper we focus on the construction of stellar outflow models emerging from a polar coronal hole-type region surrounded by a magnetosphere in the equatorial regions during phases of quiescent accretion. The models are based on initial analytical solutions. We adopt a meridionally self-similar solution of the time-independent and axisymmetric MHD equations which describes effectively a jet originating from the corona of a star. We modify appropriately this solution in order to incorporate a physically consistent stellar magnetosphere. We find that the closed fieldline region may exhibit different behaviour depending on the associated boundary conditions and the distribution of the heat flux. However, the stellar jet in all final equilibrium states is very similar to the analytical one prescribed in the initial conditions. When the initial net heat flux is maintained, the magnetosphere takes the form of a dynamical helmet streamer with a quasi steady state slow magnetospheric wind. With no heat flux, a small dead zone forms around the equator, surrounded by a weak streamer, source of a low mass flux magnetospheric ejection. An equilibrium with no streamer and a helmet shaped dead zone is found when the coronal hole is larger and extends up to a reduced closed fieldline static zone. The study demonstrates the robustness of self-similar solutions and their ability to provide quasi-steady jet simulations with realistic boundaries and surrounded by equatorial magnetospheres.",1

58605,0,"Variable Transmission Voltage for Loss Minimization in Long Offshore Wind Farm AC Export Cables Connection of offshore wind farms to shore requires the use of submarine cables. In the case of long HVAC connections, the capacitive charging currents limit the transfer capability and lead to high losses. This paper shows that the losses can be substantially reduced by continuously adjusting the cable operating voltage according to the instantaneous wind farm power production.Calculations for a 320 MW windfarm connected to shore via a 200 km cable at 220 kV nominal voltage shows that an annual loss reduction of 9 percent is achievable by simply using a 15 percent tap changer voltage regulation on the two transformers. Allowing a larger voltage regulation range leads to further loss reduction (13 percent for 0.4-1.0 p.u. voltage range). If the windfarm has a low utilization factor, the loss reduction potential is demonstrated to be as high as 21 percent .

The background is parameterized by bosonic degrees of freedom. The variational fermion-boson Hilbert space is constructed to achieve high accuracy in one to three spatial dimensions with modest computational requirements. To characterize the ground-state properties of the Edwards model in the single-particle sector, we present exact numerical results for the polaron band dispersion, quasiparticle weight, Drude weight, mass enhancement, and the particle-boson correlations in a wide parameter regime. In the Edwards model, transport will be quasifree, diffusive or boson-assisted in the weakly fermion-boson coupled, fluctuation-dominated or strongly correlated regimes, respectively. Thereby correlated transport is not only assisted but also limited by the bosonic excitations. As a result, the Drude weight remains finite even in the limit of very small boson frequencies. For a strongly correlated background, closed loops are important, in any dimension, to generate a finite effective particle mass even when the free fermion has an infinite mass.",1
58647,0,"Is there any evidence that ionised outflows quench star formation in type 1 quasars at z&lt;1? The aim of this paper is to test the basic model of negative AGN feedback. According to this model, once the central black hole accretes at the Eddington limit and reaches a certain critical mass, AGN driven outflows blow out gas, suppressing star formation in the host galaxy and self-regulating black hole growth. We consider a sample of 224 quasars selected from the SDSS at z&lt;1 observed in the infrared band by Herschel. We evaluate the star formation rate in relation to several outflow signatures traced by the [OIII]4959,5007 and [OII]3726,3729 emission lines in about half of the sample with high quality spectra. Most of the quasars show asymmetric and broad wings in [OIII], which we interpret as outflow signatures. We separate the quasars in two groups, ``weakly'' and ``strongly'' outflowing, using three different criteria. When we compare the mean star formation rate in five redshift bins in the two groups, we find that the SFRs are comparable or slightly larger in the strongly outflowing quasars. We estimate the stellar mass from SED fitting and the quasars are distributed along the star formation main sequence, although with a large scatter. The scatter from this relation is uncorrelated with respect to the kinematic properties of the outflow. Moreover, for quasars dominated in the infrared by starburst or by AGN emission, we do not find any correlation between the star formation rate and the velocity of the outflow, a trend previously reported in the literature for pure starburst galaxies. We conclude that the basic AGN negative feedback scenario seems not to agree with our results. Although we use a large sample of quasars, we did not find any evidence that the star formation rate is suppressed in the presence of AGN driven outflows on large scale. A possibility is that feedback is effective over much longer timescales than those of single episodes of quasar activity.",1

58980,0,"The VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS). Environmental effects shaping the galaxy stellar mass function We exploit the first public data release of VIPERS to investigate environmental effects in galaxy evolution between $z\sim0.5$ and $0.9$. The large number of spectroscopic redshifts over an area of about $10\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. The accurate redshift measurements, with $\sigma_z = 0.00047(1+z_\mathrm{spec})$, allow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest- and highest-density environments, as defined in terms of spatial 3D density contrast. We estimate the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies residing in these two environments, and constrain its high-mass end with unprecedented precision. We find that the galaxy SMF in the densest regions has a different shape than that measured at low densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter (less negative) slope at $z&lt;0.8$. We normalise each SMF to the comoving volume occupied by the corresponding environment, and relate estimates from different redshift bins. We observe an evolution of the SMF of VIPERS galaxies in high densities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. We compare these results to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures. We discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellite galaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic and environmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, and therefore difficult to disentangle. The evolution of our low-density regions is well described by the formalism introduced by Peng et al.~(2010), and is consistent with the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internal physical processes. The same formalism could also describe the evolution of the SMF in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution from dry mergers is considered. [Abridged]",1

The results of this search are recorded in the Candidate Cluster and Protocluster Catalog (CCPC). The catalog contains 12 clusters that are highly significant overdensities ($\delta_{gal}&gt;7$), 6 of which are previously known. We also identify another 31 candidate protoclusters (including 4 previously identified structures) of lower overdensity. CCPC systems vary over a wide range of physical sizes and shapes, from small, compact groups to large, extended, and filamentary collections of galaxies. This variety persists over the range from $z=3.71$ to $z=2.74$. These structures exist as galaxy overdensities ($\delta_{gal}$) with a mean value of 2, similar to the values found for other protoclusters in the literature. The median number of galaxies for CCPC systems is 11. Virial mass estimates are large for these redshifts, with thirteen cases apparently having $M &gt; 10^{15}\, M_{\odot}$.

In this article, relationship between PS with atomic numbers, sample thickness, and spherical aberration coefficients will be studied in both negative Cs imaging (NCSI) and positive Cs imaging (PCSI) modes by means of dynamical image simulation. Through comparing the peak width with different thickness and different values of spherical aberration, NCSI mode is found to be superior to PCSI considering smaller peak width in the structural image.",1
59150,0,"Existence of zero-energy impurity states in different classes of topological insulators and superconductors and their relation to topological phase transitions We consider the effects of impurities on topological insulators and superconductors. We start by identifying the general conditions under which the eigenenergies of an arbitrary Hamiltonian H belonging to one of the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes undergo a robust zero energy crossing as a function of an external parameter which can be, for example, the impurity strength. We define a generalized root of \det H, and use it to predict or rule out robust zero-energy crossings in all symmetry classes. We complement this result with an analysis based on almost degenerate perturbation theory, which allows a derivation of the asymptotic low-energy behavior of the ensemble averaged density of states $\rho \sim E^\alpha$ for all symmetry classes, and makes it transparent that the exponent \alpha\ does not depend on the choice of the random matrix ensemble. Finally, we show that a lattice of impurities can drive a topologically trivial system into a nontrivial phase, and in particular we demonstrate that impurity bands carrying extremely large Chern numbers can appear in different symmetry classes of two-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors. We use the generalized root of \det H(k) to reveal a spiderweblike momentum space structure of the energy gap closings that separate the topologically distinct phases in p_x + i p_y superconductors in the presence of an impurity lattice.",1

Among various proposals there is one based on radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices (rf-SQUIDs), in which the appearance of 4$\pi$-period energy-phase relations is regarded as smoking-gun evidence of Majorana fermion states. Here we report the observation of truncated 4$\pi$-period (i.e., 2$\pi$-period but fully skewed) oscillatory patterns of contact resistance on rf-SQUIDs constructed on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$. The results reveal the existence of 1/2 fractional modes of Cooper pairs and the occurrence of parity switchings, both of which are necessary signatures accompanied with the formation of Majorana fermion states.",1

While the correct answer can be obtained in principle by solving the Schrodinger equation of particle and detectors together, a more practical answer should involve a simple rule representing the behavior of idealized detectors. We have argued elsewhere [http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03715] that the most natural rule for this purpose is the ""absorbing boundary rule,"" based on the 1-particle Schrodinger equation with a certain ""absorbing"" boundary condition, first considered by Werner in 1987, at the ideal detecting surface. Here we develop a relativistic variant of this rule using the Dirac equation and also a boundary condition. We treat one or several detectable particles, in flat or curved space-time, with stationary or moving detectors.",1

Hermitian random matrix ensembles, under the eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition give rise to the joint probability density functions of N random variables. We show that if f(.) is a polynomial of degree K, then the variance of trf(M), is of the form,sum[n=1 to K] n(d[n])square, and d[n] is related to the expansion coefficients c[n] of the polynomial f(x) =sum[n=0 to K] c[n] b Pn(x), where Pn(x) are polynomials of degree n, orthogonal with respect to the weights 1/[(b-x)(x-a)]^(1/2), [(b -x)(x -a)]^(1/2), [(b-x)(x-a)]^(1/2)/x; (0 &lt; a &lt; x &lt; b), [(b-x)(x-a)]^(1/2)/[x(1-x)] ; (0 &lt; a &lt; x &lt; b &lt; 1), respectively.",1

59402,0,"Direct Statistical Simulation of a Jet We review progress that has been made in utilizing one form of Direct Statistical Simulation (DSS) to describe geophysical and astrophysical flows that are anisotropic and inhomogeneous. We first explain the approach, which is based upon a systematic and conservative expansion of the equations of motion for low-order equal-time cumulants. We place the method into context with other statistical procedures. Truncation at second order in the hierarchy of cumulants is equivalent to retaining the interaction between zonal mean flows and eddies. Eddy-eddy interactions appear at higher orders, but care must be taken to keep the higher-order expansions realizable with non-negative probability distribution functions. The strengths and weaknesses of different levels of approximation are assessed with numerical experiments on the fiducial problem of a stochastically forced jet on a spherical surface. The results give an insight into the mechanisms that may control jet spacing and strength, and indicate interesting avenues for future research.",1
59497,0,"Fast, label-free tracking of single viruses and weakly scattering nanoparticles in a nano-fluidic optical fiber High-speed tracking of single particles is a gateway to understanding physical, chemical, and biological processes at the nanoscale. It is also a major experimental challenge, particularly for small, nanometer-scale particles. Although methods such as confocal or fluorescence microscopy offer both high spatial resolution and high signal-to-background ratios, the fluorescence emission lifetime limits the measurement speed, while photobleaching and thermal diffusion limit the duration of measurements. Here we present a tracking method based on elastic light scattering that enables long-duration measurements of nanoparticle dynamics at rates of thousands of frames per second. We contain the particles within a single-mode silica fiber containing a sub-wavelength, nano-fluidic channel and illuminate them using the fiber's strongly confined optical mode. The diffusing particles in this cylinderical geometry are continuously illuminated inside the collection focal plane. We show that the method can track unlabeled dielectric particles as small as 20 nm as well as individual cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) virions - 4.6 megadaltons in size - at rates of over 2 kHz for durations of tens of seconds. Our setup is easily incorporated into common optical microscopes and extends their detection range to nanometer-scale particles and macromolecules. The ease-of-use and performance of this technique support its potential for widespread applications in medical diagnostics and micro total analysis systems.",1

For this purpose, we consider the 2d Random Field Ising Model at T = 0 driven by the external field H with athermal dynamics implemented with periodic and forced boundary conditions. We choose a convenient scaling variable z that accounts for the deformation of the distance to the critical point caused by the aspect ratio. Moreover, assuming that the dependence of the finite size scaling functions on the aspect ratio can be accounted by an additional multiplicative factor, we have been able to collapse data for different system sizes, different aspect ratios and different nature of the boundary conditions into a single scaling function Q.",1

For external potentials respecting the symmetry of the vortex lattice, the states with unpaired momenta have degeneracies such that the system always is in a trivial phase.

The explosive finger is formed by an ideally unstable n=1 mode, dominated by an m/n=2/1 component. The quadrupole geometry of the 2/1 perturbed pressure field provides a generic mechanism for the formation of the initial ballooning finger and its subsequent transition from exponential to explosive growth, without relying on secondary processes. The explosive ejection of the hot plasma from the core and stochastization of the magnetic field occur in Alfv\'enic time scales, accounting for the extremely fast growth of the precursor oscillations and the rapidity of the thermal quench in some high-$\beta$ disruptions.",1
59844,0,"On the Numerical Dispersion of Electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell Code : Finite Grid Instability The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method is widely used in relativistic particle beam and laser plasma modeling. However, the PIC method exhibits numerical instabilities that can render unphysical simulation results or even destroy the simulation. For electromagnetic relativistic beam and plasma modeling, the most relevant numerical instabilities are the finite grid instability and the numerical Cherenkov instability. We review the numerical dispersion relation of the electromagnetic PIC algorithm to analyze the origin of these instabilities. We rigorously derive the faithful 3D numerical dispersion of the PIC algorithm, and then specialize to the Yee FDTD scheme. In particular, we account for the manner in which the PIC algorithm updates and samples the fields and distribution function. Temporal and spatial phase factors from solving Maxwell's equations on the Yee grid with the leapfrog scheme are also explicitly accounted for. Numerical solutions to the electrostatic-like modes in the 1D dispersion relation for a cold drifting plasma are obtained for parameters of interest. In the succeeding analysis, we investigate how the finite grid instability arises from the interaction of the numerical 1D modes admitted in the system and their aliases. The most significant interaction is due critically to the correct represenation of the operators in the dispersion relation. We obtain a simple analytic expression for the peak growth rate due to this interaction.",1
59878,0,"Atmospheric ionization by high-fluence, hard spectrum solar proton events and their probable appearance in the ice core archive Solar energetic particles ionize the atmosphere, leading to production of nitrogen oxides. It has been suggested that some such events are visible as layers of nitrate in ice cores, yielding archives of energetic, high fluence solar proton events (SPEs). There has been controversy, due to slowness of transport for these species down from the upper stratosphere; past numerical simulations based on an analytic calculation have shown very little ionization below the mid stratosphere. These simulations suffer from deficiencies: they consider only soft SPEs and narrow energy ranges; spectral fits are poorly chosen; with few exceptions secondary particles in air showers are ignored. Using improved simulations that follow development of the proton-induced air shower, we find consistency with recent experiments showing substantial excess ionization down to 5 km. We compute nitrate available from the 23 February 1956 SPE, which had a high fluence, hard spectrum, and well-resolved associated nitrate peak in a Greenland ice core. For the first time, we find this event can account for ice core data with timely (~ 2 months) transport downward between 46 km and the surface, thus indicating an archive of high fluence, hard spectrum SPE covering the last several millennia. We discuss interpretations of this result, as well as the lack of a clearly-defined nitrate spike associated with the soft-spectrum 3-4 August 1972 SPE. We suggest that hard-spectrum SPEs, especially in the 6 months of polar winter, are detectable in ice cores, and that more work needs to be done to investigate this.",1
60007,0,"The pitch angle paradox and radiative life times in a synchrotron source In synchrotron radiation there is a paradox whether or not the pitch angle of a radiating charge varies. The conventional wisdom is that the pitch angle does not change during the radiation process. The argument is based on Larmor's radiation formula, where in a synchrotron case the radiation power is along the instantaneous direction of motion of the charge. Then the momentum loss will also be parallel to that direction and therefore the pitch angle of the charge would remain unaffected. The accordingly derived formulas for energy losses of synchrotron electrons in radio galaxies are the standard text-book material for the last 50 years. However, if we use the momentum transformation laws from special relativity, then we find that the pitch angle of a radiating charge varies. While the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field remains unaffected, the perpendicular component does reduce in magnitude due to radiative losses, implying a change in the pitch angle. This apparent paradox is resolved when effects on the charge motion are calculated not from Larmor's formula but from Lorentz's radiation reaction formula. We derive the exact formulation by taking into account the change of the pitch angle due to radiative losses. From this we first time derive the characteristic decay time of synchrotron electrons over which they turn from highly relativistic into mildly relativistic ones.",1

60086,0,"Keck/ESI Long-slit Spectroscopy of SBS 1421+511: A Recoiling Quasar Nucleus in An Active Galaxy Pair? We present Keck/ESI long-slit spectroscopy of SBS 1421+511, a system consisting of a quasar at z = 0.276 and an extended source 3"" northern to the quasar. The quasar shows a blue-skewed profile of Balmer broad emission lines, which can be well modeled as emissions from a circular disk with a blueshift velocity of ~1400 km/s. The blueshift is better interpreted as resulting from a recoiling active black hole than from a super-massive black hole binary, since the line profile almost kept steady over one decade in the quasar rest-frame. Alternative interpretations are possible as well, such as emissions from a bipolar outflow or a circular disk with spiral emissivity perturbations. The extended source shows Seyfert-like narrow line ratios and a [OIII] luminosity of &gt;1.4\times10^8L_\odot, with almost the same redshift as the quasar and a projected distance of 12.5 kpc at the redshift. SBS 1421+511 is thus likely to be an interacting galaxy pair with dual AGN. Alternatively, the quasar companion only appears to be active but not necessarily so: the gas before/in/behind the companion galaxy is illuminated by the quasar as an extended emission line region is detected at a similar distance in the opposite direction southern to the quasar, which may be generated either by tidal interactions between the galaxy pair or large-scale outflows from the quasar.",1
60105,0,"Finite temperature effective field theory for dark solitons in superfluid Fermi gases We use a finite temperature effective field theory recently developed for superfluid Fermi gases to investigate the properties of dark solitons in these superfluids. Our approach provides an analytic solution for the dip in the order parameter and the phase profile accross the soliton, which can be compared with results obtained in the framework of the Bogoliubov - de Gennes equations. We present results in the whole range of the BCS-BEC crossover, for arbitrary temperatures, and taking into account Gaussian fluctuations about the saddle point. The obtained analytic solutions yield an exact energy-momentum relation for a dark soliton showing that the soliton in a Fermi gas behaves like a classical particle even at nonzero temperatures. The spatial profile of the pair field and for the parameters of state for the soliton are analytically studied. In the strong-coupling regime and/or for sufficiently high temperatures, the obtained analytic solutions match well the numeric results obtained using the Bogoliubov - de Gennes equations.",1

We show that this interpretation can be achieved through an improved first-principles method. Our calculation shows that the shift of K-edges exhibits selective sensitivity to thermal parameters and thus would be a suitable temperature index to warm dense plasmas. We also show with a simple model that the shift of K-edges can be used to detect inhomogeneity inside warm dense plasmas when combined with other experimental tools.",1
60248,0,"Supermassive star formation via episodic accretion: protostellar disc instability and radiative feedback efficiency The formation of SMSs is a potential pathway to seed SMBHs in the early universe. A critical issue for forming SMSs is stellar UV feedback, which may limit the stellar mass growth via accretion. In this paper we study the evolution of an accreting SMS and its UV emissivity under conditions of realistic variable accretion from a self-gravitating circumstellar disc. First we conduct a 2D hydrodynamical simulation to follow the long-term protostellar accretion until the stellar mass exceeds $10^4~M_\odot$. The disc fragments due to gravitational instability, creating a number of small clumps that rapidly migrate inward to fall onto the star. The resulting accretion history is thus highly time-dependent: short episodic accretion bursts are followed by longer, relative quiescent phases. We show that the circumstellar disc for the so-called direct collapse model is more unstable and generates greater variability over shorter timescales than normal Pop III cases. We conduct a post-process stellar evolution calculation using the obtained accretion history. Our results show that, regardless of the strong variability of the accretion rates, the stellar radius monotonically increases with almost constant effective temperature at $T_{\rm eff} \simeq 5000$ K as the stellar mass increases. The resulting UV feedback is too weak to hinder mass accretion due to the low flux of stellar UV photons, thus verifying our implicit assumption of no stellar feedback during the hydrodynamic simulations. The insensitivity of stellar evolution to variable accretion is attributed to the fact that typical timescales of variability, $\lesssim 10^3$ years, are too short to affect the stellar structure. We argue that this evolution will continue until the SMS eventually collapses to produce a massive black hole by the general relativistic instability after the stellar mass reaches $\gtrsim 10^5~M_\odot$.",1

60351,0,"Frequency ratio of Yb and Sr clocks with $5 \times 10^{-17}$ uncertainty at 150 s averaging time Transition frequencies of atoms and ions are among the most accurately accessible quantities in nature, playing important roles in pushing the frontiers of science by testing fundamental laws of physics, in addition to a wide range of applications such as satellite navigation systems. Atomic clocks based on optical transitions approach uncertainties of $10^{-18}$, where full frequency descriptions are far beyond the reach of the SI second. Frequency ratios of such super clocks, on the other hand, are not subject to this limitation. They can therefore verify consistency and overall accuracy for an ensemble of super clocks, an essential step towards a redefinition of the second. However, with the measurement stabilities so far reported for such frequency ratios, a confirmation to $1 \times 10^{-18}$ uncertainty would require an averaging time $\tau$ of multiple months. Here we report a measurement of the frequency ratio of neutral ytterbium and strontium clocks with a much improved stability of $4 \times 10^{-16} ({\tau}/s)^{-1/2}$. Enabled by the high stability of optical lattice clocks interrogating hundreds of atoms, this marks a 90-fold reduction in the required averaging time over a previous record-setting experiment that determined the ratio of Al+ and Hg+ single-ion clocks to an uncertainty of $5.2 \times 10^{-17}$.

60407,0,"Image formation properties and inverse imaging problem in aperture based scanning near field optical microscopy Aperture based scanning near field optical microscopes are important instruments to study light at the nanoscale and to understand the optical functionality of photonic nanostructures. In general, a detected image is affected by both, the transverse electric and magnetic field components of light. The discrimination of the individual field components is challenging, as these four field components are contained within two signals in the case of a polarization-resolved measurement. Here, we develop a methodology to solve the inverse imaging problem and to retrieve the vectorial field components from polarization- and phase-resolved measurements. Our methodology relies on the discussion of the image formation process in aperture based scanning near field optical microscopes. On this basis, we are also able to explain how the relative contributions of the electric and magnetic field components within detected images depend on the probe geometry, its material composition, and the illumination wavelength. This allows to design probes that are dominantly sensitive either to the electric or magnetic field components of light.",1
60589,0,"Testing quantised inertia on the emdrive It has been shown that truncated cone-shaped cavities with microwaves resonating within them move slightly towards their narrow ends (the emdrive). Standard physics has no explanation for this and an error has not yet been found. It is shown here that this effect can be predicted by assuming that the inertial mass of the photons in the cavity is caused by Unruh radiation, whose wavelengths must fit exactly within the cavity, using a theory already applied successfully to astrophysical anomalies such as galaxy rotation where the Unruh waves have to fit within the Hubble scale. In the emdrive this means that more Unruh waves are allowed at the wide end, leading to a greater inertial mass for the photons there, and to conserve momentum the cavity must move towards its narrow end, as observed. The model predicts thrusts of: 3.8, 149, 7.3, 0.23, 0.57, 0.11, 0.64 and 0.02 mN compared with the observed thrusts of: 16, 147, 9, 0.09, 0.05, 0.06, 0.03, and 0.02 mN and predicts that if the axial length is equal to the diameter of the small end of the cavity, the thrust should be reversed.",1

Stable fixed points of the renormalization group and their regions of stability are calculated in the one-loop approximation within the three-parameter $(\eps,y,\eta)$-expansion.

For the simultaneous interferometers, this linearization enables a good common-mode rejection of vibration noise, which is usually the main limit for high precision WEP tests of dual-species kind.

60638,0,"Experimental Test of Hyper-Complex Quantum Theories In standard quantum mechanics, complex numbers are used to describe the wavefunction. Although complex numbers have proven sufficient to predict the results of existing experiments, there is no apparent theoretical reason to choose them over real numbers or generalizations of complex numbers, i.e. hyper-complex numbers. Experiments performed to date have proven that real numbers are insufficient, but whether or not hyper-complex numbers are required remains an open question. Quantum theories based on hyper-complex numbers are one example of a post-quantum theory, which must be put on a firm experimental foundation. Here we experimentally probe hyper-complex quantum theories, by studying one of their deviations from complex quantum theory: the non-commutativity of phases. We do so by passing single photons through a Sagnac interferometer containing two physically different phases, having refractive indices of opposite sign. By showing that the phases commute with high precision, we place limits on a particular prediction of hyper-complex quantum theories.",1

The Spitzer Space Telescope visited the field five times between 2004 and 2014 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. We provide the difference image analysis photometry for a half a million mostly extragalactic sources. In mid-IR color-color plane, sources with quasar colors constitute the largest variability class (75%), 16% of the variable objects have stellar colors and the remaining 9% have the colors of galaxies. Adding the fifth epoch doubles the number of variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for the same false positive rates as in SDWFS, or increases the number of sources by 20% while decreasing the false positive rates by factors of 2-3 for the same variability amplitude. We quantify the ensemble mid-IR variability of ~1500 spectroscopically confirmed AGNs using single power-law structure functions (SFs), which we find to be steeper (index $\gamma=0.45$) than in the optical ($\gamma=0.3$), leading to much lower amplitudes at short time-lags. This provides evidence for large emission regions, smoothing out any fast UV/optical variations, as the origin of infrared quasar variability. The mid-IR AGN SF slope $\gamma$ seems to be uncorrelated with both the luminosity and rest-frame wavelength, while the amplitude shows an anti-correlation with the luminosity and a correlation with the rest-frame wavelength.",1
60688,0,"Direct numerical simulation of statistically stationary and homogeneous shear turbulence and its relation to other shear flows Statistically stationary and homogeneous shear turbulence (SS-HST) is investigated by means of a new direct numerical simulation code, spectral in the two horizontal directions and compact-finite-differences in the direction of the shear. No remeshing is used to impose the shear-periodic boundary condition. The influence of the geometry of the computational box is explored. Since HST has no characteristic outer length scale and tends to fill the computational domain, long-term simulations of HST are `minimal' in the sense of containing on average only a few large-scale structures. It is found that the main limit is the spanwise box width, $L_z$, which sets the length and velocity scales of the turbulence, and that the two other box dimensions should be sufficiently large $(L_x\gtrsim 2L_z$, $L_y \gtrsim L_z$) to prevent other directions to be constrained as well. It is also found that very long boxes, $L_x \gtrsim 2 L_y$, couple with the passing period of the shear-periodic boundary condition, and develop strong unphysical linearized bursts. Within those limits, the flow shows interesting similarities and differences with other shear flows, and in particular with the logarithmic layer of wall-bounded turbulence. They are explored in some detail. They include a self-sustaining process for large-scale streaks and quasi-periodic bursting. The bursting time scale is approximately universal, $\sim 20 S^{-1}$, and the availability of two different bursting systems allows the growth of the bursts to be related with some confidence to the shearing of initially isotropic turbulence. It is concluded that SS-HST, conducted within the proper computational parameters, is a very promising system to study shear turbulence in general.",1

60973,0,"On single-photon wave function We present in this paper how the single-photon wave function for transversal photons (with the direct sum of ordinary unitary representations of helicity 1 and -1 acting on it) is subsumed within the formalism of Gupta-Bleuler for the quantized free electromagnetic field in the Krein space (i.e. in the ordinary Hilbert space endowed with the Gupta-Bleuler operator $\eta$). Rigorous Gupta-Bleuler quantization of the free electromagnetic field is based on a generalization of ours (published formerly) of the Mackey theory of induced representations which includes representations preserving the indefinite Krein inner-product given by the Gupta-Bleuler operator and acting in the Krein space. The free electromagnetic field is constructed by application of the Segal's second quantization functor to the specific Krein-isometric representation. A closed subspace $\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$ of the single-photon Krein space on which the indefinite Krein-inner-product is strictly positive is constructed such that the Krein-isometric single-photon representation generates modulo unphysical states precisely the action of a representation which preserves the positive inner product on $\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$ induced by the Krein inner product, and is equal to the direct sum of ordinary unitary representations of helicity 1 and -1 respectively. Two states of single photon Krein space are physically equivalent whenever differ by a state of Krein norm zero and whose projection on $\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$, in the sense of the Krein-inner-product, vanishes.

We further outline the method to feed the reconstructor with both wind speed and direction of each turbulence layer. An end-to-end numerical simulation, assuming a multi-object AO (MOAO) system on a 30 m aperture telescope, shows that the multi time-step reconstruction increases the Strehl ratio (SR) over a scientific FoV of 10 arcminutes in diameter by a factor of 1.5--1.8 when compared to the classical tomographic reconstructor, depending on the guide star asterism and with perfect knowledge of wind speeds and directions. We also evaluate the multi time-step reconstruction method and the wind estimation method on the RAVEN demonstrator under laboratory setting conditions. The wind speeds and directions at multiple atmospheric layers are measured successfully in the laboratory experiment by our wind estimation method with errors below 2 \ms. With these wind estimates, the multi time-step reconstructor increases the SR value by a factor of 1.2--1.5, which is consistent with a prediction from end-to-end numerical simulation.",1
61443,0,"An optimal real-time controller for vertical plasma stabilization Modern Tokamaks have evolved from the initial axisymmetric circular plasma shape to an elongated axisymmetric plasma shape that improves the energy confinement time and the triple product, which is a generally used figure of merit for the conditions needed for fusion reactor performance. However, the elongated plasma cross section introduces a vertical instability that demands a real-time feedback control loop to stabilize the plasma vertical position and velocity. At the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) in-vessel poloidal field coils driven by fast switching power supplies are used to stabilize highly elongated plasmas. TCV plasma experiments have used a PID algorithm based controller to correct the plasma vertical position. In late 2013 experiments a new optimal real-time controller was tested improving the stability of the plasma. This contribution describes the new optimal real-time controller developed. The choice of the model that describes the plasma response to the actuators is discussed. The high order model that is initially implemented demands the application of a mathematical order reduction and the validation of the new reduced model. The lower order model is used to derive the time optimal control law. A new method for the construction of the switching curves of a bang-bang controller is presented that is based on the state-space trajectories that optimize the time to target of the system. A closed loop controller simulation tool was developed to test different possible algorithms and the results were used to improve the controller parameters. The final control algorithm and its implementation are described and preliminary experimental results are discussed.",1
61509,0,"Inferring the Galactic potential with Gaia and friends: synergies with other surveys In the coming decade the Gaia satellite will precisely measure the positions and velocities of millions of stars in the Galactic halo, including stars in many tidal streams. These streams, the products of hierarchical accretion of satellite galaxies by the Milky Way (MW), can be used to infer the Galactic gravitational potential thanks to their initial compactness in phase space. Plans for observations to extend Gaia's radial velocity (RV) measurements to faint stars, and to determine precise distances to RR Lyrae (RRLe) in streams, would further extend the power of Gaia's kinematic catalog to characterize the MW's potential at large Galactocentric distances. In this work I explore the impact of these extra data on the ability to fit the potential using the method of action clustering, which statistically maximizes the information content (clumpiness) of the action space of tidal streams, eliminating the need to determine stream membership for individual stars. Using a mock halo in a toy spherical potential, updated post-launch error models for Gaia, and estimates for RV and distance errors for the tracers to be followed up, I show that combining either form of additional information with the Gaia catalog greatly reduces the bias in determining the scale radius and total mass of the Galaxy, compared to the use of Gaia data alone.",1

In particular, we consider a composite system of qubit(two-dimensional) subsystem, and qutrit, (three-dimensional) subsystem. The degree of entanglement is quantified for different cases, where it is assumed that the two-subsystems are simultaneously or non- simultaneously accelerated. The entanglement decays as the acceleration of any subsystem increases.In general, the decay rate of entanglement increases as the dimensional of the accelerated subsystem increases.

Periodic driving of the lattice allows wide tuning of the system parameters. We solve this model exactly for a special value of the correlated hopping. The solution reveals the general properties of this system for arbitrary filling: exact and asymmetric spin-charge separation, a gapless spectrum of lowest energy excitations, a spin-gap, which may be interpreted in terms of collective hole pairing and a non-vanishing den Nijs-Rommelse type string correlator. Numerical studies away from the integrable point show the persistence of both long range string order and spin-gap.",1
62073,0,"Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Time-Reversal-Symmetry Breaking Topological Insulators The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), the last member of Hall family, was predicted to exhibit quantized Hall conductivity e2/h without any external magnetic field. The QAHE shares a similar physical phenomenon with the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE), whereas its physical origin relies on the intrinsic topological inverted band structure and ferromagnetism. Since the QAHE does not require external energy input in the form of magnetic field, it is believed that this effect has unique potential for applications in future electronic devices with low-power consumption. More recently, the QAHE has been experimentally observed in thin films of the time-reversal symmetry breaking ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulators (TI), Cr- and V- doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3.

62102,0,"The modified Poynting theorem and the concept of mutual energy The goal of this article is to derive the reciprocity theorem, mutual energy theorem from Poynting theorem instead of from Maxwell equation. The Poynting theorem is generalized to the modified Poynting theorem. In the modified Poynting theorem the electromagnetic field is superimposition of different electromagnetic fields including the retarded potential and advanced potential, time-offset field. The media epsilon (permittivity) and mu (permeability) can also be different in the different fields. The concept of mutual energy is introduced which is the difference between the total energy and self-energy. Mixed mutual energy theorem is derived. We derive the mutual energy from Fourier domain. We obtain the time-reversed mutual energy theorem and the mutual energy theorem. Then we derive the mutual energy theorem in time-domain. The instantaneous modified mutual energy theorem is derived. Applying time-offset transform and time integral to the instantaneous modified mutual energy theorem, the time-correlation modified mutual energy theorem is obtained. Assume there are two electromagnetic fields one is retarded potential and one is advanced potential, the convolution reciprocity theorem can be derived. Corresponding to the modified time-correlation mutual energy theorem and the time-convolution reciprocity theorem in Fourier domain, there is the modified mutual energy theorem and the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. Hence all mutual energy theorem and the reciprocity theorems are put in one frame of the concept of the mutual energy. 3 new Complementary theorems are derived. The inner product is introduced for two different electromagnetic fields in both time domain and Fourier domain for the application of the wave expansion.",1
62334,0,Pulse chirp increasing pulse compression followed by positive resonant radiation in fibers Pulse self-compression followed by the generation of resonant radiation is a well known phenomenon in non-linear optics. Resonant radiation is important as it allows for efficient and tunable wavelength conversion. We vary the chirp of the initial pulse and find in simulations and experiments that a small positive chirp enhances the pulse compression and strongly increases the generation of resonant radiation. This result corroborates previously published simulation results indicating an improved degree of pulse compression for a small positive chirp [1]. It also demonstrates how pulse evolution can be studied without cutting back the fiber.,1

These novel storage system are modular and could be applied in different scales for different locations and applications, being very flexible in charge and discharge process.

On the recoverability of LVG model parameters We explore the recoverability of gas physical conditions with the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) model, using the public code RADEX and the molecules HCN and CO. Examining a wide parameter range with a series of models of increasing complexity we use both grid and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to recover the input conditions, and quantify the inherent and noise induced uncertainties in the model results. We find that even with the benefit of generous assumptions the LVG models struggle to recover any parameter better than to within half a dex, although we find no evidence of systemic offsets. Examining isotopologue lines we demonstrate that it is always preferable to model the isotopologue abundance ratio as a free parameter, due to large biases introduced in all other parameters when an incorrect ratio is assumed. Finally, we explore the effects of the background radiation temperature on CO and HCN line ratios, with an emphasis on the effect of the CMB at $z&gt;4$, and show that while the effect on the line ratios is minor, the effect on the SLED peak is significant and that the CO$(1-0)$ line luminosity to H$_2$ mass conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) needs to be altered to account for the loss of contrast against the hotter CMB as redshift increases.",1
62718,0,"Spectroscopy of phonons in dirty superconducting contacts The nonlinearities of current-voltage characteristics (IVC) of superconducting niobium point contacts for voltages of the order of the characteristic phonon frequencies are investigated. It is shown that in limiting by dirty contacts ${{l}_{1}}\ll d$ , (${{l}_{1}}$ is the momentum mean-free path of electrons), features are observed on the IVC corresponding to maxima in the first or second derivatives and are situated at energies close to the characteristic phonon energies. These features are due to the energy dependence of the excess current, since the nonlinearity of the IVC in the normal state is several times smaller in absolute magnitude, and its second derivative is monotonic. For a contact diameter $d$ of the order of several tens of angstroms (the contact resistance is of the order of 100 $\Omega $), the thermal effects can be neglected. It is assumed that in the region of the constriction, the characteristic lengths of the system satisfy the relation $\xi \gtrsim d&gt;{{\Lambda }_{\varepsilon }}$ (${{\Lambda }_{\varepsilon }}$ is the diffusion length for energy relaxation of the electrons, $\xi$ is the coherence length) which makes possible inelastic transitions of electrons between pair chemical potentials differing in energy by an account $eV$ ($V$ is the voltage drop across the contact)",1
62719,0,"Detailed kinetic study of the ring opening of cycloalkanes by CBS-QB3 calculations This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimolecular decomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantum chemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each cycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed have been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data (\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by means of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been included. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the 1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals. Rate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition state theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate constant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have been calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed to validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the rotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of importance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain energies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and show that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed upon the activation process.",1
62774,0,"Common Origin of Power-law Tails in Income Distributions and Relativistic Gases Power-law tails are ubiquitous in income distributions and in the energy distributions of diluted relativistic gases. We analyze the conceptual link between these two cases. In economic interactions fat tails arise because the richest individuals enact some protection mechanisms (""saving propensity"") which allow them to put at stake, in their interactions, only a small part of their wealth. In high-energy particle collisions something similar happens, in the sense that when particles with very large energy collide with slow particles, then as a sole consequence of relativistic kinematics (mass dilation), they tend to exchange only a small part of their energy; processes like the frontal collision of two identical particles, where the exchanged energy is 100%, are very improbable, at least in a diluted gas. We thus show how in two completely different systems, one of socio-economic nature and one of physical nature, a certain feature of the binary microscopic interactions leads to the same consequence in the macroscopic distribution for the income or respectively for the energy.",1
62832,0,"Imaging an Event Horizon: Mitigation of Source Variability of Sagittarius A* The black hole in the center of the Galaxy, associated with the compact source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is predicted to cast a shadow upon the emission of the surrounding plasma flow, which encodes the influence of general relativity in the strong-field regime. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network with a goal of imaging nearby supermassive black holes (in particular Sgr A* and M87) with angular resolution sufficient to observe strong gravity effects near the event horizon. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations show that radio emission from Sgr A* exhibits vari- ability on timescales of minutes, much shorter than the duration of a typical VLBI imaging experiment, which usually takes several hours. A changing source structure during the observations, however, violates one of the basic assumptions needed for aperture synthesis in radio interferometry imaging to work. By simulating realistic EHT observations of a model movie of Sgr A*, we demonstrate that an image of the average quiescent emission, featuring the characteristic black hole shadow and photon ring predicted by general relativity, can nonetheless be obtained by observing over multiple days and subsequent processing of the visibilities (scaling, averaging, and smoothing) before imaging. Moreover, it is shown that this procedure can be combined with an existing method to mitigate the effects of interstellar scattering. Taken together, these techniques allow the black hole shadow in the Galactic center to be recovered on the reconstructed image.",1

We estimate the time evolution of its gas mass and net inflow and outflow rates from the SFH using a simple star formation law that relates the star formation rate to the gas mass. We present a chemical evolution model on a 2D mass grid with supernovae (SNe) as sources of metal enrichment. We find that a key parameter controlling the enrichment is the mass M_x of the gas to mix with the ejecta from each SN. The choice of M_x depends on the evolution of SN remnants and on the global gas dynamics. It differs between the two types of SNe involved and between the periods before and after Fornax became an MW satellite at time t = t_sat . Our results indicate that due to the global gas outflow at t &gt; t_sat , part of the ejecta from each SN may directly escape from Fornax. Sample results from our model are presented and compared with data.",1

In this letter, we study a family of deformed square lattices that display topologically protected zero-energy bulk modes analogous to the massless fermion modes of Weyl semimetals. Our findings apply to sufficiently complex lattices satisfying the Maxwell criterion of equal numbers of constraints and degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that such systems exhibit pairs of oppositely charged Weyl points, corresponding to zero-frequency bulk modes, that can appear at the origin of the Brillouin zone and move away to the zone edge (or return to the origin) where they annihilate. We prove that the existence of these Weyl points leads to a wavenumber-dependent count of topological mechanical states at free surfaces and domain walls.",1

63597,0,"Decoherence in the classical limit of histories of a particle coupled to a von Neumann apparatus Using the Gell-Mann and Hartle formalism of generalized quantum mechanics of closed systems, we study the classical limit of coarse-grained spacetime histories and their decoherence. The system under consideration is one-dimensional and consists of a particle coupled to a von Neumann apparatus that performs a measurement of the position of the particle during the finite time interval during which the histories of this system take place. We consider two cases: a free particle and a harmonic oscillator. The real line is divided into intervals of the same length, and coarse-grained histories are defined by the time average of the position of the particle on a given Feynman path to be within one of these intervals. The position of the pointer in each Feynman path correlates with this time average. The class operators for this system have been evaluated, and the decoherence functional shows that these coarse-grained histories do not decohere, not even when initially either the particle or the pointer is in an eigenstate of position. Decoherence is obtained only when the classical limit is taken. Qualitative arguments for decoherence in the classical limit are presented for the case of a general particle potential.",1

For this purpose we include the electronic correlation by an effective potential and within an active-electron model. Due to its experimental interest, evaluation of decay rates are performed for berylliumlike xenon and uranium. We find that the negative-energy contribution can be neglected in the present decay rate. On the other hand, if contributions of electronic correlation are not carefully taken into account, it may change the lifetime of the metastable state by 20\%.

A recent alternative formulation of Newtonian gravity due to Saunders (Philosophy of Science 80 (2013) pp.22-48) provides a conceptually satisfactory cosmology but fails to reproduce the Newtonian limit of general relativity in homogenous but anisotropic universes.

With this aim, a new formula which relates the Gauss curvatures of the induced metric and of the $\eta$-second fundamental form is developed. Then, totally umbilical round spheres are characterized as the only compact spacelike surfaces through the lightcone such that its $\eta$-second fundamental form is non-degenerate and has constant Gauss curvature two.

64900,0,"Diagnostics From Three Rising Submillimeter Bursts In the paper we investigate three novel rising submillimeter (THz) bursts occurred sequentially in a super-Active Region NOAA 10486. The average rising rate of the flux density above 200 GHz is only 20 sfu/GHz (corresponding spectral index $\alpha$ of 1.6) for the THz spectral components of 2003 October 28 and November 4 bursts, while it can attain values of 235 sfu/GHz ($\alpha$=4.8) for 2003 November 2 burst. The steeply rising THz spectrum can be produced by a population of high relativistic electrons with a low-energy cutoff of 1 MeV , while it only requires a low-energy cutoff of 30 keV for the two slowly rising THz bursts, via gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation based on our numerical simulations of burst spectra in the magnetic dipole field case. The electron density variation is much larger in the THz source than that in microwave (MW) one. It is interesting that the THz source radius decreased by 20--50$\%$ during the decay phase for the three events, but the MW one increased by 28$\%$ for the 2003 November 2 event. In the paper we will present a calculation formula of energy released by ultrarelativistic electrons, accounting the relativistic correction for the first time. We find that the energy released by energetic electrons in the THz source exceeds that in microwave one due to the strong GS radiation loss at THz range, although the modeled THz source area is 3--4 orders smaller than the modeled MW one. The total energies released by energetic electrons via the GS radiation in radio sources are estimated, respectively, to be $5.2\times10^{33}$, $3.9\times10^{33}$ and $3.7\times10^{32}$ erg for the October 28, November 2 and 4 bursts, which are 131, 76 and 4 times as large as the thermal energies of $2.9\times10^{31}$, $2.1\times10^{31}$ and $5.2\times10^{31}$ erg estimated from the soft x-ray GOES observations.",1

Many half-Heusler compounds have been theoretically predicted to be topological semimetals. Of these many are also superconductors, are magnetic or show Kondo behavior. Recently, experimental evidence was found for an unusual topological surface state, and a chiral anomaly that is a characteristic feature of a Weyl semimetal in lanthanide half-Heusler compounds. Here we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic Heusler compounds GdPtBi and NdPtBi show three signatures of a chiral anomaly, namely, a large non-saturated negative magnetoresistance for fields up to 60 T, a quadratic field dependence of the magneto-conductivity, and an unusual intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, all three observed far above the magnetic ordering temperature. We show that the Weyl points are induced in a magnetic field via exchange-splitting of the conduction bands. A generic, complex magneto-transport phase diagram for magnetic topological Heusler compounds is presented that is distinguished from that of non-magnetic Heusler compounds, such as YPtBi. Our observations open the path for the study of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic Heusler compounds and of Majorana fermions in topological Heusler compounds with co-existing superconductivity.",1

65052,0,"Invisibility cloaks in relativistic motion We consider an ideal invisibility cloak which is illuminated by monochromatic light and which moves in vacuum at constant relativistic velocity with respect to the common inertial frame of light source and observer. We show that, in general, the moving cloak becomes detectable by image distortions and by generating a broad frequency spectrum of the scattered light. However, for many special combinations of incident light frequency, wave vector of light, and cloak velocity, ideal cloaking remains possible. It becomes non-reciprocal though. This means that light rays emitted by the light source arrive at the observer as though they have travelled through vacuum, but they take completely different paths after being retro-reflected at the observer position.",1

Yet the measured performances are always significantly below the predicted values obtained from numerical simulations. Here we report on a detailed comparison between theoretical and experimental performances. We show that the discrepancy can be explained by the true shape of the plasmonic structures. Taking into account the fabrication details, a new optimisation model enables us to achieve excellent agreement with the observed response and to re-optimise the grating parameters to ensure experimental extinction ratios well above 1,000 at 850 nm.",1

65231,0,"A modified algebraic reconstruction technique taking refraction into account with an application in terahertz tomography Terahertz (THz) tomography is a rather novel technique for nondestructive testing that is particularly suited for the testing of plastics and ceramics. Previous publications showed a large variety of conventional algorithms adapted from computed tomography or ultrasound tomography which were directly applied to THz tomography. Conventional algorithms neglect the specific nature of THz radiation, i.e. refraction at interfaces, reflection losses and the beam profile (Gaussian beam), which results in poor reconstructions. The aim is the efficient reconstruction of the complex refractive index, since it indicates inhomogeneities in the material. A hybrid algorithm has been developed based on the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). ART is adapted by including refraction (Snell's law) and reflection losses (Fresnel equations). Our method uses a priori information about the interface and layer geometry of the sample. This results in the 'Modified ART for THz tomography', which reconstructs simultaneously the complex refractive index from transmission coefficient and travel time measurements.",1

A Mach-Zehnder-type atom interferometer is exploited to sequentially measure the free fall acceleration of the atoms in these two sublevels, and the resultant E$\rm{\ddot{o}}$tv$\rm{\ddot{o}}$s ratio determined by this work is ${\eta_S} =(-0.2\pm1.5)\times 10^{-5}$. The interferometer using atoms in $m_F=+1$ or $m_F=-1$ is highly sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneity, which limits the current experimental precision of our UFF test.

65490,0,"The Flatness and Sudden Evolution of the Intergalactic Ionizing Background The ionizing background of cosmic hydrogen is an important probe of the sources and absorbers of ionizing radiation in the post-reionization universe. Previous studies show that the ionization rate should be very sensitive to changes in the source population: as the emissivity rises, absorbers shrink in size, increasing the ionizing mean free path and, hence, the ionizing background. By contrast, observations of the ionizing background find a very flat evolution from z~2-5, before falling precipitously at z~6. We resolve this puzzling discrepancy by pointing out that, at z~2-5, optically thick absorbers are associated with the same collapsed halos that host ionizing sources. Thus, an increasing abundance of galaxies is compensated for by a corresponding increase in the absorber population, which moderates the instability in the ionizing background. However, by z~5-6, gas outside of halos dominates the absorption, the coupling between sources and absorbers is lost, and the ionizing background evolves rapidly. Our halo based model reproduces observations of the ionizing background, its flatness and sudden decline, as well as the redshift evolution of the ionizing mean free path. Our work suggests that, through much of their history, both star formation and photoelectric opacity in the universe track halo growth.",1
65632,0,"Surpassing the Path-Limited Resolution of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer with Frequency Combs Fourier transform spectroscopy based on incoherent light sources is a well-established tool in research fields from molecular spectroscopy and atmospheric monitoring to material science and biophysics. It provides broadband molecular spectra and information about the molecular structure and composition of absorptive media. However, the spectral resolution is fundamentally limited by the maximum delay range ({\Delta}$_{max}$) of the interferometer, so acquisition of high-resolution spectra implies long measurement times and large instrument size. We overcome this limit by combining the Fourier transform spectrometer with an optical frequency comb and measuring the intensities of individual comb lines by precisely matching the {\Delta}$_{max}$ to the comb line spacing. This allows measurements of absorption lines narrower than the nominal (optical path-limited) resolution without ringing effects from the instrumental lineshape and reduces the acquisition time and interferometer length by orders of magnitude.",1
65733,0,Macroscopic Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking at Nonequilibrium Phase Transition We study the entropy production in a macroscopic nonequilibrium system that undergoes an order-disorder phase transition. Entropy production is a characteristic feature of nonequilibrium dynamics with broken detailed balance. It is found that the entropy production rate per particle vanishes in the disordered phase and becomes positive in the ordered phase following critical scaling laws. We derive the scaling relations for associated critical exponents. Our study reveals that a nonequilibrium ordered state is sustained at the expense of macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking with an extensive entropy production while a disordered state costs only a subextensive entropy production.,1

In particular we obtain an explicit and geometrically meaningful formula for the subelliptic heat kernel. The key idea is to work in a set of coordinates that reflects the symmetry coming from the Hopf fibration S1-&gt;H2n+1. A direct application is obtaining small time asymptotics of the subelliptic heat kernel. Also we derive an explicit formula for the sub-Riemannian distance on H2n+1,1

We show two chiral Majorana fermions on a QAH edge with SC proximity generically have a momentum difference $\Delta k$, which depends on the chemical potentials of both the QAH insulator and the SC. Due to the spatial interference induced by $\Delta k$, the longitudinal conductance of QAH-SC junctions oscillates with respect to the edge lengths and the chemical potentials, which can be probed via charge transport. Furthermore, we show the dynamical SC phase fluctuation will give rise to a geometrical correction to the longitudinal conductance of the junctions.",1

To advance, the field of visible-light interferometry requires development of instruments capable of combining light from 15 baselines (6 telescopes) simultaneously. The Visible Imaging System for Interferometric Observations at NPOI (VISION) is a new visible light beam combiner for the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) that uses single-mode fibers to coherently combine light from up to six telescopes simultaneously with an image-plane combination scheme. It features a photometric camera for calibrations and spatial filtering from single-mode fibers with two Andor Ixon electron multiplying CCDs. This paper presents the VISION system, results of laboratory tests, and results of commissioning on-sky observations. A new set of corrections have been determined for the power spectrum and bispectrum by taking into account non-Gaussian statistics and read noise present in electron-multipying CCDs to enable measurement of visibilities and closure phases in the VISION post-processing pipeline. The post-processing pipeline has been verified via new on-sky observations of the O-type supergiant binary $\zeta$ Orionis A, obtaining a flux ratio of $2.18\pm0.13$ mag with a position angle of $223.9\pm1.0^{\circ}$ and separation $40.6\pm1.8$ mas over 570-750 nm, in good agreement with expectations from the previously published orbit.",1

In addition, all conformal $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$-derivations of finite simple Lie conformal algebras are characterized.",1
66075,0,"Photon Bubble Turbulence in Cold Atomic Gases Turbulent radiation flow is ubiquitous in many physical systems where light-matter interaction becomes relevant. Photon bubbling, in particular, has been identified as the main source of turbulent radiation transport in many astrophysical objects, such as stars and accretion disks. This mechanism takes place when radiation trapping in optically dense media becomes unstable, leading to the energy dissipation from the larger to the smaller bubbles. Here, we report on the observation of photon bubble turbulence in cold atomic gases in the presence of multiple scattering of light. The instability is theoretically explained by a fluid description for the atom density coupled to a diffusive transport equation for the photons, which is known to be accurate in the multiple scattering regime investigated here. We determine the power spectrum of the atom density fluctuations, which displays an unusual $\sim k^{-4}$ scaling, and entails a complex underlying turbulent dynamics resulting from the formation of dynamical bubble-like structures. We derive a power spectrum from the theoretical photon bubble model which, to a high level of accuracy, explains the observations. The experimental results reported here, along with the theoretical model we developed may shed light on the analogue photon bubble instabilities in astrophysical scenarios.",1

More precisely, we show the algebraic decay of the correlation determinant $\big|\det\big(\langle\varphi_j^L, \psi_k^L\rangle\big)_{j,k=1,...,N}\big|^2= L^{-\zeta(E)+ \text{o}(1)}$, as $N,L\to\infty$ and $N/|B_L|\to~ \rho&gt;0$, where $\varphi_j^L$ and $\psi_k^L$ denote the lowest-energy eigenfunctions of the finite-volume one-particle Schr\""odinger operators. The decay exponent is given in terms of the s-wave scattering phase shift $\zeta(E):=\delta^2(\sqrt E)/{\pi^2}$. For an attractive Dirac-$\delta$ perturbation we conclude that the decay exponent $\frac 1 {\pi^2}\Vert\arcsin |T(E)/2|\Vert^2_{\text{HS}}$ found in [GKMO14] does not provide a sharp upper bound on the decay of the correlation determinant.",1
66276,0,"Unveiling Gargantua: A new search strategy for the most massive central cluster black holes We aim to unveil the most massive central cluster black holes in the universe. We present a new search strategy which is based on a black hole mass gain sensitive 'calorimeter' and which links the innermost stellar density profile of a galaxy to the adiabatic growth of its central SMBH. In a first step we convert observationally inferred feedback powers into SMBH growth rates by using reasonable energy conversion efficiency parameters, $\epsilon$. In the main part of this paper we use these black hole growth rates, sorted in logarithmically increasing steps encompassing our whole parameter space, to conduct $N$-Body computations of brightest cluster galaxies with the newly developed MUESLI software. For the initial setup of galaxies we use core-Sersic models in order to account for SMBH scouring. We find that adiabatically driven core re-growth is significant at the highest accretion rates. As a result, the most massive black holes should be located in BCGs with less pronounced cores when compared to the predictions of empirical scaling relations which are usually calibrated in less extreme environments. For efficiency parameters $\epsilon&lt;0.1$, BCGs in the most massive, relaxed and X-ray luminous galaxy clusters might even develop steeply rising density cusps. Finally, we discuss several promising candidates for follow up investigations, among them the nuclear black hole in the Phoenix cluster. Based on our results, it might have a mass of the order of $10^{11} M_\odot$.",1
66355,0,"Observation of Fundamental Thermal Noise in Optical Fibers down to Infrasonic Frequencies The intrinsic thermal noise in optical fibers is the ultimate limit of fiber-based systems. However, at infrasonic frequencies, the spectral behavior of the intrinsic thermal noise remains unclear so far. We present the measurements of the fundamental thermal noise in optical fibers obtained using a balanced fiber Michelson interferometer. When an ultra-stable laser is used as the laser source and other noise sources are carefully controlled, the 1/f spectral density of thermal noise is observed down to infrasonic frequencies and the measured magnitude is consistent with the theoretical predictions at the frequencies from 0.2 Hz to 20 kHz. Moreover, as observed in the experiment, the level of 1/f thermal noise is reduced by changing the coating of optical fibers. Therefore, a possible way to reduce the thermal noise in optical fibers at low Fourier frequencies is indicated. Finally, the inconsistency between the experimental data on thermomechanical noise and existing theory is discussed.",1
66414,0,"Discy dwarf disruption and the shape of the Galactic halo The shape of the Galactic dark halo can, in principle, be inferred through modelling of stellar tidal streams in the Milky Way halo. The brightest and the longest of these, the Sagittarius stream, reaches out to large Galactocentric distances and hence can deliver the tightest constraints on the Galaxy's potential. In this contribution, we revisit the idea that the Sagittarius Stream was formed from a rotating progenitor. We demonstrate that the angle between the disk's angular momentum and the progenitor's orbital angular momentum does not remain constant throughout the disruption. Instead, it undergoes a dramatic evolution caused, in part, by the changes in the progenitor's moment of inertia tensor. We show that, even in a spherical potential, the streams produced as a result of a disky dwarf disruption appear to be ""precessing"". Yet, this debris plane evolution is illusory as it is solely caused by the swaying and wobbling of the progenitor's disk. Stream plane precession is therefore not an unambiguous indicator of asphericity of the dark halo.",1

66450,0,"Data Compression in the Petascale Astronomy Era: a GERLUMPH case study As the volume of data grows, astronomers are increasingly faced with choices on what data to keep -- and what to throw away. Recent work evaluating the JPEG2000 (ISO/IEC 15444) standards as a future data format standard in astronomy has shown promising results on observational data. However, there is still a need to evaluate its potential on other type of astronomical data, such as from numerical simulations. GERLUMPH (the GPU-Enabled High Resolution cosmological MicroLensing parameter survey) represents an example of a data intensive project in theoretical astrophysics. In the next phase of processing, the ~27 terabyte GERLUMPH dataset is set to grow by a factor of 100 -- well beyond the current storage capabilities of the supercomputing facility on which it resides. In order to minimise bandwidth usage, file transfer time, and storage space, this work evaluates several data compression techniques. Specifically, we investigate off-the-shelf and custom lossless compression algorithms as well as the lossy JPEG2000 compression format. Results of lossless compression algorithms on GERLUMPH data products show small compression ratios (1.35:1 to 4.69:1 of input file size) varying with the nature of the input data. Our results suggest that JPEG2000 could be suitable for other numerical datasets stored as gridded data or volumetric data. When approaching lossy data compression, one should keep in mind the intended purposes of the data to be compressed, and evaluate the effect of the loss on future analysis. In our case study, lossy compression and a high compression ratio do not significantly compromise the intended use of the data for constraining quasar source profiles from cosmological microlensing.",1
66541,0,"The tight relation between X-ray and ultraviolet luminosity of quasars The observed relation between the soft X-ray and the optical-ultraviolet emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is non-linear and it is usually parametrized as a dependence between the logarithm of the monochromatic luminosity at 2500 {\AA} and at 2 keV. Previous investigations have found that the dispersion of this relation is rather high (~0.35-0.4 in log units), which may be caused by measurement uncertainties, variability, and intrinsic dispersion due to differences in the AGN physical properties (e.g. different accretion modes). We show that, once optically-selected quasars with homogeneous SED and X-ray detection are selected, and dust reddened and/or gas obscured objects are not included, the measured dispersion drops to significantly lower values (i.e. ~0.21-0.24 dex). We show that the residual dispersion is due to some extent to variability, and to remaining measurement uncertainties. Therefore, the real physical intrinsic dispersion should be &lt;0.21 dex. Such a tight relation, valid over 4 decades in luminosity, must be the manifestation of an intrinsic (and universal) physical relation between the disk, emitting the primary radiation, and the hot electron corona emitting X-rays.",1

I: photometry of the delicate stellar stream of the Palomar 5 globular cluster We present an analysis of wide-field photometric surveys of the Palomar 5 globular cluster and its stellar stream, based on g- and r-band measures together with narrow-band DDO51 photometry. In this first study, we use the deep (g,r) data to measure the incidence of gaps and peaks along the stream. Examining the star-counts profile of the stream plus contaminating populations, we find no evidence for significant under-densities, and find only a single significant over-density. This is at odds with earlier studies based on matched-filter maps derived from shallower SDSS data if the contaminating population possesses plausible spatial properties. The lack of substantial sub-structure along the stream may be used in future dynamical simulations to examine the incidence of dark matter sub-halos in the Galactic halo. We also present a measurement of the relative distances along the stream which we use to create the deepest wide-field map of this system to date.",1

Any observation only provides information about the invariant relations between such objects. The trajectory of a quantum system is a sequence of unitary evolutions interspersed with observations -- non-unitary projections.

The eigenfrequencies of conventional cavities are a function of its geometry, and, thus, the size and shape of a resonant cavity is selected in order to operate at a specific frequency. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the existence of geometry-invariant resonant cavities, i.e., resonators whose eigenfrequency is invariant with respect to geometrical deformations. This effect is obtained by exploiting the unusual properties of zero-index metamaterials, which enable decoupling of the time and spatial field variations. This new class of resonators may inspire alternative design concepts, and it might lead to the first generation of deformable resonant devices.",1

Based on particle-in-cell simulations, we show that both the core-halo feature and kinetic scale turbulence observed in the solar wind can be produced by the nonlinear evolution of electron two-stream instability driven by nanoflare accelerated electron beams.

The paper analyzes a more general case where PT symmetry is achieved by modulating both the real and imaginary part of the material refractive index along the resonator chain. The band-structure of the finite periodic PT resonator chains is compared to infinite chains in order to understand the complex interdependence of the Bloch phase and the amount of the gain/loss in the system that causes the PT symmetry to break. The results show that the type of the modulation along the unit cell can significantly affect the position of the threshold point of the PT system. In all cases the lowest threshold is achieved near the end of the Brillouin zone. In the case of finite PT-chains, and for a particular type of modulation, early PT symmetry breaking is observed and shown to be caused by the presence of termination states localized at the edges of the finite chain resulting in localized lasing and dissipative modes at each end of the chain.",1
67424,0,"Performance and Degradation of A Lithium-Bromine Rechargeable Fuel Cell Using Highly Concentrated Catholytes Lithium-air batteries have been considered as ultimate solutions for the power source of long-range electrified transportation, but state-of-the-art prototypes still suffer from short cycle life, low efficiency and poor power output. Here, a lithium-bromine rechargeable fuel cell using highly concentrated bromine catholytes is demonstrated with comparable specific energy, improved power density, and higher efficiency. The cell is similar in structure to a hybrid-electrolyte Li-air battery, where a lithium metal anode in nonaqueous electrolyte is separated from aqueous bromine catholytes by a lithium-ion conducting ceramic plate. The cell with a flat graphite electrode can discharge at a peak power density around 9mW cm-2 and in principle could provide a specific energy of 791.8 Wh kg-1, superior to most existing cathode materials and catholytes. It can also run in regenerative mode to recover the lithium metal anode and free bromine with 80-90% voltage efficiency, without any catalysts. Degradation of the solid electrolyte and the evaporation of bromine during deep charging are challenges that should be addressed in improved designs to fully exploit the high specific energy of liquid bromine. The proposed system offers a potential power source for long-range electric vehicles, beyond current Li-ion batteries yet close to envisioned Li-air batteries.",1
67618,0,"Asymmetric mass models of disk galaxies - I. Messier 99 Mass models of galactic disks traditionally rely on axisymmetric density and rotation curves, paradoxically acting as if their most remarkable asymmetric features, such as lopsidedness or spiral arms, were not important. In this article, we relax the axisymmetry approximation and introduce a methodology that derives 3D gravitational potentials of disk-like objects and robustly estimates the impacts of asymmetries on circular velocities in the disk midplane. Mass distribution models can then be directly fitted to asymmetric line-of-sight velocity fields. Applied to the grand-design spiral M99, the new strategy shows that circular velocities are highly nonuniform, particularly in the inner disk of the galaxy, as a natural response to the perturbed gravitational potential of luminous matter. A cuspy inner density profile of dark matter is found in M99, in the usual case where luminous and dark matter share the same center. The impact of the velocity nonuniformity is to make the inner profile less steep, although the density remains cuspy. On another hand, a model where the halo is core dominated and shifted by 2.2-2.5 kpc from the luminous mass center is more appropriate to explain most of the kinematical lopsidedness evidenced in the velocity field of M99. However, the gravitational potential of luminous baryons is not asymmetric enough to explain the kinematical lopsidedness of the innermost regions, irrespective of the density shape of dark matter. This discrepancy points out the necessity of an additional dynamical process in these regions: possibly a lopsided distribution of dark matter.",1

While the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement and spin fluctuations are already known to provide insights into the nature of the many-body localized phases, we discuss the relevance of these quantities in the context of the localization transition. In particular, we observe that near the transition the long time limits of both quantities show behavior similar to divergent thermodynamic fluctuations.",1

The impact of twisted light is widening as recent numerical calculations provided solutions to long-standing challenges in plasma-based acceleration by allowing for high gradient positron acceleration. The production of ultrahigh intensity twisted laser pulses could then also have a broad influence on relativistic laser-matter interactions. Here we show theoretically and with ab-initio three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, that stimulated Raman backscattering can generate and amplify twisted lasers to Petawatt intensities in plasmas.

A high transmissivity of 40 % for fluorine K{\alpha} (0.677 keV) radiation is demonstrated for a GC thickness of 650 nm. The GC membranes outperform beryllium (Be) windows, in terms of higher x-ray transmission and better mechanical stability while avoiding the toxicity of Be. Optical profilometry has been employed to visualize a large deformation of the GC layer during the window fabrication.

67930,0,"Fowler-Nordheim Plot Analysis: a Progress Report The commonest method of characterizing a cold field electron emitter is to measure its current-voltage characteristics, and the commonest method of analysing these characteristics is by means of a Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plot. This tutorial/review-type paper outlines a more systematic method of setting out the Fowler-Nordheim-type theory of cold field electron emission, and brings together and summarises the current state of work by the authors on developing the theory and methodology of FN plot analysis. This has turned out to be far more complicated than originally expected. Emphasis is placed in this paper on: (a) the interpretation of FN-plot slopes, which is currently both easier and of more experimental interest than the analysis of FN-plot intercepts; and (b) preliminary explorations into developing methodology for interpreting current-voltage characteristics when there is series resistance in the conduction path from the high-voltage generator to the emitter's emitting regions. This work reinforces our view that FN-plot analysis is best carried out on the raw measured current-voltage data, without pre-conversion into another data format, particularly if series resistance is present in the measuring circuit. Relevant formulae are given for extracting field-enhancement-factor values from such an analysis.",1

68017,0,"The topological Anderson insulator phase in the Kane-Mele model It has been proposed that adding disorder to a topologically trivial mercury telluride/cadmium telluride (HgTe/CdTe) quantum well can induce a transition to a topologically nontrivial state. The resulting state was termed topological Anderson insulator and was found in computer simulations of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Here, we show that the topological Anderson insulator is a more universal phenomenon and also appears in the Kane-Mele model of topological insulators on a honeycomb lattice. We numerically investigate the interplay of the relevant parameters, and establish the parameter range in which the topological Anderson insulator exists. A staggered sublattice potential turns out to be a necessary condition for the transition to the topological Anderson insulator. For weak enough disorder, a calculation based on the lowest-order Born approximation reproduces quantitatively the numerical data. Our results thus considerably increase the number of candidate materials for the topological Anderson insulator phase.",1
68098,0,"Off-equilibrium scaling behaviors driven by time-dependent external fields in three-dimensional O(N) vector models We consider the dynamical off-equilibrium behavior of the three-dimensional O$(N)$ vector model in the presence of a slowly-varying time-dependent spatially-uniform magnetic field ${\bm H}(t) = h(t)\,{\bm e}$, where ${\bm e}$ is a $N$-dimensional constant unit vector, $h(t)=t/t_s$, and $t_s$ is a time scale, at fixed temperature $T\le T_c$, where $T_c$ corresponds to the continuous order-disorder transition. The dynamic evolutions start from equilibrium configurations at $h_i &lt; 0$, correspondingly $t_i &lt; 0$, and end at time $t_f &gt; 0$ with $h(t_f) &gt; 0$, or vice versa. We show that the magnetization displays an off-equilibrium scaling behavior close to the transition line ${\bm H}(t)=0$. It arises from the interplay among the time $t$, the time scale $t_s$, and the finite size $L$. The scaling behavior can be parametrized in terms of the scaling variables $t_s^\kappa/L$ and $t/t_s^{\kappa_t}$, where $\kappa&gt;0$ and $\kappa_t &gt; 0$ are appropriate universal exponents, which differ at the critical point and for $T &lt; T_c$. In the latter case, $\kappa$ and $\kappa_t$ also depend on the shape of the lattice and on the boundary conditions. We present numerical results for the Heisenberg ($N=3$) model under a purely relaxational dynamics. They confirm the predicted off-equilibrium scaling behaviors at and below $T_c$. We also discuss hysteresis phenomena in round-trip protocols for the time dependence of the external field. We define a scaling function for the hysteresis loop area of the magnetization that can be used to quantify how far the system is from equilibrium.",1

This flow is generated by a symmetry of the integrable partial differential equation (pde) $m_t+um_x+3mu_x=0, m=u-\alpha^2u_{xx}$ ($\al $ is a constant). This equation -- called the Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation -- was recently proven to be completely integrable and possess peakon solutions by Degasperis, Holm and Hone (DHH[2002]).

68445,0,"An adjoint based method for the inversion of the Juno and Cassini gravity measurements into wind fields During 2016-17 the Juno and Cassini spacecraft will both perform close eccentric orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, obtaining high-precision gravity measurements for these planets. This data will be used to estimate the depth of the observed surface flows on these planets. All models to date, relating the winds to the gravity field, have been in the forward direction, thus allowing only calculation of the gravity field from given wind models. However, there is a need to do the inverse problem since the new observations will be of the gravity field. Here, an inverse dynamical model, is developed to relate the expected measurable gravity field, to perturbations of the density and wind fields, and therefore to the observed cloud-level winds. In order to invert the gravity field into the 3D circulation, an adjoint model is constructed for the dynamical model, thus allowing backward integration. This tool is used for examination of various scenarios, simulating cases in which the depth of the wind depends on latitude. We show that it is possible to use the gravity measurements to derive the depth of the winds, both on Jupiter and Saturn, taking into account also measurement errors. Calculating the solution uncertainties, we show that the wind depth can be determined more precisely in the low-to-midlatitudes. In addition, the gravitational moments are found to be particularly sensitive to flows at the equatorial intermediate depths, therefore we expect that if deep winds exist on these planets they will have a measurable signature by Juno and Cassini.",1

Modern astronomy presents a variety of such phenomena in the form of transient events in digital synoptic sky surveys, including cosmic explosions (supernovae, gamma ray bursts), relativistic phenomena (black hole formation, jets), potentially hazardous asteroids, etc. We have been developing a set of machine learning tools to detect, classify and plan a response to transient events for astronomy applications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a scientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the potentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the scientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys.

We analyze the first directly imaged and spectrally resolved X-rays above 2~keV from non-flaring ARs, observed near the west limb on 2014 November 1. The NuSTAR X-ray images match bright features seen in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-rays. The NuSTAR imaging spectroscopy is consistent with isothermal emission of temperatures $3.1-4.4$~MK and emission measures $1-8\times 10^{46}$~cm$^{-3}$. We do not observe emission above 5~MK but our short effective exposure times restrict the spectral dynamic range. With few counts above 6~keV, we can place constraints on the presence of an additional hotter component between 5 and 12~MK of $\sim 10^{46}$cm$^{-3}$ and $\sim 10^{43}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, at least an order of magnitude stricter than previous limits.

Among a sample of 511 UCDs and ESCs complied from the literature, 17 X-ray counterparts with 0.5-8 keV luminosities above $\sim$$5\times10^{36} {\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$ are identified, which are distributed in eight early-type host galaxies. To facilitate comparison, we also identify X-ray counterparts of 360 globular clusters (GCs) distributed in four of the eight galaxies. The X-ray properties of the UCDs and ESCs are found to be broadly similar to those of the GCs. The incidence rate of X-ray-detected UCDs and ESCs, $(3.3\pm0.8)$\%, while lower than that of the X-ray-detected GCs [($7.0\pm0.4)$\%], is substantially higher than expected from the field populations of external galaxies. A stacking analysis of the individually undetected UCDs/ESCs further reveals significant X-ray signals, which corresponds to an equivalent 0.5-8 keV luminosity of $\sim$$4\times10^{35} {\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$ per source. Taken together, these provide strong evidence that the X-ray emission from UCDs and ESCs is dominated by low-mass X-ray binaries having formed from stellar dynamical interactions, consistent with the stellar populations in these dense systems being predominantly old. For the most massive UCDs, there remains the possibility that a putative central massive black hole gives rise to the observed X-ray emission.",1

Moreover, the collapse appears to be nonlocal in a sense which seems at odds with General Relativity. In this article the possibility that the wavefunction evolves continuously and hopefully unitarily during the measurement process is analyzed. It is argued that such a solution has to be formulated using a time symmetric replacement of the initial value problem in Quantum Mechanics. Major difficulties in apparent conflict with unitary evolution are identified, but eventually its possibility is not completely ruled out. This interpretation is in a weakened sense both local and realistic, without contradicting Bell's theorem. Moreover, if it is true, it makes Quantum Mechanics consistent with General Relativity in the semiclassical framework.",1

69590,0,"Formation probabilities and Shannon information and their time evolution after quantum quench in transverse-field XY-chain We first provide a formula to calculate the probability of occurrence of different configurations (formation probabilities) in a generic free fermion system. We then study the scaling of these probabilities with respect to the size in the case of critical transverse-field XY-chain in the $\sigma^z$ bases. In the case of the transverse field Ising model, we show that all the ""crystal"" configurations follow the formulas expected from conformal field theory (CFT). In the case of critical $XX$ chain, we show that the only configurations that follow the formulas of the CFT are the ones which respect the filling factor of the system. By repeating all the calculations in the presence of open and periodic boundary conditions we find further support to our classification of different configurations. Using the developed technique, we also study Shannon information of a subregion in our system. In this respect we distinguish particular configurations that are more important in the study of the scaling limit of the Shannon information of the subsystem. Finally, we study the evolution of formation probabilities, Shannon information and Shannon mutual information after a quantum quench in free fermion system. In particular, for the intial state considered in this paper, we demonstrate that the Shannon information after quantum quench first increases with the time and then saturates at time $t^*=\frac{l}{2}$, where $l$ is the size of the subsystem.",1
69609,0,"Kibble-Zurek mechanism beyond adiabaticity: Finite-time scaling with critical initial slip The Kibble-Zurek mechanism demands an initial adiabatic stage before an impulse stage to have a frozen correlation length that generates topological defects in a cooling phase transition. Here we study such a driven critical dynamics but with an initial condition that is near the critical point and that is far away from equilibrium. In this case, there is no initial adiabatic stage at all and thus adiabaticity is broken. However, we show that there again exists a finite length scale arising from the driving that divides the evolution into three stages. A relaxation--finite-time scaling--adiabatic scenario is then proposed in place of the adiabatic--impulse--adiabatic scenario of the original Kibble-Zurek mechanism. A unified scaling theory, which combines finite-time scaling with critical initial slip, is developed to describe the universal behavior and is confirmed with numerical simulations of a two-dimensional classical Ising model.",1

Accuracy is achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to spatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced accuracy and precision are attained by fitting experimental coincidence data to curve simulated using measured source spectra. We employ bootstrapping statistics to quantify the resultant degree of precision. A scattershot approach is devised to effect a reduction in the experimental time required to characterize the interferometer.

69852,0,"Induced nuclear activity in galaxy pairs with different morphologies (E+E), (E+S) and (S+S) We analysed 385 galactic spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) that belong to the catalog of isolated pairs of galaxies by Karachentsev. The spectra corresponds to physical pairs of galaxies as defined by V $\leq$ 1200 Km/s and a pair separation $\leq$ 100 kpc. We search for the incidence of nuclear activity, both thermal (star-forming) and non-thermal -Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). After a careful extraction of the nuclear spectra, we use diagnostic diagrams and find that the incidence of AGN activity is 48 \% in the paired galaxies with emission lines and 40\% for the total sample (as compared to $\sim$ 43 \% and 41\% respectively in a sample of isolated galaxies). These results remain after dissecting the effects of morphological type and galactic stellar mass (with only a small, non significant, enhancement of the AGN fraction in pairs of objects). These results suggest that weak interactions are not necessary or sufficient to trigger low-luminosity AGN. Since the fraction of AGN is predominant in early type spiral galaxies, we conclude that the role of a bulge, and a large gas reservoir are both essential for the triggering of nuclear activity. The most striking result is that type 1 galaxies are almost absent from the AGN sample. This result is in conflict with the Unified Model, and suggests that high accretion rates are essential to form the Broad Line Region in active galaxies.",1

69912,0,"Scanning nano-spin ensemble microscope for nanoscale magnetic and thermal imaging Quantum sensors based on solid-state spins provide tremendous opportunities in a wide range of fields from basic physics and chemistry to biomedical imaging. However, integrating them into a scanning probe microscope to enable practical, nanoscale quantum imaging is a highly challenging task. Recently, the use of single spins in diamond in conjunction with atomic force microscopy techniques has allowed significant progress towards this goal, but generalisation of this approach has so far been impeded by long acquisition times or by the absence of simultaneous topographic information. Here we report on a scanning quantum probe microscope which solves both issues, by employing a nano-spin ensemble hosted in a nanodiamond. This approach provides up to an order of magnitude gain in acquisition time, whilst preserving sub-100 nm spatial resolution both for the quantum sensor and topographic images. We demonstrate two applications of this microscope. We first image nanoscale clusters of maghemite particles through both spin resonance spectroscopy and spin relaxometry, under ambient conditions. Our images reveal fast magnetic field fluctuations in addition to a static component, indicating the presence of both superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic particles. We next demonstrate a new imaging modality where the nano-spin ensemble is used as a thermometer. We use this technique to map the photo-induced heating generated by laser irradiation of a single gold nanoparticle in a fluid environment. This work paves the way towards new applications of quantum probe microscopy such as thermal/magnetic imaging of operating microelectronic devices and magnetic detection of ion channels in cell membranes.",1

70019,0,"Plasma surface dynamics and smoothing in the relativistic few-cycle regime In laser-plasma interactions it is widely accepted that a non-uniform interaction surface will invariably seed hydrodynamic instabilities and a growth in the amplitude of the initial modulation. Recent experimental results [Dromey, Nat. Phys. 2009] have demonstrated that there must be target smoothing in femtosecond timescale relativistic interactions, contrary to prevailing expectation. In this paper we develop a theoretical description of the physical process that underlies this novel phenomena. We show that the surface dynamics in the few-cycle relativistic regime is dominated by the coherent electron motion resulting in a smoothing of the electron surface. This stabilization of plasma surfaces is unique in laser-plasma interactions and demonstrates that dynamics in the few-cycle regime differ fundamentally from the longer pulse regimes. This has important consequences for applications such as radiation pressure acceleration of protons and ions and harmonic generation from relativistically oscillating surfaces.",1
70029,0,"In-N-Out: the gas cycle from dwarfs to spiral galaxies We examine the scalings of galactic outflows with halo mass across a suite of twenty high-resolution cosmological zoom galaxy simulations covering halo masses from 10^9.5 - 10^12 M_sun. These simulations self-consistently generate outflows from the available supernova energy in a manner that successfully reproduces key galaxy observables including the stellar mass-halo mass, Tully-Fisher, and mass-metallicity relations. We quantify the importance of ejective feedback to setting the stellar mass relative to the efficiency of gas accretion and star formation. Ejective feedback is increasingly important as galaxy mass decreases; we find an effective mass loading factor that scales as v_circ^(-2.2), with an amplitude and shape that is invariant with redshift. These scalings are consistent with analytic models for energy-driven wind, based solely on the halo potential. Recycling is common: about half the outflow mass across all galaxy masses is later re-accreted. The recycling timescale is typically about 1 Gyr, virtually independent of halo mass. Recycled material is re-accreted farther out in the disk and with typically about 2-3 times more angular momentum. These results elucidate and quantify how the baryon cycle plausibly regulates star formation and alters the angular momentum distribution of disk material across the halo mass range where most of cosmic star formation occurs.",1

70093,0,"Structured illumination microscopy image reconstruction algorithm Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a very important super-resolution microscopy technique, which provides high speed super-resolution with about two-fold spatial resolution enhancement. Several attempts aimed at improving the performance of SIM reconstruction algorithm have been reported.

In addition, most of the work reported lie scattered throughout the literature and a comprehensive review of the theoretical background is found lacking. The purpose of the present work is two-fold: 1) to collect the essential theoretical details of SIM algorithm at one place, thereby making them readily accessible to readers for the first time; and 2) to provide an open source SIM reconstruction code (named OpenSIM), which enables users to interactively vary the code parameters and study it's effect on reconstructed SIM image.",1

We also show that a connection and Higgs field on a Hermitian bundle are determined up to gauge by the knowledge of the parallel transport between boundary points along all possible geodesics. The main tools are an energy identity, the Pestov identity with a unitary connection, which is presented in a general form, and a precise analysis of the singularities of solutions of transport equations when there are trapped geodesics.

70347,0,"Masses and Scaling Relations for Nuclear Star Clusters, and their Coexistence with Central Black Holes Galactic nuclei typically host either a Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC, prevalent in galaxies with masses $\lesssim 10^{10}M_\odot$) or a Massive Black Hole (MBH, common in galaxies with masses $\gtrsim 10^{12}M_\odot$). In the intermediate mass range, some nuclei host both a NSC and a MBH. In this paper, we explore scaling relations between NSC mass (${\cal M}_{\rm NSC}$) and host galaxy total stellar mass (${\cal M}_{\star,\rm gal}$) using a large sample of NSCs in late- and early-type galaxies, including a number of NSCs harboring a MBH. Such scaling relations reflect the underlying physical mechanisms driving the formation and (co)evolution of these central massive objects. We find $\sim\!1.5\sigma$ significant differences between NSCs in late- and early-type galaxies in the slopes and offsets of the relations $r_{\rm eff,NSC}$--${\cal M}_{\rm NSC}$, $r_{\rm eff, NSC}$--${\cal M}_{\star,\rm gal}$ and ${\cal M}_{\rm NSC}$--${\cal M}_{\star,\rm gal}$, in the sense that $i)$ NSCs in late-types are more compact at fixed ${\cal M}_{\rm NSC}$ and ${\cal M}_{\star,\rm gal}$; and $ii)$ the ${\cal M}_{\rm NSC}$--${\cal M}_{\star,\rm gal}$ relation is shallower for NSCs in late-types than in early-types, similar to the ${\cal M}_{\rm BH}$--${\cal M}_{\star,\rm bulge}$ relation. We discuss these results in the context of the (possibly ongoing) evolution of NSCs, depending on host galaxy type. For NSCs with a MBH, we illustrate the possible influence of a MBH on its host NSC, by considering the ratio between the radius of the MBH sphere of influence and $r_{\rm eff, NSC}$. NSCs harbouring a sufficiently massive black hole are likely to exhibit surface brightness profile deviating from a typical King profile.",1
70515,0,"Flight of a heavy particle nonlinearly coupled to a quantum bath Fluctuation and dissipation are by-products of coupling to the `environment.' The Caldeira-Leggett model, a successful paradigm of quantum Brownian motion, views the environment as a collection of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to the system. However, symmetry considerations may forbid a linear coupling, e.g. for a neutral particle in quantum electrodynamics. We argue that nonlinear couplings can lead to a fundamentally different behavior. Specifically, we consider a heavy particle quadratically coupled to quantum fluctuations of the bath. In one dimension the particle undergoes anomalous diffusion, unfolding as a power-law distribution in space, reminiscent of L\'evy flights. We suggest condensed matter analogs where similar effects may arise.",1
70525,0,"Co-detection of acoustic emissions during failure of heterogeneous media: new perspectives for natural hazard early warning A promising method for real time early warning of gravity driven rupture that considers both the heterogeneity of natural media and characteristics of acoustic emissions attenuation is proposed. The method capitalizes on co-detection of elastic waves emanating from micro-cracks by multiple and spatially separated sensors. Event co-detection is considered as surrogate for large event size with more frequent co-detected events marking imminence of catastrophic failure. Using a spatially explicit fiber bundle numerical model with spatially correlated mechanical strength and two load redistribution rules, we constructed a range of mechanical failure scenarios and associated failure events (mapped into AE) in space and time. Analysis considering hypothetical arrays of sensors and consideration of signal attenuation demonstrate the potential of the co-detection principles even for insensitive sensors to provide early warning for imminent global failure.",1

The relative uncertainty for the transfer is below 1*10^{-19} after 30 000 seconds.

70684,0,"Kinematics of ICMEs/shocks: blast wave reconstruction using type II emissions We present a physical methodology to reconstruct the trajectory of interplanetary shocks using type II radio emission data. This technique calculates the shock trajectory assuming that the disturbance propagates as a blast wave in the interplanetary medium. We applied this Blast Wave Reconstruction (BWR) technique to analyze eight fast Earth-directed ICMEs/shocks associated with type II emissions. The technique deduces a shock trajectory that reproduces the type II frequency drifts, and calculates shock onset speed, shock transit time and shock speed at 1 AU. There were good agreements comparing the BWR results with the type II spectra, with data from coronagraph images, in situ measurements, and interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations. Perturbations on the type II data affect the accuracy of the BWR technique. This methodology could be applied to track interplanetary shocks causing TII emissions in real-time, to predict the shock arrival time and shock speed at 1 AU.",1
70733,0,"Monte Carlo model for electron degradation in xenon gas We have developed a Monte Carlo model for studying the local degradation of electrons in the energy range 9-10000 eV in xenon gas. Analytically fitted form of electron impact cross sections for elastic and various inelastic processes are fed as input data to the model. Two dimensional numerical yield spectrum, which gives information on the number of energy loss events occurring in a particular energy interval, is obtained as output of the model. Numerical yield spectrum is fitted analytically, thus obtaining analytical yield spectrum. The analytical yield spectrum can be used to calculate electron fluxes, which can be further employed for the calculation of volume production rates. Using yield spectrum, mean energy per ion pair and efficiencies of inelastic processes are calculated. The value for mean energy per ion pair for Xe is 22 eV at 10 keV. Ionization dominates for incident energies greater than 50 eV and is found to have an efficiency of 65% at 10 keV. The efficiency for the excitation process is 30% at 10 keV.",1

Here, we show that such a technique can also be utilized to increase the detection probability (DP) of a single waveguide-coupled photon. Based on a fully quantum mechanical theory in real space, we exactly calculated the absorption probability of a single photon for a two-level detector next to the waveguide. We find that the DP of the waveguide photon for the detector in a waveguide-coupled ring cavity is significantly higher than that for the bare detector directly coupled to the photon. Physically, the DP of the photon for the bare detector next to the waveguide is always limited by the finite transmission and reflection probabilities of the photon. The cavity technique is used to store the photon and thus increase its DP. The feasibility of the proposal with current integrated optical devices is then discussed.",1

In our approach, focusing and scanning through the fiber is accomplished by digital phase conjugation using mode selection by time gating with an ultra-fast reference pulse. The excited two-photon emission is collected through the same fiber.

71525,0,"The Metaphysics of D-CTCs: On the Underlying Assumptions of Deutsch's Quantum Solution to the Paradoxes of Time Travel I argue that Deutsch's model for the behavior of systems traveling around closed timelike curves (CTCs) relies implicitly on a substantive metaphysical assumption. Deutsch is employing a version of quantum theory with a significantly supplemented ontology of parallel existent worlds, which differ in kind from the many worlds of the Everett interpretation. Standard Everett does not support the existence of multiple identical copies of the world, which the D-CTC model requires. This has been obscured because he often refers to the branching structure of Everett as a ""multiverse"", and describes quantum interference by reference to parallel interacting definite worlds. But he admits that this is only an approximation to Everett. The D-CTC model, however, relies crucially on the existence of a multiverse of parallel interacting worlds. Since his model is supplemented by structures that go significantly beyond quantum theory, and play an ineliminable role in its predictions and explanations, it does not represent a quantum solution to the paradoxes of time travel.",1

Topological non-trivial bands characterized by non-zero Chern numbers are realized with external magnetic field induced time reversal symmetry breaking or dynamic modulation. Due to the absence of Faraday-like effect, the breaking of time reversal symmetry in an acoustic system is commonly realized with moving background fluids, and hence drastically increases the engineering complexity. Here we show that we can realize effective inversion symmetry breaking and effective gauge field in a reduced two-dimensional system by structurally engineering interlayer couplings, achieving an acoustic analog of the topological Haldane model.

In general, the galaxies presented here fill in the distribution for galaxies with lower stellar mass, M$_*$, specifically $\log({\rm M}_*/{\rm M}_\odot) &lt; 10$, overlap the results for early-type galaxies of similar masses, and, by doing so, strengthen the case for a dependence of the number of globular clusters per $10^9\ {\rm M}_\odot$ of galaxy stellar mass, T$_{\rm N}$, on M$_*$. For $8.5 &lt; \log ({\rm M}_*/{\rm M}_\odot) &lt; 10.5$ we find the relationship can be satisfactorily described as T$_{\rm N} = ({\rm M}_*/10^{6.7})^{-0.56}$ when M$_*$ is expressed in solar masses. The functional form of the relationship is only weakly constrained and extrapolation outside this range is not advised. Our late-type galaxies, in contrast to our early-types, do not show the tendency for low mass galaxies to split into two T$_{\rm N}$ families. Using these results and a galaxy stellar mass function from the literature, we calculate that in a volume limited, local Universe sample, clusters are most likely to be found around fairly massive galaxies (M$_* \sim 10^{10.8}$ M$_\odot$) and present a fitting function for the volume number density of clusters as a function of parent galaxy stellar mass.

72100,0,"Modelling supernova line profile asymmetries to determine ejecta dust masses: SN 1987A from days 714 to 3604 The late time optical and near-IR line profiles of many core-collapse supernovae exhibit a red-blue asymmetry as a result of greater extinction by internal dust of radiation emitted from the receding parts of the supernova ejecta. We present here a new code, DAMOCLES, that models the effects of dust on the line profiles of core-collapse supernovae in order to determine the masses of newly formed dust. As noted by Lucy et al. (1989), the presence of an extended red scattering wing in late-time line profiles can also indicate dust formation. We find that dust-affected line profiles need not necessarily be flux-biased towards to the blue, although the profile peak will always be blue-shifted. We have collated optical spectra of SN 1987A from a variety of archival sources and have modelled the evolution of the H$\alpha$ line from days 714 to 3604, as well as that of the [OI] 6300,6363A doublet between days 714 and 1478. A variety of evidence points to the presence of clumping and we find that our clumped dust models require significantly higher dust masses than smoothly distributed dust models. Our line profile fits imply day 714 dust masses of &lt;3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ for all grain types apart from very high albedo pure magnesium silicates, for which up to 0.07M$_{\odot}$ can be accommodated. Large grain radii (&gt;0.6$\mu$m) are generally required to fit the line profiles even at the earlier epochs. We find that a large dust mass (&gt;0.1M$_{\odot}$) had formed by day 3604 and infer that the majority of the present dust mass must have formed after this epoch. Our findings agree with recent estimates from SED fits for the dust mass evolution of SN 1987A and support the inference that the majority of SN 1987A's dust formed many years after the initial explosion.",1

With the development of built-in scanning probe microscopy imaging capabilities such as atomic force microscopy and indentation tip scanning probe microscopy, last generation indentation devices have made systematic residual imprint imaging much faster and more reliable. In this paper, a new post mortem method is introduced and further compared to three existing classical direct methods by means of a numerical and experimental benchmark covering a large range of materials.

We present a technique that allows the determination of stray-electric-field distributions $(F^\text{str}_\text{x}(\vec{r}),F^\text{str}_\text{y}(\vec{r}),F^\text{str}_\text{z}(\vec{r}))$ at distances of less than $2~\text{mm}$ from (cryogenic) surfaces using coherent Rydberg-Stark spectroscopy in a pulsed supersonic beam of metastable $1\text{s}^12\text{s}^1~{}^{1}S_{0}$ helium atoms. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by characterizing the electric stray field emanating from a structured superconducting surface. Exploiting coherent population transfer with microwave radiation from a coplanar waveguide, the same technique allows the characterization of the microwave-field distribution above the surface.",1
72787,0,"Probing Milky Way's hot gas halo density distribution using the dispersion measure of pulsars A number of recent studies indicates a significant amount of ionized gas in a form of the hot gas halo around the Milky Way. The halo extends over the region of 100 kpc and may be acountable for the missing baryon mass. In this paper we calculate the contribution of the proposed halo to the dispersion measure (DM) of the pulsars. The Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW), Maller &amp; Bullock (MB) and Feldmann, Hooper &amp; Gnedin (FHG) density distibutions are considered for the gas halo. The data set includes pulsars with the distance known independently from the DM, e.g. pulsars in globular clusters, LMC, SMC and pulsars with known parallax. The results exclude the NFW distribution for the hot gas, while the more realistic MB and FHG models are compatible with the observed dispersion measure.",1
72799,0,"Lossy chaotic electromagnetic reverberation chambers: Universal statistical behavior of the vectorial field The effective Hamiltonian formalism is extended to vectorial electromagnetic waves in order to describe statistical properties of the field in reverberation chambers. The latter are commonly used in electromagnetic compatibility tests. As a first step, the distribution of wave intensities in chaotic systems with varying opening in the weak coupling limit for scalar quantum waves is derived by means of random matrix theory. In this limit the only parameters are the modal overlap and the number of open channels. Using the extended effective Hamiltonian, we describe the intensity statistics of the vectorial electromagnetic eigenmodes of lossy reverberation chambers. Finally, the typical quantity of interest in such chambers, namely, the distribution of the electromagnetic response, is discussed. By determining the distribution of the phase rigidity, describing the coupling to the environment, using random matrix numerical data, we find good agreement between the theoretical prediction and numerical calculations of the response.",1
72845,0,"The environment of barred galaxies revisited We present a study of the environment of barred galaxies using galaxies drawn from the SDSS. We use several different statistics to quantify the environment: the projected two-point cross-correlation function, the background-subtracted number count of neighbor galaxies, the overdensity of the local environment, the membership of our galaxies to galaxy groups to segregate central and satellite systems, and for central galaxies we estimate the stellar to halo mass ratio (M$_{\mathrm{*}}/$M$_{\mathrm{h}}$) . When we split our sample into early- and late-type galaxies, we see a weak but significant trend for early-type galaxies with a bar to be more strongly clustered on scales from a few 100 kpc to 1 Mpc when compared to unbarred early-type galaxies. This indicates that the presence of a bar in early-type galaxies depends on the location within their host dark matter halos. This is confirmed by the group catalog in the sense that for early-types, the fraction of central galaxies is smaller if they have a bar. For late-type galaxies, we find fewer neighbors within $\sim50$ kpc around the barred galaxies when compared to unbarred galaxies from the control sample, suggesting that tidal forces from close companions suppress the formation/growth of bars. For central late-type galaxies, bars are more common on galaxies with high M$_{\mathrm{*}}/$M$_{\mathrm{h}}$ values, as expected from early theoretical works which showed that systems with massive dark matter halos are more stable against bar instabilities. Finally, we find no obvious correlation between overdensity and the bars in our sample, showing that galactic bars are not obviously linked to the large-scale structure of the universe.",1
72921,0,"First deep underground observation of rotational signals from an earthquake at teleseismic distance using a large ring laser gyroscope Recent advances in large ring laser gyroscopes (RLG) technologies opened the possibility to observe rotations of the ground with sensitivities up to $10^{-11}$ $\frac{rad}{s}$ over the frequency band of seismological interest (0.01-1Hz), thus opening the way to a new geophysical discipline, i.e. rotational seismology. A measure of rotations in seismology is of fundamental interest for (a) the determination of all the six degrees of freedom that characterize a rigid body motion, and (b) the quantitative estimate of the rotational motions contaminating ground translation measurements obtained from standard seismometers. Within this framework, this paper presents and describes GINGERino, a new large observatory-class RLG located in Gran Sasso underground laboratory (LNGS), one national laboratories of the INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). We also report unprecedented observations and analyses of the roto-translational signals from a tele-seismic event observed in such a deep underground environment.",1

First, we obtain a non-abelian localization theorem when M is any even dimensional compact manifold : following an idea of E. Witten, we deform an elliptic symbol associated to a Clifford bundle on M with a vector field associated to a moment map. Second, we use this general approach to reprove the [Q,R] = 0 theorem of Meinrenken-Sjamaar in the Hamiltonian case, and we obtain mild generalizations to almost complex manifolds. This non-abelian localization theorem can be used to obtain a geometric description of the multiplicities of the index of general spin^c Dirac operators (see preprint arXiv:1411.7772).",1

Calculations of the equilibrium configurations and IR spectra were carried out using the Gaussian program set in the approximation B3LYP/cc-pVDZ. It has been shown that typical bending of the poly-3-hydroxybutyrate chain is observed with an increase in the number of structural units. In order to explain the difference between the calculated and experimental frequencies of the C=O group stretching vibrations, the calculations of the potential energy curve associated with variations in the length of C=O bond and the subsequent numerical solution of a one-dimensional vibrational Schr\""odinger equation have been performed. The medium effects have been taken into account within the scope of a polarizable continuum model. Owing to the inclusion of the above-mentioned factors, which affect frequencies of the carbonyl groups stretching vibrations, correlation between the theoretical and experimental results has been improved significantly.",1
73238,0,"Component Based Modeling of Ultrasound Signals This work proposes a component based model for the raw ultrasound signals acquired by the transducer elements. Based on this approach, before undergoing the standard digital processing chain, every sampled raw signal is first decomposed into a smooth background signal and a strong reflectors component. The decomposition allows for a suited processing scheme to be adjusted for each component individually. We demonstrate the potential benefit of this approach in image enhancement by suppressing side lobe artifacts, and in improvement of digital data compression. Applying our proposed processing schemes to real cardiac ultrasound data, we show that by separating the two components and compressing them individually, over twenty-fold reduction of the data size is achieved while retaining the image contents.",1

We construct constant rest mass sequences by fulfilling all stability criteria of rotating configurations and show how the main structure of white dwarfs such as the central density, mean radius and angular velocity change with time. We explicitly demonstrate that all isolated white dwarfs regardless of their masses, by angular momentum loss, shrink and increase their central density. We also analyze the effects of the structure parameters on the evolution timescale both in the case of constant magnetic field and constant magnetic flux.",1

More accurate phase-sensitive signal gain spectra are obtained compared to the conventional 3-wave model, leading to the precise optimization of the pump configuration in a dual-pump PSA. The signal gain spectra, as well as the phase sensitivity, are obtained and interpreted by investigating the dominant FWM processes in terms of corresponding phase matching. Moreover, the relation between dispersion slope and gain spectra is revealed, permitting the application-oriented arbitrary tailoring of the gain spectra by manipulating the dispersion profile and pump wavelength allocation.",1
73358,0,"Adjoint Fokker-Planck equation and runaway electron dynamics The adjoint Fokker-Planck equation method is applied to study the runaway probability function and the expected slowing-down time for highly relativistic runaway electrons, including the loss of energy due to synchrotron radiation. In direct correspondence to Monte Carlo simulation methods, the runaway probability function has a smooth transition across the runaway separatrix, which can be attributed to effect of the pitch angle scattering term in the kinetic equation. However, for the same numerical accuracy, the adjoint method is more efficient than the Monte Carlo method. The expected slowing-down time gives a novel method to estimate the runaway current decay time in experiments. A new result from this work is that the decay rate of high energyelectrons is very slow when E is close to the critical electric field. This effect contributes further to a hysteresis previously found in the runaway electron population.",1

73393,0,"Advective and diffusive cosmic ray transport in galactic haloes We present 1D cosmic ray transport models, numerically solving equations of pure advection and diffusion for the electrons and calculating synchrotron emission spectra. We find that for exponential halo magnetic field distributions advection leads to approximately exponential radio continuum intensity profiles, whereas diffusion leads to profiles that can be better approximated by a Gaussian function. Accordingly, the vertical radio spectral profiles for advection are approximately linear, whereas for diffusion they are of `parabolic' shape. We compare our models with deep ATCA observations of two edge-on galaxies, NGC 7090 and 7462, at $\lambda\lambda$ 22 and 6 cm. Our result is that the cosmic ray transport in NGC 7090 is advection dominated with $V=150^{+80}_{-30}~\rm km\,s^{-1}$, and that the one in NGC 7462 is diffusion dominated with $D=3.0\pm 1.0 \times 10^{28}E_{\rm GeV}^{0.5}~\rm cm^2\,s^{-1}$. NGC 7090 has both a thin and thick radio disc with respective magnetic field scale heights of $h_{\rm B1}=0.8\pm 0.1$ kpc and $h_{\rm B2}=4.7\pm 1.0$ kpc. NGC 7462 has only a thick radio disc with $h_{\rm B2}=3.8\pm 1.0$ kpc. In both galaxies, the magnetic field scale heights are significantly smaller than what estimates from energy equipartition would suggest. A non-negligible fraction of cosmic ray electrons can escape from NGC 7090, so that this galaxy is not an electron calorimeter.",1

We are thus at the point where one can truly do quantum simulation of models that are relevant for instance in condensed-matter or high-energy physics, i.e. we are on the verge of a 'cool' quantum simulator as envisioned by Feynman. One of the avenues under exploration is the physics of one-dimensional systems. Until recently this was mostly in the many-body limit but now experiments can be performed with controllable particle numbers all the way down to the few-body regime.

73480,0,"Metric deformation and boundary value problems in 3D A novel perturbative method, proposed by Panda {\it et al.} [1] to solve the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions, is extended to three dimensions for general boundary surfaces. Although a few numerical works are available in the literature for specific domains in three dimensions such a general analytical prescription is presented for the first time. An appropriate transformation is used to get rid of the asymmetries in the domain boundary by mapping the boundary into an equivalent sphere with a deformed interior metric. The deformed metric produces new source terms in the original homogeneous equation. A deformation parameter measuring the deviation of the boundary from a spherical one is introduced as a perturbative parameter. With the help of standard Rayleigh-Schr{\""o}dinger perturbative technique the transformed equation is solved and the general solution is written down in a closed form at each order of perturbation. The solutions are boundary condition free and which make them widely applicable for various situations. Once the boundary conditions are applied to these general solutions the eigenvalues and the wavefunctions are obtained order by order. The efficacy of the method has been tested by comparing the analytic values against the numerical ones for three dimensional enclosures of various shapes. The method seems to work quite well for these shapes for both, Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions. The usage of spherical harmonics to express the asymmetries in the boundary surfaces helps us to consider a wide class of domains in three dimensions and also their fast convergence guarantees the convergence of the perturbative series for the energy. Direct applications of this method can be found in the field of quantum dots, nuclear physics, acoustical and electromagnetic cavities.",1
73486,0,"A search for white dwarfs in the Galactic plane: the field and the open cluster population We investigated the prospects for systematic searches of white dwarfs at low Galactic latitudes, using the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) H$\alpha$ Photometric Survey of the Galactic plane and Bulge (VPHAS+). We targeted 17 white dwarf candidates along sightlines of known open clusters, aiming to identify potential cluster members. We confirmed all the 17 white dwarf candidates from blue/optical spectroscopy, and we suggest five of them to be likely cluster members. We estimated progenitor ages and masses for the candidate cluster members, and compared our findings to those for other cluster white dwarfs. A white dwarf in NGC 3532 is the most massive known cluster member (1.13 M$_{\odot}$), likely with an oxygen-neon core, for which we estimate an $8.8_{-4.3}^{+1.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ progenitor, close to the mass-divide between white dwarf and neutron star progenitors. A cluster member in Ruprecht 131 is a magnetic white dwarf, whose progenitor mass exceeded 2-3 M$_{\odot}$. We stress that wider searches, and improved cluster distances and ages derived from data of the ESA Gaia mission, will advance the understanding of the mass-loss processes for low- to intermediate-mass stars.",1

These quasars lying in the redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 and having apparent V band magnitudes between 16.6 and 20.1 mag have observations ranging from 49 to 1353 epochs spanning over 7.5 years with frequency of sampling between 2 to 10 days. All the quasars show variability during the observing period. The normalized excess variance (Fvar) in V and R bands are in the range 0.2% &lt; Fvar &lt; 1.6% and 0.1% &lt; Fvar &lt; 1.5%. In a large fraction of the sources, Fvar is larger in the V-band compared to the R-band. From the z-transformed discrete cross correlation function analysis, we find that there is no lag between the V and R-band variations. Adopting the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, and properly taking into account the correlation between the errors in colours and magnitudes, it is found that majority of the sources show a bluer when brighter trend, while a minor fraction of quasars show the opposite behaviour. This is similar to the results obtained from other two independent algorithms namely the weighted linear least squares fit (FITEXY) and the bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter regression (BCES). However, the ordinary least squares (OLS) fit normally used in the colour variability studies of quasars, indicates that all the quasars studied here show a bluer when brighter trend. It is therefore very clear that OLS algorithm cannot be used for the study of colour variability in quasars.",1
73716,0,"Adaptive identification of coherent states We present methods for efficient characterization of an optical coherent state $|\alpha\rangle$. We choose measurement settings adaptively and stochastically, based on data while it is collected. Our algorithm divides the estimation into two distinct steps: (i) before the first detection of a vacuum state, the probability of choosing a measurement setting is proportional to detecting vacuum with the setting, which makes using too similar measurement settings twice unlikely; and (ii) after the first detection of vacuum, we focus measurements in the region where vacuum is most likely to be detected. In step (i) [(ii)] the detection of vacuum (a photon) has a significantly larger effect on the shape of the posterior probability distribution of $\alpha$. Compared to nonadaptive schemes, our method makes the number of measurement shots required to achieve a certain level of accuracy smaller approximately by a factor proportional to the area describing the initial uncertainty of $\alpha$ in phase space. While this algorithm is not directly robust against readout errors, we make it such by introducing repeated measurements in step (i).",1

73887,0,"Launching cosmic-ray-driven outflows from the magnetized interstellar medium We present a hydrodynamical simulation of the turbulent, magnetized, supernova (SN)-driven interstellar medium (ISM) in a stratified box that dynamically couples the injection and evolution of cosmic rays (CRs) and a self-consistent evolution of the chemical composition. CRs are treated as a relativistic fluid in the advection-diffusion approximation. The thermodynamic evolution of the gas is computed using a chemical network that follows the abundances of H+, H, H2, CO, C+, and free electrons and includes (self-)shielding of the gas and dust. We find that CRs perceptibly thicken the disk with the heights of 90% (70%) enclosed mass reaching ~1.5 kpc (~0.2 kpc). The simulations indicate that CRs alone can launch and sustain strong outflows of atomic and ionized gas with mass loading factors of order unity, even in solar neighborhood conditions and with a CR energy injection per SN of 10^50 erg, 10% of the fiducial thermal energy of an SN. The CR-driven outflows have moderate launching velocities close to the midplane (~100 km/s) and are denser (\rho~1e-24 - 1e-26 g/cm^3), smoother, and colder than the (thermal) SN-driven winds. The simulations support the importance of CRs for setting the vertical structure of the disk as well as the driving of winds.",1
74115,0,"Generation of longitudinal electric current by the transversal electromagnetic field in collisional plasma Kinetic Vlasov equation for collisional plasmas with BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) collision integral is used. The case of arbitrary temperature (i.e. arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas) is considered. From kinetic Vlasov equation the distribution function in square-law approximation on size of transversal electromagnetic field is received. The formula for calculation electric current is deduced. This formula contains one-dimension quadrature. It is shown, that the nonlinearity account leads to occurrence the longitudinal electric current directed along the wave vector. This longitudinal current is perpendicular to the known transversal classical current, received at the linear analysis. When frequency of collisions tends to zero, all received results for collisional plasma pass in known corresponding formulas for collisionless plasma. The case of small values of wave number is considered. It is shown, that the received quantity of longitudinal current at tendency of frequency of collisions to zero also passes in known corresponding expression of current for collisionless plasmas.

Molecular rotations are parameterized by the rotational quantum number $J$ which is considered in the range 1 to 151. The lowest four resonant states of O$_2^-$, $^2\Pi_g$, $^2\Pi_u$, $^4\Sigma_u^-$ and $^2\Sigma_u^-$, are taken into account.

However, the raw protein profiles suffer from several sources of bias or systematic variation which need to be removed via pre-processing before meaningful downstream analysis of the data can be undertaken. Baseline subtraction, an early pre-processing step that removes the non-peptide signal from the spectra, is complicated by the following: (i) each spectrum has, on average, wider peaks for peptides with higher mass-to-charge ratios (m/z), and (ii) the time-consuming and error-prone trial-and-error process for optimising the baseline subtraction input arguments. With reference to the aforementioned complications, we present an automated pipeline that includes (i) a novel `continuous' line segment algorithm that efficiently operates over data with a transformed m/z-axis to remove the relationship between peptide mass and peak width, and (ii) an input-free algorithm to estimate peak widths on the transformed m/z scale. The automated baseline subtraction method was deployed on six publicly available proteomic MS datasets using six different m/z-axis transformations. Optimality of the automated baseline subtraction pipeline was assessed quantitatively using the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) when compared to a gold-standard baseline subtracted signal. Near-optimal baseline subtraction was achieved using the automated pipeline. The advantages of the proposed pipeline include informed and data specific input arguments for baseline subtraction methods, the avoidance of time-intensive and subjective piecewise baseline subtraction, and the ability to automate baseline subtraction completely. Moreover, individual steps can be adopted as stand-alone routines.",1

74285,0,"Molecules and dust in Cassiopeia A: II - Dust sputtering and diagnosis of dust survival in supernova remnants We study the dust evolution in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. We follow the processing of dust grains that formed in the Type II-b supernova by modelling the sputtering of grains. The dust is located in dense ejecta clumps crossed by the reverse shock. Further sputtering in the inter-clump medium once the clumps are disrupted by the reverse shock is investigated. The dust evolution in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P supernovae and their remnants is also studied. We study oxygen-rich clumps that describe the ejecta oxygen core, and carbon-rich clumps that correspond to the outermost carbon-rich ejecta zone. We consider the dust components formed in the supernova, several reverse shock velocities and inter-clump gas temperatures, and derive dust grain size distributions and masses as a function of time. We find that non-thermal sputtering in clumps is important and accounts for reducing the grain population by ~ 40% to 80% in mass, depending on the clump gas over-density and the grain type and size. A Type II-b supernova forms small grains that are sputtered within clumps and in the inter-clump medium. For Cas A, silicate grains do not survive thermal sputtering in the inter-clump medium. Our derived masses of currently processed silicate, alumina and carbon grains in Cas A agree well with values derived from observations. Grains produced by Type II-P supernovae better survive the remnant phase. For dense ejecta clumps, dust survival efficiencies range between 42% and 98% in mass. For the SN1987A model, the derived surviving dust mass is in the range ~ 0.06-0.13 Msolar. This type of dense supernovae may efficiently provide galaxies with dust. Specifically, silicate grains over 0.1 micron and other grains over 0,05 micron survive thermal sputtering in the remnant. Therefore, pre-solar grains of supernova origin possibly form in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P supernovae.",1

74443,0,"Mutual information and spontaneous symmetry breaking We show that the metastable, symmetry-breaking ground states of quantum many-body Hamiltonians have vanishing quantum mutual information between macroscopically separated regions, and are thus the most classical ones among all possible quantum ground states. This statement is obvious only when the symmetry-breaking ground states are simple product states, e.g. at the factorization point. On the other hand, symmetry-breaking states are in general entangled along the entire ordered phase, and to show that they actually feature the least macroscopic correlations compared to their symmetric superpositions is highly non trivial. We prove this result in general, by considering the quantum mutual information based on the $2-$R\'enyi entanglement entropy and using a locality result stemming from quasi-adiabatic continuation. Moreover, in the paradigmatic case of the exactly solvable one-dimensional quantum $XY$ model, we further verify the general result by considering also the quantum mutual information based on the von Neumann entanglement entropy.",1

Numerical simulations are vital to their design and operation, but particle collisions are too infrequent for fluid descriptions to be valid. Instead, strongly magnetised fusion plasmas are described by the gyrokinetic equations, a nonlinear integro-differential system for evolving the particle distribution functions in a five-dimensional position and velocity space, and the consequent electromagnetic field. Due to the high dimensionality, simulations of small reactor sections require hundreds of thousands of CPU hours on High Performance Computing platforms. We develop a Hankel-Hermite spectral representation for velocity space that exploits structural features of the gyrokinetic system. The representation exactly conserves discrete free energy in the absence of explicit dissipation, while our Hermite hypercollision operator captures Landau damping with few variables. Calculation of the electromagnetic fields becomes purely local, eliminating inter-processor communication in, and vastly accelerating, searches for linear instabilities. We implement these ideas in SpectroGK, an efficient parallel code. Turbulent fusion plasmas may dissipate free energy through linear phase mixing to fine scales in velocity space, as in Landau damping, or through a nonlinear cascade to fine scales in physical space, as in hydrodynamic turbulence. Using SpectroGK to study saturated electrostatic drift-kinetic turbulence, we find that the nonlinear cascade suppresses linear phase mixing at energetically-dominant scales, so the turbulence is fluid-like. We use this observation to derive Fourier-Hermite spectra for the electrostatic potential and distribution function, and confirm these spectra with simulations.",1
74961,0,"Does the intermediate mass black hole in LEDA 87300 (RGG 118) follow the near-quadratic (M_bh)-(M_spheroid) relation? The mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host spheroids has previously been described by a quadratic or steeper relation at low masses (10^5 &lt; M_bh/M_sun &lt; 10^7). How this extends into the realm of intermediate mass black holes (10^2 &lt; M_bh/M_sun &lt; 10^5) is not yet clear, although for the barred Sm galaxy LEDA 87300, Baldassare et al. have recently reported a nominal virial mass M_bh=5x10^4 M_sun residing in a `spheroid' of stellar mass equal to 6.3x10^8 M_sun. We point out, for the first time, that LEDA 87300 therefore appears to reside on the near-quadratic M_bh-M_{sph,*} relation. However, Baldassare et al. modelled the bulge _and_ bar as the single spheroidal component of this galaxy. Here we perform a 3-component bulge+bar+disk decomposition and find a bulge luminosity which is 7.7 times fainter than the published `bulge' luminosity. After correcting for dust we find that M_bulge=0.9x10^8 M_sun, and M_bulge/M_disk=0.04 - which is now in accord with ratios typically found in Scd-Sm galaxies. We go on to discuss slight revisions to the stellar velocity dispersion (40+/-11 km/s) and black hole mass (M_bh=2.9x10^4 M_sun) and show that LEDA 87300 remains consistent with both the M_bh-sigma relation and the near-quadratic M_bh-M_{sph,*} relation when using the reduced bulge mass. LEDA 87300 therefore offers the first support for the rapid but regulated (near-quadratic) growth of black holes, relative to their host bulge/spheroid, extending into the domain of intermediate mass black holes.",1

Furthermore, the generating function for mixed products of Laguerre 2D and Hermite 2D polynomials and for products of two Hermite 2D polynomials is calculated. A set of infinite sums over products of two Laguerre 2D polynomials as intermediate step to the generating function for products of Laguerre 2D polynomials is evaluated but these sums possess also proper importance for calculations with Laguerre polynomials.

Details of the clustering properties of star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2$ We present the results of clustering analysis on the $z \sim 2$ star-forming galaxies. By combining our data with data from publicly available archives, we collect $g$-, $\zb / z$-, and $K$-band imaging data over 5.2 deg$^{2}$, which represents the largest area BzK/gzK survey. We apply colour corrections to translate our filter-set to those used in the original BzK selection for the gzK selection. Because of the wide survey area, we obtain a sample of 41,112 star-forming gzK galaxies at $z \sim 2$ (sgzKs) down to $\KAB &lt; 23.0$, and determine high-quality two-point angular correlation functions (ACFs). Our ACFs show an apparent excess from power-law behaviour at small angular scale $(\theta \la 0.01^{\circ})$, which corresponds the virial radius of a dark halo at $z \sim 2$ with a mass of $\sim 10^{13} \Msun$. We find that the correlation lengths are consistent with the previous estimates over all magnitude range; however, our results are evaluated with a smaller margin of error than that in previous studies. The large amount of data enables us to determine ACFs differentially depending on the luminosity of the subset of the data. The mean halo mass of faint sgzKs $(22.0 &lt; K \leq 23.0)$ was found to be $\Mh = (1.32^{+0.09}_{-0.12}) \times 10^{12} h^{-1} \Msun$, whereas bright sgzKs ($18.0 \leq K \leq 21.0)$ were found to reside in dark haloes with a mass of $\Mh = (3.26^{+1.23}_{-1.02}) \times 10^{13} h^{-1} \Msun$.",1

The disk is formed due to large specific angular momentum of the accreted mass. The two opposite jets might expel some of the mass from the reservoir of gas that feeds the disk, and therefore reduces and shortens the mass accretion process. We argue that by this process ILOTs limit their luminosity and might even shut themselves off in this negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). The group of ILOTs is a new member of a large family of astrophysical objects whose activity is regulated by the operation of the JFM.",1
75582,0,"Nonzero temperature Entanglement Negativity of quantum spin models: Area law, Linked Cluster Expansions and Sudden Death We show that the bipartite logarithmic entanglement negativity (EN) of quantum spin models obeys an area law at all nonzero temperatures. We develop numerical linked cluster (NLC) expansions for the `area-law' logarithmic entanglement negativity as a function of temperature and other parameters. For one-dimensional models the results of NLC are compared with exact diagonalization on finite systems and are found to agree very well. The NLC results are also obtained for two dimensional XXZ and transverse-field Ising models. In all cases, we find a sudden onset (or sudden death) of negativity at a finite temperature above which the negativity is zero. We use perturbation theory to develop a physical picture for this sudden onset (or sudden death). The onset of EN or its magnitude are insensitive to classical finite-temperature phase transitions, supporting the argument for absence of any role of quantum mechanics at such transitions. On approach to a quantum critical point at $T=0$, negativity shows critical scaling in size and temperature.",1

75734,0,"Reverse Monte Carlo investigations concerning recent isotopic substitution neutron diffraction data on liquid water Although liquid water has been studied for many decades by (X-ray and neutron) diffraction measurements, new experimental results keep appearing, virtually every year. The reason for this is that neither X-ray, nor neutron diffraction data are trivial to correct and interpret for this essential substance. Since X-rays are somewhat insensitive to hydrogen, neutron diffraction with (most frequently, H/D) isotopic substitution is vital for investigating the most important feature in water: hydrogen bonding. Here, the two very recent sets of neutron diffraction data are considered, both exploiting the contrast between light and heavy hydrogen, $^1$H and $^2$H, in different ways. Reverse Monte Carlo structural modeling is applied for constructing large structural models that are as consistent as possible with all experimental information, both in real and reciprocal space. The method has also proven to be useful for revealing where possible small inconsistencies appear during primary data processing: for one neutron data set, it is the molecular geometry that may not be maintained within reasonable limits, whereas for the other set, it is one of the (composite) radial distribution functions that cannot be modeled at the same (high) level as the other three functions. Nevertheless, details of the local structure around the hydrogen bonds appear very much the same for both data sets: the most probable hydrogen bond angle is straight, and the nearest oxygen neighbours of a central oxygen atom occupy approximately tetrahedral positions.",1

75913,0,"Adiabatic black hole growth in S\'ersic models of elliptical galaxies We have examined the effect of slow growth of a central black hole on spherical galaxies that obey S\'ersic or $R^{1/m}$ surface-brightness profiles. During such growth the actions of each stellar orbit are conserved, which allows us to compute the final distribution function if we assume that the initial distribution function is isotropic. We find that black-hole growth leads to a central cusp or ``excess light', in which the surface brightness varies with radius as $R^{-1.3}$ (with a weak dependence on S\'ersic index $m$), the line-of-sight velocity dispersion varies as $R^{-1/2}$, and the velocity anisotropy is $\beta\simeq -0.24$ to $-0.28$ depending on $m$. The excess stellar mass in the cusp scales approximately linearly with the black-hole mass, and is typically 0.5--0.85 times the black-hole mass. This process may strongly influence the structure of nuclear star clusters if they contain black holes.",1
75957,0,"Multiwavelength study of twenty jets emanating from the periphery of active regions We present a multiwavelength analysis of 20 EUV jets which occurred at the periphery of active regions close to sunspots. We discuss the physical parameters of the jets and their relation with other phenomena such as H alpha surges, nonthermal type III radio bursts and hard X-ray emission. Using AIA wavelength channels sensitive to coronal temperatures, we studied the temperature distribution in the jets using the line-of-sight Differential Emission Measure technique. We also investigated the role of the photospheric magnetic field using the LOS magnetogram data from the HMI. The lifetime of jets range from 5 to 39 minutes with an average of 18 minutes and their velocities range from 87 to 532 km/s with an average of 271 km/s. Most of the jets are co-temporal with nonthermal type III radio bursts observed by the Wind/WAVES spacecraft. We confirm the source region of these bursts using the Potential Field Source Surface technique. 10 out of 20 events showed that the jets originated in a region of flux cancellation and 6 jets in a region of flux emergence. 4 events showed flux emergence and then cancellation during the jet evolution. DEM analyses showed that for most of the spires of the jets, the DEM peaked at around log T [K] = 6.2/6.3. In addition, we derived an emission measure and a lower limit of electron density at the location of the spire and the footpoint. These results are in agreement with those obtained earlier by studying individual active region jets. The observation of flux cancellation, the association with HXR emission and emission of nonthermal type III radio bursts, suggest that the initiation and therefore, heating is taking place at the base of the jet. This is also supported by the high temperature plasma revealed by the DEM analysis in the jet footpoint. Our results provide substantial constraints for theoretical modeling of the jets and their thermodynamic nature.",1

The technique is based on the defocused image analysis of both spherical particles and their binary agglomerates.

Below this critical diameter, the particle size has been measured using the rotational interference fringe patterns which appear only on the defocused images of binary agglomerates. In this case, a lower cut-off limit of particle diameter has been predicted, below which no such rotational fringe patterns are observed for the binary agglomerates. The method can be useful as a diagnostics for complex plasma experiments on earth as well as under microgravity condition.",1
76399,0,"Mass ejection by pulsational pair instability in very massive stars and implications for luminous supernovae Massive stars having a CO core of $\sim$40-60 M$_\odot$ experience pulsational pair-instability (PPI) after carbon-burning. This instability induces strong pulsations of the whole star and a part of outer envelope is ejected. We investigate the evolution and mass ejection of metal-poor very massive stars which experience PPI. We use stellar models with initial masses of 140, 200, and 250 M$_\odot$ and the metallicity Z=0.004. Their masses decrease to 54.09, 58.65, and 61.03 M$_\odot$ before the neon-burning owing to mass-loss and He mass fraction at the surface becomes about 20%. During the PPI period of $\sim$1-2000 yr, they experience six, four, and three pulsations, respectively. The larger CO-core model has the longer PPI period and ejects the larger amount of mass. Since almost all surface He has been lost by the pulsations, these stars become Type Ic supernovae if they explode. Light curves during the PPI stage and supernovae are investigated and are implicated in luminous supernovae. The luminosity created by the interaction of different PPI ejecta becomes $M_{\rm bol} \sim -16$ to $-20$. The interaction between the circumstellar shell ejected by PPI and the supernova ejecta can be more luminous. These luminous transients could be an origin of Type I superluminous supernovae and supernovae with precursor.",1

For a sufficiently weak inter-cavity photon hopping, as the photon-cavity coupling increases, the dynamics undergoes double transitions first from a delocalized to a localized phase and then from the localized to another delocalized phase. The latter delocalized phase is distinguished from the former one; instead of oscillating between the two cavities, the photons rapidly quasi-equilibrate over the two cavities.

Here, we demonstrate an entirely new approach to positional and directional sensing based on the concept of classical entanglement in vector beams of light. The measurement principle relies on the intrinsic correlations existing in such beams between transverse spatial modes and polarization. The latter can be determined from intensity measurements with only a few fast photodiodes, greatly outperforming the bandwidth of current CCD/CMOS devices. In this way, our setup enables two-dimensional real-time sensing with temporal resolution in the GHz range.

76578,0,"The Growth and Enrichment of the Intragroup Gas The thermal and chemical properties of the hot diffuse intragroup medium (IGrM) provide important constraints on the feedback processes associated with massive galaxy formation and evolution. Here we explore these constraints via a detailed analysis of the global properties of simulated z&lt;3 galaxy groups from a cosmological simulation that includes a well-constrained prescription for stellar/supernovae-powered galactic outflows but no AGN feedback. Our aims are to (a) establish a baseline against which we will compare future models; (b) identify model successes due to stellar/supernovae-powered outflows; and (c) pinpoint features that signal the need for, and constrain the nature of, AGN feedback. Our simulation successfully reproduces key observed z=0 group IGrM properties, including the various X-ray Lx - Tx - entropy scaling relations, for all but the most massive groups. The z&lt;1 redshift evolution of these also agree with observations. Contrary to expectations, the simulated groups' IGrM does not suffer catastrophic cooling. Yet, the z=0 group stellar mass is ~ 2X too large. This is due to the build-up of cold gas in the massive galaxies before they are incorporated inside groups. This in turn indicates that other feedback mechanisms must activate in real galaxies once their stellar masses grow to a few X 10^{10} M_sun. We show that these must be powerful enough to expel a significant fraction of the gas from the galactic halos. Gentle maintenance-mode (quenching) AGN feedback, as seen in galaxy clusters, will not do. Just as importantly, we find that the stellar/supernovae-powered winds are essential for understanding the IGrM metal abundances. Our simulation is able to reproduce the observed relationship between the global IGrM iron and silicon abundance and the group X-ray temperature, and these results ought to be relatively insensitive to the addition of AGN feedback.",1
76647,0,"Electron heating via the self-excited plasma series resonance in geometrically symmetric multi-frequency capacitive plasmas The self-excitation of Plasma Series Resonance (PSR) oscillations plays an important role in the electron heating dynamics in Capacitively Coupled Radio Frequency (CCRF) plasmas. In a combined approach of PIC/MCC simulations and a theoretical model based on an equivalent circuit, we investigate the self-excitation of PSR oscillations and their effect on the electron heating in geometrically symmetric CCRF plasmas driven by multiple consecutive harmonics. The discharge symmetry is controlled via the Electrical Asymmetry Effect, i.e. by varying the total number of harmonics and tuning the phase shifts between them. It is demonstrated that PSR oscillations will be self-excited under both symmetric and asymmetric conditions, if (i) the charge-voltage relation of the plasma sheaths deviates from a simple quadratic behavior and if (ii) the inductance of the plasma bulk exhibits a temporal modulation. These two effects have been neglected up to now, but we show that they must be included in the model in order to properly describe the nonlinear series resonance circuit and reproduce the self-excitation of PSR oscillations, which are observed in the electron current density resulting from simulations of geometrically symmetric CCRF plasmas. Furthermore, the effect of the PSR self-excitation on the discharge current and the plasma properties, such as the potential profile, is illustrated by applying Fourier analysis. High frequency oscillations in the entire spectrum between the applied frequencies and the local electron plasma frequency are observed. As a consequence, the electron heating is strongly enhanced by the presence of PSR oscillations.",1

77120,0,"Disentangling the ICL with the CHEFs: Abell 2744 as a case study Measurements of the intracluster light (ICL) are still prone to methodological ambiguities and there are multiple techniques in the literature for that purpose, mostly based on the binding energy, the local density distribution, or the surface brightness. A common issue with these methods is the a priori assumption of a number of hypotheses on either the ICL morphology, its surface brightness level or some properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The discrepancy on the results is high, and numerical simulations just bound the ICL fraction in present-day galaxy clusters to the range 10-50%. We developed a new algorithm based on the Chebyshev-Fourier functions (CHEFs) to estimate the ICL fraction without relying on any a priori assumption on the physical or geometrical characteristics of the ICL. We are able to not only disentangle the ICL from the galatic luminosity but mark out the limits of the BCG from the ICL in a natural way. We test our tecnique with the recently released data of the cluster Abell 2744, observed by the Frontier Fields program. The complexity of this multiple merging cluster system and the formidable depth of these images make it a challenging test case to prove the efficiency of our algorithm.

Adapting a dynamical decoupling scheme that allows for extending $T_2$ by orders of magnitude and merging it with a magnetic sensing protocol, we achieve a measurement sensitivity even for high frequency fields close to the standard quantum limit. Using a single atomic ion as a sensor, we experimentally attain a sensitivity of $4.6$ pT $/\sqrt{Hz}$ for an alternating-current magnetic field near 14 MHz.

On-resonance artificial divergences of the latter found in lowest-order perturbation theory in the two-particle interaction are consistently removed. Away from resonance they are shifted to higher orders. This allows us to gain a comprehensive picture of the current noise in the scaling limit. At high bias voltages, the current noise exhibits a universal power-law decay, whose exponent is to leading order in the interaction identical to that of the current. The effective charge on resonance is analyzed in detail employing properties of the vertex correction. We find that it is only modified to second or higher order in the two-particle interaction.",1
77848,0,"On the self-excitation mechanisms of Plasma Series Resonance oscillations in single- and multi-frequency capacitive discharges The self-excitation of plasma series resonance (PSR) oscillations is a prominent feature in the current of low pressure capacitive radio frequency (RF) discharges. This resonance leads to high frequency oscillations of the charge in the sheaths and enhances electron heating. Up to now, the phenomenon has only been observed in asymmetric discharges. There, the nonlinearity in the voltage balance, which is necessary for the self-excitation of resonance oscillations with frequencies above the applied frequencies, is caused predominantly by the quadratic contribution to the charge-voltage relation of the plasma sheaths. Using PIC/MCC simulations of single- and multi- frequency capacitive discharges and an equivalent circuit model, we demonstrate that other mechanisms such as a cubic contribution to the charge-voltage relation of the plasma sheaths and the time dependent bulk electron plasma frequency can cause the self-excitation of PSR oscillations, as well. These mechanisms have been neglected in previous models, but are important for the theoretical description of the current in symmetric or weakly asymmetric discharges.",1
77866,0,"Overlap distributions for quantum quenches in the anisotropic Heisenberg chain The dynamics after a quantum quench is determined by the weights of the initial state in the eigenspectrum of the final Hamiltonian, i.e., by the distribution of overlaps in the energy spectrum. We present an analysis of such overlap distributions for quenches of the anisotropy parameter in the one-dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model (XXZ chain). We provide an overview of the form of the overlap distribution for quenches from various initial anisotropies to various final ones, using numerical exact diagonalization. We show that if the system is prepared in the antiferromagnetic N\'eel state (infinite anisotropy) and released into a non-interacting setup (zero anisotropy, XX point) only a small fraction of the final eigenstates gives contributions to the post-quench dynamics, and that these eigenstates have identical overlap magnitudes. We derive expressions for the overlaps, and present the selection rules that determine the final eigenstates having nonzero overlap. We use these results to derive concise expressions for time-dependent quantities (Loschmidt echo, longitudinal and transverse correlators) after the quench. We use perturbative analyses to understand the overlap distribution for quenches from infinite to small nonzero anisotropies, and for quenches from large to zero anisotropy.",1

We show that the claimed [O III] variations are merely the result of random errors in the overall flux calibration of the spectra. The data do not provide any support for the hypothesis that the [O III] flux was variable during the 2008 monitoring period.",1

Section series imaged with Electron Microscopy are currently vital for the reconstruction of the synaptic connectivity of entire animal brains such as that of Drosophila melanogaster. The process of removing ultrathin layers from a solid block containing the specimen, however, is a fragile procedure and has limited precision with respect to section thickness. We have developed a method to estimate the relative z-position of each individual section as a function of signal change across the section series. First experiments show promising results on both serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) data and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) series. We made our solution available as Open Source plugins for the TrakEM2 software and the ImageJ distribution Fiji.",1
78018,0,"X-ray long-term variations in the low-luminosity AGN NGC835 and its circumnuclear emission Obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to be very common in the Universe. Observations and surveys have shown that the number of sources increases for near galaxies and at the low-luminosity regime (the so-called LLAGNs). Furthermore, many AGNs show changes in their obscuration properties at X-rays that may suggest a configuration of clouds very close to the accretion disk. However, these variations could also be due to changes in the intrinsic continuum of the source. It is therefore important to study nearby AGN to better understand the locus and distribution of clouds in the neighbourhood of the nucleus. We aim to study the nuclear obscuration of LLAGN NGC835 and its extended emission using mid-infrared observations. We present mid-infrared 11.5 microns imaging of the LLAGN galaxy NGC835 obtained with the instrument CanariCam in the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), archival Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy, and archival Chandra data observed in 2000, 2008, and 2013. The GTC/CanariCam 11.5 microns image reveals faint extended emission out to ~6 arcsec. We obtained a nuclear flux of F(11.5 microns) ~18 mJy, whereas the extended emission accounts for 90% of the total flux within the 6 arcsec. This means that the low angular resolution (~4 arcsec) IRS spectrum is dominated by this extended emission and not by the AGN, clearly seen in the Spitzer/IRS spectrum. Although the extended soft X-ray emission shows some resemblance with that of the mid-infrared, the knots seen at X-rays are mostly located in the inner side of this mid-infrared emission. The nuclear X-ray spectrum of the source has undergone a spectral change between 2000/2008 and 2013. We argue that this is most probably due to changes in the hydrogen column density from ~ 8x10E+23 cm-2 to ~ 3x10E+23 cm-2. NGC835 therefore is one of the few LLAGN, together with NGC1052, in which changes in the absorber can be claimed.",1
78135,0,"Time and Frequency Injection into a Stabilized Fiber Link for Multi-clock Dissemination Network Owing to the characteristics of ultra-low loss and anti-electromagnetic interference, using optical fiber to deliver time and frequency signal has been a preferred choice for high precise clock dissemination and comparison. As a brilliant idea, one has been able to reproduce ultra-stable signals from one local station to multiple users. In this paper, we take a step further. A concept of multi-clock (in different locations) dissemination for multi-terminals is presented. By injecting frequency signals into one stabilized ring-like fiber network, the relative stabilities of 3.4e-14@1s for a master clock dissemination and 5.1e-14@1s for a slave clock dissemination have been achieved. The proposed scheme can greatly simplify the future 'N' to 'N' time and frequency dissemination network, especially facing a multi-clock comparison situation.",1
78298,0,"Bulk Topological Proximity Effect Existing proximity effects stem from systems with a local order parameter, such as a local magnetic moment or a local superconducting pairing amplitude. Here, we demonstrate that despite lacking a local order parameter, topological phases also may give rise to a proximity effect of a distinctively inverted nature. We focus on a general construction in which a topological phase is extensively coupled to a second system, and we argue that in many cases, the inverse topological order will be induced on the second system. To support our arguments, we rigorously establish this ""bulk topological proximity effect"" for all gapped free fermion topological phases and representative integrable models of interacting topological phases. We present a terrace construction which illustrates the phenomenological consequences of this proximity effect. Finally, we discuss generalizations beyond our framework, including how intrinsic topological order may also exhibit this effect.",1

In this work we study the properties of the one-dimensional chain of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states induced by magnetic impurities using a realistic model for the magnetic atoms that include the presence of multiple scattering channels. These channels are mixed by the spin-orbit coupling and, via the hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states at different sites of the chain, result in a multi-band structure for the chain. We obtain the topological phase diagram for such band structure. We identify the parameter regimes for which the different bands lead to a topological phase and show that the inclusion of higher bands can greatly enlarge the phase space for the realization of topological states.",1

We find that both codes are heavily optimized to leverage the computational potential of GPUs as their performance has approached half of the maximum single precision performance of the underlying GPU cards. With such performance we predict that a speed-up of $200-300$ can be achieved when up to 1k processors and GPUs are employed simultaneously. We discuss the quantitative information about comparisons of two codes, finding that in the same cases Bonsai adopts larger time steps as well as relative energy errors than NBODY6++, typically ranging from $10-50$ times larger, depending on the chosen parameters of the codes. While the two codes are built for different astrophysical applications, in specified conditions they may overlap in performance at certain physical scale, and thus allowing the user to choose from either one with finetuned parameters accordingly.",1

78853,0,"Bell's theorem and the measurement problem: reducing two mysteries to one? In light of a recent reformulation of Bell's theorem from causal principles by Howard Wiseman and the author, I argue that the conflict between quantum theory and relativity brought up by Bell's work can be softened by a revision of our classical notions of causation. I review some recent proposals for a quantum theory of causation that make great strides towards that end, but highlight a property that is shared by all those theories that would not have satisfied Bell's realist inclinations. They require (implicitly or explicitly) agent-centric notions such as ""controllables"" and ""uncontrollables"", or ""observed"" and ""unobserved"". Thus they relieve the tensions around Bell's theorem by highlighting an issue more often associated with another deep conceptual issue in quantum theory: the measurement problem. Rather than rejecting those terms, however, I argue that we should understand why they seem to be, at least at face-value, needed in order to reach compatibility between quantum theory and relativity. This seems to suggest that causation, and thus causal structure, are emergent phenomena, and lends support to the idea that a resolution of the conflict between quantum theory and relativity necessitates a solution to the measurement problem.",1

According to the $M_{500}-T$ and $L_{\rm X}-T$ relations, the gas properties of FSs are not physically distinct from ordinary galaxy groups or clusters. We also first study the $f_{\rm gas,~2500}-T$ relation and find that the FS exhibits same as ordinary systems. The gas densities of FSs within $0.1r_{200}$, are $\sim 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, which is the same order as galaxy clusters. The entropies within $0.1r_{200}$ ($S_{0.1r_{200}}$) of FSs are systematically lower than those in ordinary galaxy groups which is consistent with previous report, but we find their $S_{0.1r_{200}}-T$ relation is more similar to galaxy clusters. The derived mass profiles of FSs are consistent with the Navarro, Frenk, \&amp; White model in $(0.1-1)r_{200}$, and the relation between scale radius $r_{\rm s}$ and characteristic mass density $ta_{\rm c}$ indicates the self-similarity of dark matter halos of FSs. The range of $r_{\rm s}$ and $ta_{\rm c}$ of FSs are also close to those of galaxy clusters. Therefore, FSs share more common characteristics with galaxy clusters.

In this communication is described a major improvement of the technique, where the achromatization process is extended to the entire fringe pattern. Therefore higher Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and appreciable simplification of the detection system should result.

We find a positive magnetic conductivity for the long-range disorder, although the system tends to have negative magnetic conductivity for the weak short-range disorder. Remarkably, for long-range disorder, such a positive magnetic conductivity cannot be described by the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory even in the weak disorder limit, and the back-scattering assisted by the high Landau levels is always important. Our results have significant implications for the positive magnetic conductivity recently discovered in the WSM systems, and point out two physical mechanisms: (i) the long-range correlated disorder suppresses the back-scattering among the zeroth Landau level modes; (ii) with increasing the magnetic field, the back-scattering assisted by the high Landau levels will also be suppressed.",1

79058,0,"Modular Dynamical Semigroups for Quantum Dissipative Systems We introduce a class of Markovian quantum master equations, able to describe the dissipative dynamics of a quantum system weakly coupled to one or several heat baths. The dissipative structure is driven by an entropic operator, the so called modular Hamiltonian, which makes it nonlinear. The generated Modular Dynamical Semigroup (MDS) is not, in general, a Quantum Dynamical Semigroup (QDS), whose dynamics is of the popular Lindblad type. The MDS has a robust thermodynamic structure, which guarantees for the positivity of the time evolved state, the correct steady state properties, the positivity of the entropy production, a positive Onsager matrix and Onsager symmetry relations (arising from Green-Kubo formulas). We show that the celebrated Davies generator, obtained through the Born and the secular approximations, generates a MDS. By unravelling the modular structure of the former, we provide a different and genuinely nonlinear MDS, not of QDS type, which is free from the severe spectral restrictions of the Davies generator, while still being supported by a weak coupling limit argument.

79097,0,"A Remarkably Luminous Galaxy at z=11.1 Measured with Hubble Space Telescope Grism Spectroscopy We present Hubble WFC3/IR slitless grism spectra of a remarkably bright $z\gtrsim10$ galaxy candidate, GN-z11, identified initially from CANDELS/GOODS-N imaging data. A significant spectroscopic continuum break is detected at $\lambda=1.47\pm0.01~\mu$m. The new grism data, combined with the photometric data, rule out all plausible lower redshift solutions for this source. The only viable solution is that this continuum break is the Ly$\alpha$ break redshifted to ${z_\mathrm{grism}=11.09^{+0.08}_{-0.12}}$, just $\sim$400 Myr after the Big Bang. This observation extends the current spectroscopic frontier by 150 Myr to well before the Planck (instantaneous) cosmic reionization peak at z~8.8, demonstrating that galaxy build-up was well underway early in the reionization epoch at z&gt;10. GN-z11 is remarkably and unexpectedly luminous for a galaxy at such an early time: its UV luminosity is 3x larger than L* measured at z~6-8. The Spitzer IRAC detections up to 4.5 $\mu$m of this galaxy are consistent with a stellar mass of ${\sim10^{9}~M_\odot}$. This spectroscopic redshift measurement suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to similarly and easily confirm such sources at z&gt;10 and characterize their physical properties through detailed spectroscopy.

By comparing energy difference between different parity quantum numbers, the LS method is a crucial technique used in identifying quantum critical points of Gaussian and Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type quantum phase transitions. These transitions that occur in many one-dimensional systems are usually difficult to study numerically. Although the LS method is an effective strategy to locate critical points, it has been lacked an algorithm that can manage large systems with parity quantum numbers. Here a new parity Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm is discussed. The LS method is the first time performed by DMRG in the S=2 XXZ spin chain with uniaxial anisotropy. Quantum critical points of BKT and Gaussian transitions can be located well. Thus, the LS method becomes a very powerful tool for BKT and Gaussian transitions.

We describe in detail our implementation of the polyphase filter algorithm and its behaviour on three generations of NVIDIA GPU cards, on dual Intel Xeon CPUs and the Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Corner) platforms. All of our implementations aim to exploit the potential for data reuse that the algorithm offers. Our GPU implementations explore two different methods for achieving this, the first makes use of L1/Texture cache, the second uses shared memory. We discuss the usability of each of our implementations along with their behaviours. We measure performance in execution time, which is a critical factor for real-time systems, we also present results in terms of bandwidth (GB/s), compute (GFlop/s) and type conversions (GTc/s). We include a presentation of our results in terms of the sample rate which can be processed in real-time by a chosen platform, which more intuitively describes the expected performance in a signal processing setting. Our findings show that, for the GPUs considered, the performance of our polyphase filter when using lower precision input data is limited by type conversions rather than device bandwidth. We compare these results to an implementation on the Xeon Phi. We show that our Xeon Phi implementation has a performance that is 1.47x to 1.95x greater than our CPU implementation, however is not insufficient to compete with the performance of GPUs. We conclude with a comparison of our best performing code to two other implementations of the polyphase filter, showing that our implementation is faster in nearly all cases.

We introduce a novel three-dimensionally folded variant of the typical planar bow-tie resonator geometry that guarantees circular beam profiles, maintains linear polarization, and allows for a significantly tighter focus as well as a larger beam cross-section on the cavity mirrors. The scheme is applied to improve focusing in a Ti:Sapphire based VUV frequency comb system, targeting the 5th harmonic around 160 nm (7.8 eV) towards high-precision spectroscopy of the low-energy isomer state of Thorium-229.

80023,0,"Distributed measurement of mode coupling in birefringent fibers with random polarization modes A scanning white light interferometer is developed to measure the distributed polarization coupling (DPC) in high birefringence polarization maintaining fibers (PMFs). Traditionally, this technique requests only one polarization mode to be excited or both polarization modes to be excited with equal intensity in the PMF. Thus, an accurate alignment of the polarization direction with the principal axis in PMF is strictly required, which is not facilely realized in practical measurement. This paper develops a method to measure the spatial distribution of polarization mode coupling with random modes excited using a white light Michelson interferometer. The influence of incident polarization extinction ratio (PER) on polarization coupling detection is evaluated theoretically and experimentally. It is also analyzed and validated in corresponding measurement that the sensitivity of the polarization coupling detection system can be improved more than 100 times with the rotation of the analyzer.",1

For this purpose, we investigate all possible configurations of ideal shielding of the overlap between the electromagnetic fields generated by a charge and by a magnetic flux, and analyze their consequences on the Aharonov-Bohm-Casher interference. In a classical treatment of shielding, the Aharonov-Bohm-Casher effect vanishes regardless of the geometry of shielding, when the local overlap of electromagnetic fields is completely eliminated. On the other hand, the result depends on the configuration of shielding if the charge quantization in the superconducting shield is taken into account. It is shown that our results are fully understood in terms of the fluctuating local-field interaction. Our analysis strongly supports the alternative view on the Aharonov-Bohm-Casher interference that the effects originate from the local action of electromagnetic fields.",1
80210,0,"An Integrated Circuit for Radio Astronomy Correlators Supporting Large Arrays of Antennas Radio telescopes that employ arrays of many antennas are in operation, and ever larger ones are being designed and proposed. Signals from the antennas are combined by cross-correlation. For $N$ antennas, the cost and power consumption of cross-correlation are proportional to $N^2$ and dominate at sufficiently large $N$. Here we report the design of an integrated circuit (IC) that performs digital cross-correlations for arbitrarily many antennas in a power-efficient way. It uses an intrinsically low-power architecture in which the movement of data between devices is minimized. In our design, the correlations are performed in an array of 4096 complex multiply-accumulate (CMAC) units. This is sufficient to perform all correlations in parallel for 64 signals ($N$=32 antennas with 2 opposite-polarization signals per antenna). When $N$ is larger, the input data are buffered in an on-chip memory and the CMACs are re-used as many times as needed to compute all correlations. The design has been synthesized and simulated so as to obtain accurate estimates of the IC's size and power consumption. It is intended for fabrication in a 32 nm silicon-on-insulator process, where it will require less than 12 mm$^2$ of silicon area and achieve an energy efficiency of 1.76 to 3.3 pJ per CMAC operation, depending on the number of antennas.

While, rank-based methods would provide good solutions for such case. After investigating several algorithms, a method combining bipartite ranking model with bootstrap aggregating techniques was developed in this paper. The method was applied in searching for carbon stars in the spectral data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR10, and compared with several other popular methods used in data mining.

Model predictions are compared to the average observational estimates of the flux, exploiting a flux estimation method proposed by Winters &amp; D'Asaro (1996). This estimation method enables the disentanglement of the dependence of the average flux on the height above the bottom and on the background temperature gradient. The classical N-shaped flux-gradient relation is found in the observations. Model and observations show similar qualitative behaviour, despite the strong simplifications used in the model. The results shed light on the modulation of the temperature flux by the presence of the boundary, and support the idea of a turbulent flux following a mixing-length argument in a stratified flow. Furthermore, the results support the use of Thorpe scales close to a boundary, if sufficient averaging is performed, suggesting that the Thorpe scales are affected by the boundary in a similar way as the mixing length.",1

80384,0,"Thermodynamics of ultracold trapped gases. Generalized mechanical variables, equation of state and heat capacity The thermodynamics framework of an interacting quantum gas trapped by an arbitrary external potential is reviewed. We show that for each confining potential, in the thermodynamic limit, there emerge ""generalized"" volume and pressure variables ${\cal V}$ and ${\cal P}$, that replace the usual volume and hydrostatic pressure of a uniform system. This scheme is validated with the derivation of the virial expansion of the grand potential. We show that this approach yields experimentally amenable procedures to find the equation of state of the fluid, ${\cal P} = {\cal P}({\cal V}/N,T)$ with $N$ the number of atoms, as well as its heat capacity at constant generalized volume $C_{\cal V} = C_{\cal V}({\cal V},N,T)$. With these two functions, all the thermodynamics properties of the system may be found. As specific examples we study weakly interacting Bose gases trapped by harmonic and by linear quadrupolar potentials within the Hartree-Fock approximation. Comparisons with experimental results of a $^{23}$Na ultracold gas are also presented. We claim that this route should provide an additional and useful tool to analyze both the thermodynamic variables of a trapped gas as well as its elementary excitations.",1

Scientific research from these telescopes is focused on stars, galaxies, and exoplanets using multicolor photometry and spectroscopic observations. Therefore, it is important to provide the observing conditions of the site, in detail, to the astronomers for an efficient use of these facilities.

Our analysis of the observing conditions at Xinglong Observatory can be used as a reference to the observers on targets selection, observing strategy, and telescope operation.",1
80628,0,"The role of stellar relaxation in the formation and evolution of the first massive black holes We present calculations on the formation of massive black holes with 10^5 Msun at z &gt; 6 that can be the seeds of supermassive black holes at z &gt; 6. Under the assumption of compact star cluster formation in merging galaxies, star clusters in haloes of 10^8 ~ 10^9 Msun can undergo rapid core-collapse leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) with ~1000 Msun which directly collapse into black holes with similar masses. Star clusters in halos of &gt; 10^9 Msun experience type-II supernovae before the formation of VMSs due to long core-collapse time scales. We also model the subsequent growth of black holes via accretion of residual stars in clusters. 2-body relaxation efficiently re-fills the loss cones of stellar orbits at larger radii and resonant relaxation at small radii is the main driver for accretion of stars onto black holes. As a result, more than ninety percent of stars in the initial cluster are swallowed by the central black holes before z=6. Using dark matter merger trees we derive black hole mass functions at z=6-20. The mass function ranges from 10^3 to 10^5 Msun at z ~ 4*10^8 Msun at z ~ 20 successfully leads to the formation of &gt;~ 10^5 Msun BHs by z &gt;~ 10 which can be the potential seeds of supermassive black holes seen today.",1

Intense laser pulse offers the acceleration field of 1012 Volt per meter, several orders of magnitude larger than that in conventional accelerators, enabling compact devices. Here we report that a highly-collimated argon ion beam with narrow energy spread is produced by irradiating a 45-fs fully-relativistic laser pulse onto an argon cluster target. The highly-charged (Argon ion with charge state of 16+) heavy ion beam has a minimum absolute energy spread of 0.19 MeV per nucleon at the energy peak of 0.39 MeV per nucleon. we identify a novel scheme from particle-in-cell simulations that greatly reduces the beam energy spread. The laser-driven intense plasma wakefield has a strong modulation on the ion beam in a way that the low energy part is cut off. The pre-accelerated argon ion beam from Coulomb explosion thus becomes more mono-energetic and collimated.",1

80884,0,"Efficient magnetic fields for supporting toroidal plasmas The magnetic field that supports tokamak and stellarator plasmas must be produced by coils well separated from the plasma. However the larger the separation, the more difficult it is to produce a given magnetic field in the plasma region, so plasma configurations should be chosen that can be supported as efficiently as possible by distant coils. The efficiency of an externally-generated magnetic field is a measure of the field's shaping component magnitude at the plasma compared to the magnitude near the coils; the efficiency of a plasma equilibrium can be measured using the efficiency of the required external shaping field. Counterintuitively, plasma shapes with low curvature and spectral width may have low efficiency, whereas plasma shapes with sharp edges may have high efficiency. Two precise measures of magnetic field efficiency, which correctly identify such differences in difficulty, will be examined. These measures, which can be expressed as matrices, relate the externally-produced normal magnetic field on the plasma surface to the either the normal field or current on a distant control surface. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of either matrix yields an efficiency ordered basis for the magnetic field distributions. Calculations are carried out for both tokamak and stellarator cases. For axisymmetric surfaces with circular cross-section, the SVD is calculated analytically, and the range of poloidal and toroidal mode numbers that can be controlled to a given desired level is determined. If formulated properly, these efficiency measures are independent of the coordinates used to parameterize the surfaces.",1
80967,0,"Hourglass Fermions Spatial symmetries in crystals are distinguished by whether they preserve the spatial origin. We show how this basic geometric property gives rise to a new topology in band insulators. We study spatial symmetries that translate the origin by a fraction of the lattice period, and find that these nonsymmorphic symmetries protect a novel surface fermion whose dispersion is shaped like an hourglass; surface bands connect one hourglass to the next in an unbreakable zigzag pattern. These exotic fermions are materialized in the large-gap insulators: KHgX (X=As,Sb,Bi), which we propose as the first material class whose topology relies on nonsymmorphic symmetries. Beside the hourglass fermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a 3D generalization of the quantum spin Hall effect, which has only been observed in 2D crystals. To describe the bulk topology of nonsymmorphic crystals, we propose a non-Abelian generalization of the geometric theory of polarization. Our nontrivial topology originates from an inversion of the rotational quantum numbers, which we propose as a fruitful criterion in the search for topological materials.",1

81338,0,"Quantization of Time in Dynamic Barrier Tunnelling In the B\""uttiker-Landauer perturbation approach to electron tunnelling, through a time-modulated rectilinear potential barrier, the Tien-Gordon identity was invoked, together with its infinite energy spectrum. Here, an exact treatment is presented which is based on the temporal wave-function matching procedure, that led to a finite energy spectrum. In seeking the condition governing the time evolution of the tunnelling process, the Euler formula provided the crucial ingredient for time quantization, which discretised the continuous time in the oscillating barrier potential and energy harmonic equations. As a result, a finite system of inelastic scattering channels was created. When an electron entered the elastic channel, it was scattered, instantaneously, into finite neighbouring energy-level scattering channels, by absorption (emission) of photon energy from (to) the oscillating field, during the transit period across the dynamic barrier. The absorption and emission times of barrier traversal, T_+ and T_-, respectively, were derived for the low and high frequency regimes of the barrier oscillations. Calculations revealed that in the low (high) frequency situation T_+= T_- (T_+&lt; T_-).",1

The spinorial genesis of notion of the orthogonality as aspect of irreducible SSFT is pointed out in the present paper. The main outcome of resorting to an orthogonal RC frame (ORC) is explication of the conformal dynamic invariance of metric i.e. constancy of ratio between components of GM in ORC frame.

81517,0,"Niels Bohr on the wave function and the classical/quantum divide It is well known that Niels Bohr insisted on the necessity of classical concepts in the account of quantum phenomena. But there is little consensus concerning his reasons, and what he exactly meant by this. In this paper, I re-examine Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics, and argue that the necessity of the classical can be seen as part of his response to the measurement problem. More generally, I attempt to clarify Bohr's view on the classical/quantum divide, arguing that the relation between the two theories is that of mutual dependence. An important element in this clarification consists in distinguishing Bohr's idea of the wave function as symbolic from both a purely epistemic and an ontological interpretation. Together with new evidence concerning Bohr's conception of the wave function collapse, this sets his interpretation apart from both standard versions of the Copenhagen interpretation, and from some of the reconstructions of his view found in the literature. I conclude with a few remarks on how Bohr's ideas make much sense also when modern developments in quantum gravity and early universe cosmology are taken into account.",1
81570,0,"Physical vacuum is a special superfluid medium The Navier-Stokes equation contains two terms which have been subjected to slight modification: (a) the viscosity term depends of time (the viscosity in average on time is zero, but its variance is non-zero), (b) the pressure gradient contains an added term describing the quantum entropy gradient multiplied by the pressure. Owing to these modifications, the Navier-Stokes equation can be reduced to the Schr\""odinger equation describing behavior of a particle into the vacuum being as a superfluid medium. Vortex structures arising in this medium show infinitely long life owing to zeroth average viscosity.

81674,0,"An automatic method for segmentation of fission tracks in epidote crystal photomicrographs Manual identification of fission tracks has practical problems, such as variation due to observer-observation efficiency. An automatic processing method that could identify fission tracks in a photomicrograph could solve this problem and improve the speed of track counting.

82018,0,"Generation of anomalously energetic suprathermal electrons by an electron beam interacting with a nonuniform plasma Generation of anomalously energetic suprathermal electrons was observed in simulation of a high- voltage dc discharge with electron emission from the cathode. An electron beam produced by the emission interacts with the nonuniform plasma in the discharge via a two-stream instability. Efficient energy transfer from the beam to the plasma electrons is ensured by the plasma nonuniformity. The electron beam excites plasma waves whose wavelength and phase speed gradually decrease towards anode. The short waves near the anode accelerate plasma bulk electrons to suprathermal energies. The sheath near the anode reflects some of the accelerated electrons back into the plasma. These electrons travel through the plasma, reflect near the cathode, and enter the accelerating area again but with a higher energy than before. Such particles are accelerated to energies much higher than after the first acceleration. This mechanism plays a role in explaining earlier experimental observations of energetic suprathermal electrons in similar discharges.",1

82115,0,"Theory of the Electron Sheath and Presheath Electron sheaths are commonly found near Langmuir probes collecting the electron saturation current. The common assumption is that the probe collects the random flux of electrons incident on the sheath, which tacitly implies that there is no electron presheath and that the flux collected is due to a velocity space truncation of the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF). This work provides a dedicated theory of electron sheaths, which suggests that they are not so simple. Motivated by EVDFs observed in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, a 1D model for the electron sheath and presheath is developed. In the model, under low temperature plasma conditions ($T_e\gg T_i$), an electron pressure gradient accelerates electrons in the presheath to a flow velocity that exceeds the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This pressure gradient generates large flow velocities compared to what would be generated by ballistic motion in response to the electric field. It is found that in many situations, under common plasma conditions, the electron presheath extends much further into the plasma than an analogous ion presheath. PIC simulations reveal that the ion density in the electron presheath is determined by a flow around the electron sheath and that this flow is due to 2D aspects of the sheath geometry. Simulations also indicate the presence of ion acoustic waves excited by the differential flow between electrons and ions in the presheath which result in sheath edge fluctuations. The 1D model and time averaged PIC simulations are compared and it is shown that the model provides a good description of the electron sheath and presheath.",1
82202,0,"Tunable Splitting of the Ground-State Degeneracy in 1D Parafermionic Wires Systems with topologically protected ground-state degeneracies are currently of great interest due to their potential applications in quantum computing. In practise this degeneracy is never exact, and the magnitude of the ground-state degeneracy splitting imposes constraints on the timescales over which information is topologically protected. In this Letter we use an instanton approach to evaluate the splitting of topological ground-state degeneracy in quasi-1D systems with parafermion zero modes, in the specific case where parafermions are realized by inducing a superconducting gap in pairs of fractional quantum Hall edges. We show that, like 1D topological superconducting wires, this splitting has an oscillatory dependence on the chemical potential, which arises from an intrinsic Berry phase that produces interference between distinct instanton tunneling events. These Berry phases can be mapped to chiral phases in a (dual) quantum clock model using a Fradkin-Kadanoff transformation. Comparing our low-energy spectrum to that of phenomenological parafermion models allows us to evaluate the real and imaginary parts of the hopping integral between adjacent parafermionic zero modes as a function of the chemical potential.",1

These differences can be organized along the 4D Eigenvector 1 sequence: at least at low z, with only Population A sources radiating at relatively high Eddington ratio and showing prominent high-velocity outflows in Civ {\lambda}1549 line profiles. We discuss in this paper VLT-FORS observations of Civ {\lambda}1549 emission line profiles for a high-luminosity sample of Hamburg- ESO quasars and how they are affected by outflow motion as a function of quasar luminosity. Our high- luminosity sample has the notable advantage that the rest frame has been accurately determined from previous VLT-ISAAC observations of H{\beta} in the J, H, and K bands. This makes measures of inter-line velocity shifts accurate and free of systemic biases. As the redshift increases and the luminosity of the brightest quasars increases, powerful, high-velocity outflows become more frequent.

82442,0,"Hubble-Lema\^itre fragmentation and the path to equilibrium of merger-driven cluster formation This paper discusses a new method to generate self-coherent initial conditions for young substructured stellar cluster. The expansion of a uniform system allows stellar sub-structures (clumps) to grow from fragmentation modes by adiabatic cooling. We treat the system mass elements as stars, chosen according to a Salpeter mass function, and the time-evolution is performed with a collisional N-body integrator. This procedure allows to create a fully-coherent relation between the clumps' spatial distribution and the underlying velocity field. The cooling is driven by the gravitational field, as in a cosmological Hubble-Lema\^itre flow. The fragmented configuration has a `fractal'-like geometry but with a self-grown velocity field and mass profile. We compare the characteristics of the stellar population in clumps with that obtained from hydrodynamical simulations and find a remarkable correspondence between the two in terms of the stellar content and the degree of spatial mass-segregation. In the fragmented configuration, the IMF power index is ~0.3 lower in clumps in comparison to the field stellar population, in agreement with observations in the Milky Way. We follow in time the dynamical evolution of fully fragmented and sub-virial configurations, and find a soft collapse, leading rapidly to equilibrium (timescale of 1 Myr for a ~ 10^4 Msun system). The low-concentration equilibrium implies that the dynamical evolution including massive stars is less likely to induce direct collisions and the formation of exotic objects. Low-mass stars already ejected from merging clumps are depleted in the end-result stellar clusters, which harbour a top-heavy stellar mass function.",1

In particular, a nontrivial {\pi}-Berry phase in the SdH gives clear evidence for 3D Dirac semimetal phase. Furthermore, we observed clear Landau Level splitting under high magnetic field, suggesting possible splitting of Dirac point into Weyl points due to broken time reversal symmetry. Our results indicate that ZrTe5 is an ideal platform to study 3D massless Dirac and Weyl fermions in a layered compound.",1

We show the thermal Hall conductivity is well described by the temperature linear term and the exponential term in the low temperature region. While the former term is proportional to the so-called Chern number directly, the latter is associated with the superconducting gap amplitude of the gamma band. We also demonstrate that the coefficient of the exponential term changes the sign around Lifshitz transition. Our obtained result may enable us access easily the physical quantities and the topological property of Sr2RuO4 in detail.",1
82796,0,"Powerful quasar outflow in a massive disc galaxy at $z \sim 5$ There is growing observational evidence of high-redshift quasars launching energetic, fast outflows, but the effects that these have on their host galaxies is poorly understood. We employ the moving-mesh code AREPO to study the feedback from a quasar that has grown to $\sim 10^9 M_\odot$ by $z \sim 5$ and the impact that this has on its host galaxy. Our simulations use a super-Lagrangian refinement technique to increase the accuracy with which the interface of the quasar-driven wind and the surrounding gas is resolved. We find that the feedback injected in these simulations is less efficient at removing gas from the galaxy than in an identical simulation with no super-Lagrangian refinement. This leads to the growth of a massive, rotationally supported, star-forming disc, co-existing with a powerful quasar-driven outflow. The properties of our host galaxy, including the kinematical structure of the gaseous disc and of the outflow, are in good agreement with current observations. Upcoming ALMA and JWST observations will be an excellent test of our model and will provide further clues as to the variance in properties of high-redshift quasar hosts.",1
82813,0,"Sodium Absorption Systems toward SN Ia 2014J Originate on Interstellar Scales Na I D absorbing systems toward Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been intensively studied over the last decade with the aim of finding circumstellar material (CSM), which is an indirect probe of the progenitor system. However, it is difficult to deconvolve CSM components from non-variable, and often dominant, components created by interstellar material (ISM). We present a series of high-resolution spectra of SN Ia 2014J from before maximum brightness to ~250 days after maximum brightness. The late-time spectrum provides unique information for determining the origin of the Na I D absorption systems. The deep late-time observation allows us to probe the environment around the SN at a large scale, extending to ~40 pc. We find that a spectrum of diffuse light in the vicinity, but not directly in the line-of-sight, of the SN has absorbing systems nearly identical to those obtained for the ""pure"" SN line-of-sight. Therefore, basically all Na I D systems seen toward SN 2014J must originate from foreground material that extends to at least ~40 pc in projection and none at the CSM scale. A fluctuation in the column densities at a scale of ~20 pc is also identified. After subtracting the diffuse, ""background"" spectrum, the late-time SN Na I D profile along the SN line-of-sight is consistent with the profile in the near-maximum brightness spectra. The lack of variability on a ~1 year timescale is consistent with the ISM interpretation for the gas.",1

Current IR spectroscopy techniques require the use of optical equipment suited for operation in the IR range, which faces challenges of inferior performance and high cost. Here we develop a spectroscopy technique, which allows spectral measurements in the IR range using visible spectral range components. The technique is based on nonlinear interference of infrared and visible photons, produced via Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC). The intensity interference pattern for a visible photon depends on the phase of an IR photon, which travels through the media. This allows determining properties of the media in the IR range from the measurements of visible photons. The technique can substitute and/or complement conventional IR spectroscopy techniques, as it uses well-developed optical components for the visible range.",1

Such hybrid transitions do not fit into the modest classification of thermodynamic transitions and as such, they used to be overlooked or incorrectly identified in the past. The recent series of observations of such transitions in many diverse systems suggest that a new taxonomy of phase transitions is needed. The spin model we present due to its simplicity and possible experimental designs could bring us to this goal. We find the Hamiltonian of the model from which partition function is easily calculated.

This active BH was originally selected due to its rapid optical variability, from a few hours to a day, based on Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam~(HSC) g-band imaging data taken with 1-hour cadence. Broad and narrow H-alpha and many other emission lines are detected in our optical spectra taken with Subaru FOCAS, and the BH mass is measured via the broad H-alpha emission line width (1,880 km s^{-1}) and luminosity (4.2x10^{40} erg s^{-1}) after careful correction for the atmospheric absorption around 7,580-7,720A. We measure the Eddington ratio to be as low as 0.05, considerably smaller than those in a previous SDSS sample with similar BH mass and redshift, which indicates one of the strong potentials of our Subaru survey. The g-r color and morphology of the extended component indicate that the host galaxy is a star-forming galaxy. We also show effectiveness of our variability selection for low-mass active BHs.",1

Particular attention is given to the sharing of available energy between the post-ionization constituents. A simple model for the energy-partition function that qualitatively captures the physics of high-energy and near-threshold ionization is developed for PII, with free parameters that can be used to fit the model to experimental data. By applying the model to the measurements of Kover and Laricchia [1] for positrons in H2, the role of energy-partitioning in PII for positron thermalisation is studied. Although the overall thermalisation time is found to be relatively insensitive to the energy-partitioning, the mean energy profiles at certain times can differ by more than an order of magnitude for the various treatments of energy-partitioning. This can significantly impact the number and energy distribution of secondary electrons.",1
83108,0,"Particle relabeling symmetry, generalized vorticity, and normal-mode expansion of ideal, incompressible fluids and plasmas in three-dimensional space Lagrangian mechanical consideration of the dynamics of ideal, incompressible hydrodynamic, magnetohydrodynamic, and Hall magnetohydrodynamic media, which are formulated as dynamical systems on some appropriate Lie groups equipped with Riemannian metrics, leads to the notion of generalized vorticities, as well as generalized coordinates, velocities, and momenta. The action of each system is conserved against the integral path variation in the direction of the generalized vorticity, and this invariance is associated with the particle relabeling symmetry. The generalized vorticities are formulated by the operation of integro-differential operators upon the generalized velocities. The eigenfunctions of the operators provide sets of orthogonal functions, and, expanding by them, we obtain a common formula for these dynamical systems. In particular, we find that the product of the Riemannian metric, $M_{im}$, and the structure constants of the Lie group, $C^{m}_{jk}$, is given by the product of the eigenvalue of the operator, $\Lambda(i)$, and a certain totally antisymmetric tensor, $T_{ijk}$: $M_{i\alpha}C^{\alpha}_{jk}=\Lambda(i)T_{ijk}.$",1

Such states are characterized by non-trivial Chern numbers, and exhibit protected edge modes which give rise to chiral elastic and inelastic photon transport. These topological bosonic states are not equivalent to their fermionic (topological superconductor) counterparts and cannot be mapped by a local transformation onto topological states found in particle-conserving models. They thus represent a new type of topological system. We study this physics in detail in the case of a Kagome lattice model, and discuss possible realizations using nonlinear photonic crystals or superconducting circuits.",1

83288,0,"Topologically driven nonequilibrium phase transitions in diagonal ensembles We identify a new class of topologically driven phase transitions when calculating the Hall conductance of two-band Chern insulators in the long-time limit after a global quench of the Hamiltonian. The Hall conductance is expressed as the integral of the Berry curvature in the diagonal ensemble. Even if the topological invariant of the wave function is conserved under unitary evolution, the Hall conductance as a function of the energy gap in the post-quench Hamiltonian displays a continuous but nonanalytic behavior, that is it has a logarithmically divergent derivative as the gap closes. The coefficient of this logarithmic function is the ratio of the change of Chern number in the ground state of the post-quench Hamiltonian to the energy gap in the initial state. This nonanalytic behavior is universal in two-band Chern insulators.",1
83354,0,"Magnetized galactic halos and velocity lags We present an analytic model of a magnetized galactic halo surrounding a Mestel gravitating disc. The magnetic field is taken to be in energy equipartition with the pressure dominant rotating halo gas ({\it not} with the cosmic rays), and the whole system is in a steady state. A more flexible `anisotropic equipartition' model is also explored. A definite pressure law is required to maintain the equilibrium, but the halo density is constant. The velocity/magnetic system is scale-free. The objective is to find the rotational velocity lag in such a halo. The magnetic field is not force-free so that angular momentum may be transported from the halo to the intergalactic medium. We find that the `X'-shaped structure observed for halo magnetic fields can be obtained together with a simple analytic formula for the rate of decline of the velocity with height $z$. The formula also predicts the change in lag with radius, $r$.",1

83417,0,"Diffuse coronae in cosmological simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies We investigate the properties of halo gas using three cosmological `zoom-in' simulations of realistic Milky Way-galaxy analogs with varying sub-grid physics. In all three cases, the mass of hot ($T &gt; 10^6$ K) halo gas is $\sim 1\%$ of the host's virial mass. The X-ray luminosity of two of the runs is consistent with observations of the Milky Way, while the third simulation is X-ray bright and resembles more closely a very massive, star-forming spiral. Hot halos extend to 140 kpc from the galactic center and are surrounded by a bubble of warm-hot ($T = 10^5 - 10^6$K) gas that extends to the virial radius. Simulated halos agree well outside 20-30 kpc with the $\beta$-model of Miller &amp; Bregman (2013) based on OVII absorption and OVIII emission measurements. Warm--hot and hot gas contribute up to $80\%$ of the total gas reservoir, and contain nearly the same amount of baryons as the stellar component. The mass of warm-hot and hot components falls into the range estimated for $L^*$ galaxies. With key observational constraints on the density of the Milky Way corona being satisfied, we show that concealing of the ubiquitous warm-hot baryons, along with the ejection of just $20-30 \%$ of the diffuse gas out of the potential wells by supernova-driven outflows, can solve the ""missing baryon problem"". The recovered baryon fraction within 3 virial radii is $90\%$ of the universal value.

It is based on a doubly-clamped silicon nitride nanobeam resonator covered with a thin magnetostrictive film. Changing the magnetization direction within the film plane by an applied magnetic field generates a magnetostrictive stress and thus changes the resonance frequency of the nanobeam. A measurement of the resulting resonance frequency shift, e.g. by optical interferometry, allows to quantitatively determine the magnetostriction constants of the thin film. We use this method to determine the magnetostriction constants of a 10nm thick polycrystalline cobalt film, showing very good agreement with literature values.

Using a Ramsey experiment performed shortly after the measurement pulse to quantify the residual population, we find that compared to a square pulse followed by a delay, this pulse shape reduces the timescale for cavity ring-down by more than twice the cavity time constant. At low drive powers, this performance is achieved using pulse parameters calculated from a linear cavity model; at higher powers, empirical optimization of the pulse parameters leads to similar performance.",1

The noncentrosymmetric structure and strong spin-orbit coupling give rise to spinful nodal-line bulk states which are protected by a mirror reflection symmetry of this compound. This is remarkably distinguished from other proposed nodal-line semimetals such as Cu3NPb(Zn) in which nodal lines exist only in the limit of vanishing spin-orbit coupling.

In this range, the absorption efficiency of both the dipole and meander line changed little, however the conductivity significantly impacts on radiation efficiency and the absorption cross section of the antennas. The extinction cross section of the dipole and meander line antennas (antennas that Thevenin equivalent circuit is applicable) also vary with radiation efficiency. From the point of radiation efficiency, the dipole antenna performance is most robust under decreasing conductivity. Antennas studied in this study were fabricated with brass and graphite.

Our aim is to identify new line-ratio diagnostics to discriminate between gas photoionization by active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation. We use a standard photoionization code to compute the emission from AGN narrow-line regions and compare this with calculations of the nebular emission from star-forming galaxies achieved using the same code. We confirm the appropriateness of widely used optical spectral diagnostics of nuclear activity versus star formation and explore new diagnostics at ultraviolet wavelengths. We find that combinations of a collisionally excited metal line or line multiplet, such as CIV 1548,1551, OIII]1661,1666, NIII]1750, [SiIII]1883+[SiIII]1892 and [CIII]1907+CIII]1909, with the HeII 1640 recombination line are individually good discriminants of the nature of the ionizing source.

84452,0,"The Contribution of Host Galaxies to the Infrared Energy Output of $z\gtrsim5.0$ QUASARS The infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of $z\gtrsim 5$ quasars can be reproduced by combining a low-metallicity galaxy template with a standard AGN template. The host galaxy is represented by Haro 11, a compact, moderately low metallicity, star-bursting galaxy that shares typical features of high-$z$ galaxies. For the vast majority of $z\gtrsim 5$ quasars, the AGN contribution is well modeled by a standard empirical template with the contamination of star formation in the infrared subtracted. Together, these two templates can separate the contributions from the host galaxy and the AGN even in the case of limited data points, given that this model has only two free parameters. Using this method, we re-analyze 69 $z\gtrsim 5$ quasars with extensive Herschel observations, and derive their AGN luminosities $L_{\rm AGN}$ in a range $\sim (0.78-27.4) \times10^{13}\, L_{\odot}$, the infrared luminosities from star formation $L_{\rm SF,IR} \sim (&lt;1.5-25.7)\times10^{12}\, L_{\odot}$, and the corresponding star formation rates ${\rm SFR}\sim (&lt;290-2650)\, M_\odot/{\rm yr}$. The average infrared luminosity from star formation and the average total AGN luminosity of the $z\gtrsim5$ quasar sample follows the correlation defined by quasars at $z &lt; 2.6$. We assume these quasar host galaxies maintain a constant average SFR ($\sim620\, M_\odot/{\rm yr}$) during their mass assembly and estimate the stellar mass that could form till $z\sim5-6$ to be $\langle M_* \rangle \sim(3-5)\times10^{11} M_\odot$.

Based on the instantaneous Stokes-Mueller formalism to describe the high-frequency evolution of the DFDP beam intensity, we thoroughly analyze the interaction of such a beam with birefringent, dichroic and depolarizing samples. This allows us to confirm that orthogonality breaking is produced by the sample diattenuation, whereas this technique is immune to both birefringence and diagonal depolarization. We further analyze the robustness of this technique when polarimetric sensing is performed through a birefringent waveguide, and the optimal DFDP source configuration for fiber-based endoscopic measurements is subsequently identified. Finally, we consider a stochastic depolarization model based on an ensemble of random linear diattenuators, which makes it possible to understand the progressive vanishing of the detected orthogonality breaking signal as the spatial heterogeneity of the sample increases, thus confirming the insensitivity of this method to diagonal depolarization. The fact that the orthogonality breaking signal is exclusively due to the sample dichroism is an advantageous feature for the precise decoupled characterization of such an anisotropic parameter in samples showing several simultaneous effects.",1

However, limitations imposed by the previous generation of radio interferometers at metre wavelengths has meant that this region of parameter space remains largely unexplored. In this paper, the first in a series examining FR IIs at low frequencies, we use LOFAR observations between 50 and 160 MHz, along with complementary archival radio and X-ray data, to explore the properties of two FR II sources, 3C452 and 3C223. We find that the morphology of 3C452 is that of a standard FR II rather than of a double-double radio galaxy as had previously been suggested, with no remnant emission being observed beyond the active lobes. We find that the low-frequency integrated spectra of both sources are much steeper than expected based on traditional assumptions and, using synchrotron/inverse-Compton model fitting, show that the total energy content of the lobes is greater than previous estimates by a factor of around 5 for 3C452 and 2 for 3C223. We go on to discuss possible causes of these steeper than expected spectra and provide revised estimates of the internal pressures and magnetic field strengths for the intrinsically steep case. We find that the ratio between the equipartition magnetic field strengths and those derived through synchrotron/inverse-Compton model fitting remains consistent with previous findings and show that the observed departure from equipartition may in some cases provide a solution to the spectral versus dynamical age disparity.",1

We report the discovery of an intervening z = 3.335 +- 0.007 DLA along a galaxy sight-line identified among 80 Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) spectra obtained with our Very Large Telescope/Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph survey in the SSA22 field. The measured DLA neutral hydrogen (HI) column density is log (NHI/cm^{-2}) = 21.68 +- 0.17. The DLA covering fraction over the extended background LBG is &gt; 70% (2 sigma), yielding a conservative constraint on the DLA area of &gt; 1 kpc^2. Our search for a counterpart galaxy hosting this DLA concludes that there is no counterpart galaxy with star formation rate (SFR) larger than a few Msun yr^{-1}, ruling out an unobscured violent star formation in the DLA gas cloud. We also rule out the possibility that the host galaxy of the DLA is a passive galaxy with Mstar &gt; 5 x 10^{10} Msun or a heavily dust-obscured galaxy with E(B-V) &gt; 2. The DLA may coincide with a large-scale overdensity of the spectroscopic LBGs. The occurrence rate of the DLA is compatible with that of DLAs found in QSO sight-lines.",1

The same type of Majorana zero mode can also be realized at crystalline dislocations in 2D superconductors with the nontrivial weak topological indices. Unlike at an Abrikosov vortex, at such a dislocation, there are no other low-lying midgap states than the Majorana zero mode so that it avoids usual complications encountered in experimental detections such as scanning tunneling microscope (STM) measurements. We will show that, using the anisotropic dispersion of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals of Ti or Ta atoms, such a weak topological superconductivity can be realized when the surface 2DEG of SrTiO$_3$ or KTaO$_3$ becomes superconducting, which can occur through either intrinsic pairing or proximity to existing s-wave superconductors.",1

85267,0,"Probing Critical Surfaces in Momentum Space Using Real-Space Entanglement Entropy: Bose versus Fermi A co-dimension one critical surface in the momentum space can be either a familiar Fermi surface, which separates occupied states from empty ones in the non-interacting fermion case, or a novel Bose surface, where gapless bosonic excitations are anchored. Their presence gives rise to logarithmic violation of entanglement entropy area law. When they are convex, we show that the shape of these critical surfaces can be determined by inspecting the leading logarithmic term of real space entanglement entropy. The fundamental difference between a Fermi surface and a Bose surface is revealed by the fact that the logarithmic terms in entanglement entropies differ by a factor of two: $S^{Bose}_{log} = 2 S^{Fermi}_{log}$, even when they have identical geometry. Our method has remarkable similarity with determining Fermi surface shape using quantum oscillation. We also discuss possible probes of concave critical surfaces in momentum space.",1

85655,0,"Multiphase turbulent interstellar medium: some recent results from radio astronomy The radio frequency 1.4 GHz transition of the atomic hydrogen is one of the important tracers of the diffuse neutral interstellar medium. Radio astronomical observations of this transition, using either a single dish telescope or an array interferometer, reveal different properties of the interstellar medium. Such observations are particularly useful to study the multiphase nature and turbulence in the interstellar gas. Observations with multiple radio telescopes have recently been used to study these two closely related aspects in greater detail. Using various observational techniques, the density and the velocity fluctuations in the Galactic interstellar medium was found to have a Kolmogorov-like power law power spectra. The observed power law scaling of the turbulent velocity dispersion with the length scale can be used to derive the true temperature distribution of the medium. Observations from a large ongoing atomic hydrogen absorption line survey have also been used to study the distribution of gas at different temperature. The thermal steady state model predicts that the multiphase neutral gas will exist in cold and warm phase with temperature below 200 K and above 5000 K respectively. However, these observations clearly show the presence of a large fraction of gas in the intermediate unstable phase. These results raise serious doubt about the validity of the standard model, and highlight the necessity of alternative theoretical models. Interestingly, numerical simulations suggest that some of the observational results can be explained consistently by including the effects of turbulence in the models of the multiphase medium. This review article presents a brief outline of some of the basic ideas of radio astronomical observations and data analysis, summarizes the results from recent observations, and discusses possible implications of the results.",1

These data strongly favour the grazing sheet model over turbulence as the primary source of pulsar scattering. This model can reproduce the parameters of the observed diffractive scintillation with an accuracy at the percent level. Comparison with new VLBI proper motion results in a direct measure of the ionized ISM screen transverse velocity. The results are consistent with ISM velocities local to the PSR 0834+06 sight-line (through the Galaxy). The simple 1D structure of the lenses opens up the possibility of using interstellar lenses as precision probes for pulsar lens mapping, precision transverse motions in the ISM, and new opportunities for removing scattering to improve pulsar timing. We describe the parameters and observables of this double screen system. While relative screen distances can in principle be accurately determined, a global conformal distance degeneracy exists that allows a rescaling of the absolute distance scale. For PSR B0834+06, we present VLBI astrometry results that provide (for the fist time) a direct measurement of the distance of the pulsar. For targets where independent distance measurements are not available, which are the cases for most of the recycled millisecond pulsars that are the targets of precision timing observations, the degeneracy presented in the lens modelling could be broken if the pulsar resides in a binary system.",1

The method relies on hydrodynamically confined nanoliter volumes of reagents to interact with the substrate at the micrometer-length scale. We study the interplay between diffusion, advection, and surface chemistry and present the design of a noncontact scanning microfluidic device to efficiently present reagents on surfaces. By leveraging convective flows, recirculation, and mixing of a processing liquid, this device overcomes limitations of existing biopatterning approaches, such as passive diffusion of analytes, uncontrolled wetting, and drying artifacts. We demonstrate the deposition of analytes, showing a 2- to 5-fold increase in deposition rate together with a 10-fold reduction in analyte consumption while ensuring less than 6% variation in pattern homogeneity on a standard biological substrate. In addition, we demonstrate the recirculation of a processing liquid using a microfluidic probe (MFP) in the context of a surface assay for (i) probing 12 independent areas with a single microliter of processing liquid and (ii) processing a 2 mm2 surface to create 170 antibody spots of 50 x 100 {\mu}m2 area using 1.6 {\mu}L of liquid.

We present the general solution of the problem and consider the quantum reflection at transmission of a particle above this potential barrier. Compared with the abrupt-step and hyperbolic tangent potentials, which are reproduced by the Lambert potential in certain parameter and/or variable variation regions, the reflection coefficient is smaller because of the lesser steepness of the potential on the particle incidence side.

There is a growing need for algorithms that identify a variety of different features in a simulation without requiring a ""by-eye"" search. We present tensor classification as such a technique for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). These methods have already been used to great effect in N-Body cosmological simulations, which require smoothing defined as an input free parameter. We show that tensor classification successfully identifies a wide range of structures in SPH density fields using its native smoothing, removing a free parameter from the analysis and preventing the need for tesselation of the density field, as required by some classification algorithms. As examples, we show that tensor classification using the tidal tensor and the velocity shear tensor successfully identifies filaments, shells and sheet structures in giant molecular cloud simulations, as well as spiral arms in discs. The relationship between structures identified using different tensors illustrates how different forces compete and co-operate to produce the observed density field. We therefore advocate the use of multiple tensors to classify structure in SPH simulations, to shed light on the interplay of multiple physical processes.",1

87171,0,"Notes on Gauss law applied for time varying electric field in vacuum Gauss's law in integral form states that closed surface integral of electric field is proportional to net charge present within the volume bounded by this closed surface. Gauss's law in differential form states that divergence of electric field is proportional to charge's volume density. From Gauss's law it is concluded that in vacuum, where no electric charges are present, divergence of electric field and closed surface integral of electric field are zero. In this paper we make an attempt to theoretically prove that for time-varying electric fields Gauss's law is not valid. In other words, for time-varying electric field even in vacuum divergence of electric field and closed surface integral of electric field are non-zero. We do this by considering simple sinusoidal motion of the charge and then by calculating closed surface integral at specific time of time-varying electric field due to charge motion. Results show that for charges at still and at motion with constant velocity Gauss's law is valid. However for charges moving with acceleration, Gauss's law is no longer valid.",1

Under the dual supermassive black hole model for double-peaked narrow emitters, we could expect statistically smaller virial black hole masses estimated by observed broad Balmer line properties than true black hole masses (total masses of central two black holes). Then, we compare the virial black hole masses between a sample of 37 double-peaked narrow emitters with broad Balmer lines and samples of SDSS selected normal broad line AGN with single-peaked \oiii lines. However, we can find clearly statistically larger calculated virial black hole masses for the 37 broad line AGN with double-peaked \oiii lines than for samples of normal broad line AGN. Therefore, we give our conclusion that the dual supermassive black hole model is probably not statistically preferred to the double-peaked narrow emitters, and more efforts should be necessary to carefully find candidates for dual supermassive black holes by observed double-peaked narrow emission lines.",1

We explore possible zero-temperature phases of the model as a function of on-site repulsive interaction strength and next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude and phase. Our approach allows us to access the regime of intermediate interaction strength, where charge fluctuations are significant and effective spin model descriptions may not be justified. Our approach also improves upon mean-field solutions of the Haldane-Hubbard model by retaining local quantum fluctuations and treating them nonperturbatively. We find a correlated topological Chern insulator for weak interactions and a topologically trivial N\'eel antiferromagnetic insulator for strong interactions. For intermediate interactions, we find that topologically nontrivial N\'eel antiferromagnetic insulating phases and/or a topologically nontrivial nonmagnetic insulating phase may be stabilized.",1

88179,0,"Dicke Model for Quantum Hall Systems Quantum Hall (QH) systems consist of many-body electron and nuclear spins. They are coupled so weakly through the hyperfine interaction that normally electron spin dynamics are scarcely affected by the nuclear spins. The dynamics of the QH systems, however, may drastically change when the nuclear spins interact with low-energy collective excitation modes of the electron spins. We theoretically investigate the nuclear-electron spin interaction in the QH systems as hybrid quantum systems driven by the hyperfine interaction. In particular, we study the interaction between the nuclear spins and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode with the linear dispersion relation associated with the U(1) spin rotational symmetry breaking. We show that such an interaction is described as nuclear spins collectively coupled to the NG mode, and can be effectively described by the Dicke model. Based on the model we suggest that various collective spin phenomena realized in quantum optical systems also emerge in the QH systems.",1
88369,0,"Estimation of direct laser acceleration in laser wakefield accelerators using particle-in-cell simulations Many current laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) experiments are carried out in a regime where the laser pulse length is on the order of or longer than the wake wavelength and where ionization injection is employed to inject electrons into the wake. In these experiments, the trapped electrons will co-propagate with the longitudinal wakefield and the transverse laser field. In this scenario, the electrons can gain a significant amount of energy from both the direct laser acceleration (DLA) mechanism as well as the usual LWFA mechanism. Particle-in-cell (PIC) codes are frequently used to discern the relative contribution of these two mechanisms. However, if the longitudinal resolution used in the PIC simulations is inadequate, it can produce numerical heating that can overestimate the transverse motion, which is important in determining the energy gain due to DLA. We have therefore carried out a systematic study of this LWFA regime by varying the longitudinal resolution of PIC simulations from the standard, best-practice resolution of 30 points per laser wavelength to four times that value and then examining the energy gain characteristics of both the highest-energy electrons and the bulk electrons. By calculating the contribution of DLA to the final energies of the electrons produced from the LWFA, we find that although the transverse momentum and oscillation radii are over-estimated in the lower-resolution simulations, this over-estimation does not lead to artificial energy gain by DLA. Rather, the DLA contribution to the highest-energy electrons is larger in the higher-resolution cases because the DLA resonance is better maintained. Thus, even at the highest longitudinal resolutions, DLA contributes a significant portion of the energy gained by the highest-energy electrons and also contributes to accelerating the bulk of the charge in the electron beam produced by the LWFA.",1

Their potentials are calculated for the first time: they are meromorphic (rational) functions with singularities at the boundaries of the configuration space. Ground state eigenfunctions are algebraic functions in a form of polynomials in some degrees.

As the system is driven through the quantum critical point by tuning the Hamiltonian, the vanishing energy gap between the ground state and first excited state causes the reaction time scale of the system to diverge, preventing it from adiabatically following the ground state. We measure the temporal evolution of the spin populations for different quench speeds and determine the exponents characterizing the scaling of the onset of excitations, which are in good agreement with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.",1
88606,0,"Shock structures of astrospheres The interaction between a supersonic stellar wind and a (super-)sonic interstellar wind has recently been viewed with new interest. We here first give an overview of the modeling, which includes the heliosphere as an example of a special astrosphere. Then we concentrate on the shock structures of fluid models, especially of hydrodynamic (HD) models. More involved models taking into account radiation transfer and magnetic fields are briefly sketched. Even the relatively simple HD models show a rich shock structure, which might be observable in some objects. We employ a single fluid model to study these complex shock structures, and compare the results obtained including heating and cooling with results obtained without these effects. Furthermore, we show that in the hypersonic case valuable information of the shock structure can be obtained from the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. We solved the Euler equations for the single fluid case and also for a case including cooling and heating. We also discuss the analytical Rankine-Hugoniot relations and their relevance to observations. We show that the only obtainable length scale is the termination shock distance. Moreover, the so-called thin shell approximation is usually not valid. We present the shock structure in the model that includes heating and cooling, which differs remarkably from that of a single fluid scenario in the region of the shocked interstellar medium. We find that the heating and cooling is mainly important in this region and is negligible in the regions dominated by the stellar wind beyond an inner boundary.",1
88687,0,"GPS/CSS radio sources and their relation to other AGN We are entering a new era of sensitive, large-area and multi-frequency radio surveys that will allow us to identify Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio sources over a wide range in radio luminosity and study them within the context of the overall radio-source populations to which they belong. 'Classical' GPS/CSS objects are extremely luminous radio sources with a compact double morphology, commonly thought to represent the earliest stages in the life cycle of powerful radio galaxies (e.g. O'Dea 1998). It is now becoming easier to identify GPS/CSS candidates with much lower radio luminosity - particularly in the nearby Universe. These less powerful objects, with typical 1.4 GHz radio luminosities of $10^{23}$ to $10^{25}$ W/Hz, include peaked-spectrum radio sources with a core-jet morphology on parsec scales as well as high-frequency GPS-like peaked components embedded within lower-frequency extended emission. In the latter case, the presence of a young GPS component may not be evident from low-frequency data alone. Many radio galaxies in the local Universe have a compact (FR-0) morphology, and appear to lack extended radio emission on kiloparsec scales. The relationship of these FR-0 objects to the classical GPS/CSS radio sources remains unclear - some of them may represent short-lived episodes of AGN activity that will not lead to an extended FR-1 or FR-2 radio galaxy. Future wide-band radio surveys will shed more light on this - such surveys should ideally be coordinated to cover the full frequency range from 100 MHz to 100 GHz in order to sample all stages of GPS/CSS evolution in an unbiased way.",1

BoRG[z9-10] is the continuation of a multi-year pure-parallel near-IR and optical imaging campaign with the Wide Field Camera 3. The ongoing survey uses five filters, optimized for detecting the most distant objects and offering continuous wavelength coverage from {\lambda}=0.35{\mu}m to {\lambda}=1.7{\mu}m. We analyze the initial ~130 arcmin$^2$ of area over 28 independent lines of sight (~25% of the total planned) to search for z&gt;7 galaxies using a combination of Lyman break and photometric redshift selections. From an effective comoving volume of (5-25) $times 10^5$ Mpc$^3$ for magnitudes brighter than $m_{AB}=26.5-24.0$ in the $H_{160}$-band respectively, we find five galaxy candidates at z~8.3-10 detected at high confidence (S/N&gt;8), including a source at z~8.4 with mAB=24.5 (S/N~22), which, if confirmed, would be the brightest galaxy identified at such early times (z&gt;8). In addition, BoRG[z9-10] data yield four galaxies with $7.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 8$.

89047,0,"Supernova Feedback in Molecular Clouds: Global Evolution and Dynamics We use magnetohydrodynamical simulations of converging warm neutral medium flows to analyse the formation and global evolution of magnetised and turbulent molecular clouds subject to supernova feedback from massive stars. We show that supernova feedback alone fails to disrupt entire, gravitationally bound, molecular clouds, but is able to disperse small--sized (~10 pc) regions on timescales of less than 1 Myr. Efficient radiative cooling of the supernova remnant as well as strong compression of the surrounding gas result in non-persistent energy and momentum input from the supernovae. However, if the time between subsequent supernovae is short and they are clustered, large hot bubbles form that disperse larger regions of the parental cloud. On longer timescales, supernova feedback increases the amount of gas with moderate temperatures (T~300-3000 K). Despite its inability to disrupt molecular clouds, supernova feedback leaves a strong imprint on the star formation process. We find an overall reduction of the star formation efficiency by a factor of 2 and of the star formation rate by roughly factors of 2-4.",1
89128,0,"Broad-band spectral energy distribution of 3000 Angstroem break quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) discovered a few unusual quasars with a characteristic break in the continuum around 3000 A that neither shows the typical structure of broad absorption line (BAL) troughs nor is explained by typical intrinsic dust reddening. We used the method of Kohonen self-organising maps for a systematical search for quasars with such properties in the SDSS spectra archive. We constructed a sample of 23 quasars classified as 3000 A break quasars and two comparison samples of quasars with similar properties, to some extent, but also showing typical BAL features. We computed ensemble-averaged broad-band SEDs based on archival data from SDSS, GALEX, 2MASS, UKIDSS, and WISE. The SEDs were corrected for intrinsic dust absorption by the comparison with the average SED of normal quasars. The de-reddened arithmetic median composite SED of the 3000 A break quasars is found to be indistinguishable from that of the unusual BAL quasars. We conclude that 3000 A break quasars are most likely extreme versions of BAL quasars. Assuming that the intrinsic SED of the continuum source is represented by the quasar composite SED, the 3000 A break quasars tend to be intrinsically more luminous than ordinary quasars.

89231,0,"Fast Vascular Ultrasound Imaging with Enhanced Spatial Resolution and Background Rejection Ultrasound super-localization microscopy techniques presented in the last few years enable non-invasive imaging of vascular structures at the capillary level by tracking the flow of ultrasound contrast agents (gas microbubbles). However, these techniques are currently limited by low temporal resolution and long acquisition times. Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a fluorescence microscopy technique enabling sub-diffraction limit imaging with high temporal resolution by calculating high order statistics of the fluctuating optical signal. The aim of this work is to achieve fast acoustic imaging with enhanced resolution by applying the tools used in SOFI to contrast-enhance ultrasound (CEUS) plane-wave scans. The proposed method was tested using numerical simulations and evaluated using two in-vivo rabbit models: scans of healthy kidneys and VX-2 tumor xenografts. Improved spatial resolution was observed with a reduction of up to 50% in the full width half max of the point spread function. In addition, substantial reduction in the background level was achieved compared to standard mean amplitude persistence images, revealing small vascular structures within tumors. The scan duration of the proposed method is less than a second while current superlocalization techniques require acquisition duration of several minutes. As a result, the proposed technique may be used to obtain scans with enhanced spatial resolution and high temporal resolution, facilitating flow-dynamics monitoring. Our method can also be applied during a breath-hold, reducing the sensitivity to motion artifacts.",1

89318,0,"Nonparametric estimation of mark's distribution of an exponential Shot-noise process In this paper, we consider a nonlinear inverse problem occurring in nuclear science. Gamma rays randomly hit a semiconductor detector which produces an impulse response of electric current. Because the sampling period of the measured current is larger than the mean inter arrival time of photons, the impulse responses associated to different gamma rays can overlap: this phenomenon is known as pileup. In this work, it is assumed that the impulse response is an exponentially decaying function. We propose a novel method to infer the distribution of gamma photon energies from the indirect measurements obtained from the detector. This technique is based on a formula linking the characteristic function of the photon density to a function involving the characteristic function and its derivative of the observations. We establish that our estimator converges to the mark density in uniform norm at a logarithmic rate. A limited Monte-Carlo experiment is provided to support our findings.",1

Simultaneous optical imaging in two bands is enabled by a dichroic beam splitter centered at 567 nm, with Sloan u' and g' bands available on the blue arm and Sloan r', i' and z_s' bands available on the red arm. Additional narrow-band filters will also become available as required.

CHIMERA was primarily developed to enable the characterization of the size distribution of sub-km Kuiper Belt Objects via stellar occultation, a science case that motivates the frame-rate, the simultaneous multi-color imaging and the wide field of view of the instrument. In addition, it also has unique capability in the detection of faint near-Earth asteroids and will be used for the monitoring of short duration transient and periodic sources, particularly those discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), and the upcoming Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).",1

While optomechanical systems and matter-wave interferometry with large clusters are promising candidates to test these models, we here show that using available techniques for atoms in optical lattices, some of these models can be efficiently tested. In particular, we compare unconventional decoherence due to quantum gravity as introduced by Ellis and co-workers [Phys. Lett.

89424,0,"Stimulated Black Hole Evaporation Black holes are extreme expressions of gravity. Their existence is predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity and is supported by observations.

89453,0,"nIFTY galaxy cluster simulations III: The Similarity &amp; Diversity of Galaxies &amp; Subhaloes We examine subhaloes and galaxies residing in a simulated LCDM galaxy cluster ($M^{\rm crit}_{200}=1.1\times10^{15}M_\odot/h$) produced by hydrodynamical codes ranging from classic Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), newer SPH codes, adaptive and moving mesh codes. These codes use subgrid models to capture galaxy formation physics. We compare how well these codes reproduce the same subhaloes/galaxies in gravity only, non-radiative hydrodynamics and full feedback physics runs by looking at the overall subhalo/galaxy distribution and on an individual objects basis. We find the subhalo population is reproduced to within $\lesssim10\%$ for both dark matter only and non-radiative runs, with individual objects showing code-to-code scatter of $\lesssim0.1$ dex, although the gas in non-radiative simulations shows significant scatter. Including feedback physics significantly increases the diversity. Subhalo mass and $V_{max}$ distributions vary by $\approx20\%$. The galaxy populations also show striking code-to-code variations. Although the Tully-Fisher relation is similar in almost all codes, the number of galaxies with $10^{9}M_\odot/h\lesssim M_*\lesssim 10^{12}M_\odot/h$ can differ by a factor of 4. Individual galaxies show code-to-code scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex in stellar mass. Moreover, strong systematic differences exist, with some codes producing galaxies $70\%$ smaller than others. The diversity partially arises from the inclusion/absence of AGN feedback. Our results combined with our companion papers demonstrate that subgrid physics is not just subject to fine-tuning, but the complexity of building galaxies in all environments remains a challenge. We argue even basic galaxy properties, such as the stellar mass to halo mass, should be treated with errors bars of $\sim0.2-0.4$ dex.",1
89484,0,"Nucleosynthesis in the first massive stars The nucleosynthesis in the first massive stars may be constrained by observing the surface composition of long-lived very iron-poor stars born around 10 billion years ago from material enriched by their ejecta. Many interesting clues on physical processes having occurred in the first stars can be obtained just based on nuclear aspects. Two facts are particularly clear, 1) in these first massive stars, mixing must have occurred between the H-burning and the He-burning zone during their nuclear lifetimes; 2) only the outer layers of these massive stars have enriched the material from which the very iron-poor stars, observed today in the halo, have formed. These two basic requirements can be obtained by rotating stellar models at very low metallicity.

89590,0,"Dynamics of spherical distributions of charge with small internal dipolar motion This paper extends the Lorentz-Abraham model of an electron (i.e. the equations of motion for a small spherical shell of charge, which is rigid in its proper frame) to treat a small spherically symmetric charge distribution, allowing for small internal dipolar motion. This is done by dividing the distribution into thin spherical shells (in the continuum limit), and tracking the interactions between shells. Dipolar motion of each constituent spherical shell is allowed along the net dipole moment, but higher order multipole-moments are ignored. The amplitude of dipolar motion of each spherical shell is assumed to be linearly proportional to the net dipole moment. Under these assumptions, low velocity equations of motion are determined for both the center-of-mass motion and net dipolar motion of the distribution. This is then generalized to arbitrary (relativistic) center-of-mass velocity and acceleration, assuming the motion of individual shells is completely in phase or out of phase with the net dipole moment.",1

89967,0,"3D microwave cavity with magnetic flux control and enhanced quality factor Three-dimensional (3D) superconducting microwave cavities with large mode volumes typically have high quality factors ($&gt;10^6$). This is due to a reduced sensitivity to surface dielectric losses, which is the limiting source of dissipation in two-dimensional transmission line resonators. In recent years, 3D microwave cavities have been extensively used for coupling and interacting with superconducting quantum bits (qubits), providing a versatile platform for quantum information processing and hybrid quantum systems. A current issue that has arisen is that 3D superconducting cavities do not permit magnetic field control of qubits embedded in these cavities. In contrast, microwave cavities made of normal metals can be transparent to magnetic fields, but experience a much lower quality factor ($\sim 10^4$), which negates many of the advantages of the 3D architecture. In an attempt to create a device that bridges a gap between these two types of cavities, having magnetic field control and high quality factor, we have created a hybrid 3D cavity. This new cavity is primarily composed of aluminium but also contains a small copper insert. We measured the internal quality factor of the hybrid cavity to be $102000$, which is an order of magnitude improvement over all previously tested copper cavities. An added benefit to that our hybrid cavity possesses is that it also provides an improved thermal link to the sample that superconducting cavities alone cannot provide. In order to demonstrate precise magnetic control within the cavity, we performed spectroscopy of three superconducting qubits placed in the cavity, where individual control of each qubit's frequency was exerted with small wire coils attached to the cavity. A large improvement in quality factor and magnetic field control makes this 3D hybrid cavity an attractive new platform for circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments.",1

The essential component of the interferometer is an image inversion device that inverts the field in the transverse plane about the optical axis, assumed to pass through the centroid of the sources. The performance of the device is analyzed using the Cram\'er-Rao bound applied to the statistics of spatially-unresolved photon counting using photon number-resolving and on-off detectors. The analysis is supported by Monte-Carlo simulations of the maximum likelihood estimator for the source separation, demonstrating the superlocalization effect for separations well below that set by the Rayleigh criterion. Simulations indicating the robustness of SLIVER to mismatch between the optical axis and the centroid are also presented. The results are valid for any imaging system with a circularly symmetric point-spread function.",1

We find extended soft X-ray emission from hot gas around the low intrinsic luminosity (unobscured) AGN ($L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). The temperature structure in the hot gas suggests the presence of a bubble or cavity around the fading AGN ($\mbox{E$_{\rm bub}$} \sim 10^{54} - 10^{55}$ erg). A possible scenario is that this bubble is inflated by the fading AGN, which after changing accretion state is now in a kinetic mode. Other possibilities are that the bubble has been inflated by the past luminous quasar ($L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), or that the temperature gradient is an indication of a shock front from a superwind driven by the AGN. We discuss the possible scenarios and the implications for the AGN-host galaxy interaction, as well as an analogy between AGN and X-ray binaries lifecycles. We conclude that the AGN could inject mechanical energy into the host galaxy at the end of its lifecycle, and thus provide a source for mechanical feedback, in a similar way as observed for X-ray binaries.",1

We provide a complete group classification using two approaches which form the essence of this paper and argue that this can be applied to systems of autonomous nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equations which occur in many physical applications.,1
90470,0,"Ultra-diffuse galaxies: the high-spin tail of the abundant dwarf galaxy population Recent observations have revealed the existence of an abundant population of faint, low surface brightness (SB) galaxies, which appear to be numerous and ubiquitous in nearby galaxy clusters, including the Virgo, Coma and Fornax clusters. With median stellar masses of dwarf galaxies, these ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have unexpectedly large sizes, corresponding to a mean SB of $24\lesssim\langle\mu_e\rangle_r\ {\rm mag}^{-1} {\rm arcsec}^2\lesssim27$ within the effective radius. We show that the UDG population represents the tail of galaxies formed in dwarf-sized haloes with higher-than-average angular momentum. By adopting the standard model of disk formation -- in which the size of galaxies is set by the spin of the halo -- we recover both the abundance of UDGs as a function of the host cluster mass and the distribution of sizes within the UDG population. According to this model, UDGs are not failed $L_*$ galaxies, but genuine dwarfs, and their low SB is not uniquely connected to the harsh cluster environment. We therefore expect a correspondingly abundant population of UDGs in the field, with likely different morphologies and colours.",1
90529,0,"Topological Quantum Computation with Non-Abelian Anyons in Fractional Quantum Hall States We review the general strategy of topologically protected quantum information processing based on non-Abelian anyons, in which quantum information is encoded into the fusion channels of pairs of anyons and in fusion paths for multi-anyon states, realized in two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall systems. The quantum gates which are needed for the quantum information processing in these multi-qubit registers are implemented by exchange or braiding of the non-Abelian anyons that are at fixed positions in two-dimensional coordinate space. As an example we consider the Pfaffian topological quantum computer based on the fractional quantum Hall state with filling factor $\nu_H=5/2$. The elementary qubits are constructed by localizing Ising anyons on fractional quantum Hall antidots and various quantum gates, such as the Hadamard gate, phase gates and CNOT, are explicitly realized by braiding. We also discuss the appropriate experimental signatures which could eventually be used to detect non-Abelian anyons in Coulomb blockaded quantum Hall islands.",1
90614,0,The use of Slater-type spinor orbitals in algebraic solution of two-center Dirac equation The use of Slater-type spinor orbitals in algebraic solution of the Dirac equation is investigated. The one- and two-center integrals constitute the matrix elements arising in generalized eigenvalue equation for one-electron atoms and molecules are evaluated over Slater-type spinor orbitals via ellipsoidal coordinates. These integrals are calculated through numerical global-adaptive method with Gauss-Kronrod numerical integration extension. The calculations are performed for electronic structure of ground and excited states of one-electron atoms and diatomic molecules. The screening constants are allowed to be variationally optimum values for given nuclear separation. The obtained results are compaired with the results those found in the literature. The procedures discussed in this work are capable of yielding highly accurate relativistic two-center one-electron integrals for all ranges of orbital parameters. Besides provides an efficient way to overcome the problems that arise in relativistic calculations.,1

This paper describes both the characteristics of the radiation environment in Geo-Synchronous orbit and the mechanisms by which this radiation generates backgrounds in photon detectors.

90952,0,"Edge-promoting reconstruction of absorption and diffusivity in optical tomography In optical tomography a physical body is illuminated with near-infrared light and the resulting outward photon flux is measured at the object boundary. The goal is to reconstruct internal optical properties of the body, such as absorption and diffusivity. In this work, it is assumed that the imaged object is composed of an approximately homogeneous background with clearly distinguishable embedded inhomogeneities. An algorithm for finding the maximum a posteriori estimate for the absorption and diffusion coefficients is introduced assuming an edge-preferring prior and an additive Gaussian measurement noise model. The method is based on iteratively combining a lagged diffusivity step and a linearization of the measurement model of diffuse optical tomography with priorconditioned LSQR. The performance of the reconstruction technique is tested via three-dimensional numerical experiments with simulated measurement data.",1

91065,0,"MUSE crowded field 3D spectroscopy of over 12,000 stars in the globular cluster NGC 6397 - II. Probing the internal dynamics and the presence of a central black hole We present a detailed analysis of the kinematics of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397 based on more than ~18,000 spectra obtained with the novel integral field spectrograph MUSE. While NGC 6397 is often considered a core collapse cluster, our analysis suggests a flattening of the surface brightness profile at the smallest radii. Although it is among the nearest globular clusters, the low velocity dispersion of NGC 6397 of &lt;5km/s imposes heavy demands on the quality of the kinematical data. We show that despite its limited spectral resolution, MUSE reaches an accuracy of 1km/s in the analysis of stellar spectra. We find slight evidence for a rotational component in the cluster and the velocity dispersion profile that we obtain shows a mild central cusp. To investigate the nature of this feature, we calculate spherical Jeans models and compare these models to our kinematical data. This comparison shows that if a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed, the addition of an intermediate-mass black hole with a mass of 600M_sun brings the model predictions into agreement with our data, and therefore could be at the origin of the velocity dispersion profile. We further investigate cases with varying mass-to-light ratios and find that a compact dark stellar component can also explain our observations. However, such a component would closely resemble the black hole from the constant mass-to-light ratio models as this component must be confined to the central ~5arcsec of the cluster and must have a similar mass. Independent constraints on the distribution of stellar remnants in the cluster or kinematic measurements at the highest possible spatial resolution should be able to distinguish the two alternatives.",1
91174,0,"Dynamics of stream-subhalo interactions We develop a formalism for modelling the impact of dark matter subhaloes on cold thin streams. Our formalism models the formation of a gap in a stream in angle-frequency space and is able to handle general stream and impact geometry. We analyse an $N$-body simulation of a cold stream formed from a progenitor on an eccentric orbit in an axisymmetric potential, which is perturbed by a direct impact from a $10^8 M_\odot$ subhalo, and produce a complete generative model of the perturbed stream that matches the simulation well at a range of times. We show how the results in angle-frequency space can be related to physical properties of the gaps and that previous results for more constrained simulations are recovered. We demonstrate how our results are dependent upon the mass of the subhalo and the location of the impact along the stream. We find that gaps formed far downstream grow more rapidly than those closer to the progenitor due to the more ordered nature of the stream members far from the progenitor. Additionally, we show that the minimum gap density plateaus in time at a value that decreases with increasing subhalo mass.",1
91468,0,"X-ray Performance of Back-Side Illuminated Type of Kyoto's X-ray Astronomical SOI Pixel Sensor, XRPIX We have been developing X-ray SOI pixel Sensors, called ""XRPIX"", for future X-ray astronomy satellites that enable us to observe in the wide energy band of 0.5-40 keV. Since XRPIXs have the circuitry layer with a thickness of about 8 {\mu}m in the front side of the sensor, it is impossible to detect low energy X-rays with a front-illuminated type. So, we have been developing back-illuminated type of XRPIX with a less 1 {\mu}m dead layer in the back-side, which enables the sensitivity to reach 0.5 keV. We produced two types of back-side illuminated (BI) XRPIXs, one of which is produced in ""Pizza process"" which LBNL developed and the other is processed in the ion implantation and laser annealing. We irradiated both of the BI-XRPIXs with soft X-ray and investigate soft X-ray performance of them. We report results from soft X-ray evaluation test of the device.",1
91523,0,"Hadoop on HPC: Integrating Hadoop and Pilot-based Dynamic Resource Management High-performance computing platforms such as supercomputers have traditionally been designed to meet the compute demands of scientific applications. Consequently, they have been architected as producers and not consumers of data. The Apache Hadoop ecosystem has evolved to meet the requirements of data processing applications and has addressed many of the limitations of HPC platforms. There exist a class of scientific applications however, that need the collective capabilities of traditional high-performance computing environments and the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. For example, the scientific domains of bio-molecular dynamics, genomics and network science need to couple traditional computing with Hadoop/Spark based analysis. We investigate the critical question of how to present the capabilities of both computing environments to such scientific applications. Whereas this questions needs answers at multiple levels, we focus on the design of resource management middleware that might support the needs of both. We propose extensions to the Pilot-Abstraction to provide a unifying resource management layer. This is an important step that allows applications to integrate HPC stages (e.g. simulations) to data analytics. Many supercomputing centers have started to officially support Hadoop environments, either in a dedicated environment or in hybrid deployments using tools such as myHadoop. This typically involves many intrinsic, environment-specific details that need to be mastered, and often swamp conceptual issues like: How best to couple HPC and Hadoop application stages? How to explore runtime trade-offs (data localities vs. data movement)? This paper provides both conceptual understanding and practical solutions to the integrated use of HPC and Hadoop environments.",1
91665,0,"Determining the type of orbits in the central regions of barred galaxies We use a simple dynamical model which consists of a harmonic oscillator and a spherical component, in order to investigate the regular or chaotic character of orbits in a barred galaxy with a central spherically symmetric nucleus. Our aim is to explore how the basic parameters of the galactic system influence the nature of orbits, by computing in each case the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of different types of regular orbits. We also give emphasis to the types of regular orbits that support either the formation of nuclear rings or the barred structure of the galaxy. We provide evidence that the traditional x1 orbital family does not always dominate in barred galaxy models since we found several other types of resonant orbits which can also support the barred structure. We also found that sparse enough nuclei, fast rotating bars and high energy models can support the galactic bars. On the other hand, weak bars, dense central nuclei, slowly rotating bars and low energy models favor the formation of nuclear rings. We also compare our results with previous related work.",1
91742,0,"Active galactic nuclei at z ~ 1.5: III. Accretion discs and black hole spin This is the third paper in a series describing the spectroscopic properties of a sample of 39 AGN at $z \sim 1.5$, selected to cover a large range in black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and Eddington ratio ($L/L_{Edd}$). In this paper, we continue the analysis of the VLT/X-shooter observations of our sample with the addition of 9 new sources. We use an improved Bayesian procedure, which takes into account intrinsic reddening, and improved $M_{BH}$ estimates, to fit thin accretion disc (AD) models to the observed spectra and constrain the spin parameter ($a_*$) of the central black holes. We can fit 37 out of 39 AGN with the thin AD model, and for those with satisfactory fits, we obtain constraints on the spin parameter of the BHs, with the constraints becoming generally less well defined with decreasing BH mass. Our spin parameter estimates range from $\sim$$-$0.6 to maximum spin for our sample, and our results are consistent with the ""spin-up"" scenario of BH spin evolution. We also discuss how the results of our analysis vary with the inclusion of non-simultaneous GALEX photometry in our thin AD fitting. Simultaneous spectra covering the rest-frame optical through far-UV are necessary to definitively test the thin AD theory and obtain the best constraints on the spin parameter.",1
91932,0,"Atom interferometry in the presence of an external test mass The influence of an external test mass on the phase of the signal of an atom interferometer is studied theoretically. Using traditional techniques in atom optics based on the density matrix equations in the Wigner representation, we are able to extract the various contributions to the phase of the signal associated with the classical motion of the atoms, the quantum correction to this motion resulting from atomic recoil that is produced when the atoms interact with Raman field pulses, and quantum corrections to the atomic motion that occur in the time between the Raman field pulses. By increasing the effective wave vector associated with the Raman field pulses using modified field parameters, we can increase the sensitivity of the signal to the point where the quantum corrections can be measured. The expressions that are derived can be evaluated numerically to isolate the contribution to the signal from an external test mass. The regions of validity of the exact and approximate expressions are determined.",1
92172,0,"Effect of a tunnel barrier on the scattering from a Majorana bound state in an Andreev billiard We calculate the joint distribution $P(S,Q)$ of the scattering matrix $S$ and time-delay matrix $Q=-i\hbar S^\dagger dS/dE$ of a chaotic quantum dot coupled by point contacts to metal electrodes. While $S$ and $Q$ are statistically independent for ballistic coupling, they become correlated for tunnel coupling. We relate the ensemble averages of $Q$ and $S$ and thereby obtain the average density of states at the Fermi level. We apply this to a calculation of the effect of a tunnel barrier on the Majorana resonance in a topological superconductor. We find that the presence of a Majorana bound state is hidden in the density of states and in the thermal conductance if even a single scattering channel has unit tunnel probability. The electrical conductance remains sensitive to the appearance of a Majorana bound state, and we calculate the variation of the average conductance through a topological phase transition.",1

The total number of globular clusters (GCs) in a galaxy rises continuously with the galaxy luminosity L, while the relative number of galaxies decreases with L following the Schechter function.

It is shown that GCs, in this universal sense, are most commonly found in galaxies within a narrow range around $L_{\star}$. In addition, blue (metal-poor) GCs outnumber the red (metal-richer) ones globally by 4 to 1 when all galaxies are added, pointing to the conclusion that the earliest stages of galaxy formation were especially favorable to forming massive, dense star clusters.",1

92826,0,"Spectral statistics across the many-body localization transition The many-body localization transition (MBLT) between ergodic and many-body localized phase in disordered interacting systems is a subject of much recent interest. Statistics of eigenenergies is known to be a powerful probe of crossovers between ergodic and integrable systems in simpler examples of quantum chaos. We consider the evolution of the spectral statistics across the MBLT, starting with mapping to a Brownian motion process that analytically relates the spectral properties to the statistics of matrix elements. We demonstrate that the flow from Wigner-Dyson to Poisson statistics is a two-stage process. First, fractal enhancement of matrix elements upon approaching the MBLT from the metallic side produces an effective power-law interaction between energy levels, and leads to a plasma model for level statistics. At the second stage, the gas of eigenvalues has local interaction and level statistics belongs to a semi-Poisson universality class. We verify our findings numerically on the XXZ spin chain. We provide a microscopic understanding of the level statistics across the MBLT and discuss implications for the transition that are strong constraints on possible theories.",1

The eclipsing dwarf nova binary IP Peg, observed during the end phase of a rise to outburst, shows strong Balmer and Helium emission lines in its spectra, with asymmetric double peaked velocity profiles produced in the accretion disc around the white dwarf. To reveal the two armed spiral on the accretion disc, we de-project the observed emission line profiles onto a Doppler coordinate frame, a technique known as Doppler tomography. The two armed spiral structure we see in the Doppler tomograms is expected to form when the disc becomes sufficiently large in outburst so that the tides induced by the secondary star can excite waves in the outer disc. Such spiral waves have been predicted in studies of tidal effects in discs and are fundamental in understanding the angular momentum budget of accretion discs.",1

93209,0,Attractor-repeller pair of topological zero-modes in a nonlinear quantum walk The quantum-mechanical counterpart of a classical random walk offers a rich dynamics that has recently been shown to include topologically protected bound states (zero-modes) at boundaries or domain walls. Here we show that a topological zero-mode may acquire a dynamical role in the presence of nonlinearities. We consider a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk that combines zero-modes with a particle-conserving nonlinear relaxation mechanism. The presence of both particle-hole and chiral symmetry converts two zero-modes of opposite chirality into an attractor-repeller pair of the nonlinear dynamics. This makes it possible to steer the walker towards a domain wall and trap it there.,1

I must confess that the main reason for my choice of Gasiorowicz (1974) is affective, as it was the textbook where I first learned the basic principles of quantum mechanics. Beyond my personal taste, I now recognize that Gasiorowicz (1974) is still a very good textbook on quantum mechanics, with a rigorous theoretical approach accompanied by a wide collection of applications.

93270,0,"Piecewise linearity in the $GW$ approximation for accurate quasiparticle energy predictions We identify the deviation from the straight line error (DSLE) -- i.e., the spurious non-linearity of the total energy as a function of fractional particle number -- as the main source for the discrepancy between experimental vertical ionization energies and theoretical quasiparticle energies, as obtained from the $GW$ and $GW$+SOSEX approximations to many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). For self-consistent calculations, we show that $GW$ suffers from a small DSLE. Conversely, for perturbative $G_0W_0$ and $G_0W_0$+SOSEX calculations the DSLE depends on the starting point. We exploit this starting-point dependence to reduce (or completely eliminate) the DSLE. We find that the agreement with experiment increases as the DSLE reduces. DSLE-minimized schemes, thus, emerge as promising avenues for future developments in MBPT.",1
93436,0,"A New Perspective of the Radio Bright Zone at The Galactic Center: Feedback from Nuclear Activities New observations of Sgr A have been carried out with the VLA using the broadband (2 GHz) continuum mode at 5.5 GHz, covering the central 30 pc region of the RBZ at the Galactic center. Using the MS-MFS algorithms in CASA, we have imaged Sgr A with a resolution of 1"", achieving an rms 8 $\mu$Jy/beam, and a dynamic range 100,000:1.The radio image is compared with X-ray, CN emission-line and Paschen-$\alpha$ images obtained using Chandra, SMA and HST/NICMOS, respectively.

The ""Sgr A West Wings"" extend 5 pc from the NW and SE tips of the ionized ""Mini-spiral"" in Sgr A West to positions located 2.9 and 2.4 arc min to the NW and SE of Sgr A*, respectively. The NW wing, along with several other prominent features, including the ""NW Streamers"", form an elongated radio lobe (NW lobe), oriented nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane. This radio lobe, with a size of 14.4 pc x 7.3 pc, has a known X-ray counterpart. A row of three thermally emitting rings is observed in the NW lobe. A field containing numerous amorphous radio blobs extends for a distance of ~2 arc min beyond the tip of the SE wing; these features coincide with the SE X-ray lobe. Most of the amorphous radio blobs in the NW and SE lobes have Paschen-$\alpha$ counterparts, suggesting that a shock interaction of ambient gas concentrations with a collimated nuclear wind (outflow) that may be driven by radiation force from the central star cluster within the CND. Finally, we remark on a prominent radio feature located within the shell of the Sgr A East SNR.

We explore different correlations between their emission line properties, as well as the correlations with the other emission lines from the spectral range. We find several interesting correlations and we can outline the most interesting results as follows. (i) There is a kinematical connection between the UV and optical Fe II lines, indicating that the UV and optical Fe II lines originate from the outer part of the broad line region, so-called intermediate line region; (ii) The unexplained anticorrelations of the optical Fe II (EW Fe II$_{opt}$) versus EW [O III] 5007 \AA\ and EW Fe II$_{opt}$ versus FWHM Hbeta have not been detected for the UV Fe II lines; (iii) The significant averaged redshift in the UV Fe II lines, which is not present in optical Fe II, indicates an inflow in the UV Fe II emitting clouds, and probably their asymmetric distribution. (iv) Also, we confirm the anticorrelation between the intensity ratio of the optical and UV Fe II lines and FWHM of Hbeta, and we find the anticorrelations of this ratio with the widths of Mg II 2800 \AA, optical Fe II and UV Fe II.

93542,0,"Helium Stars: Towards an Understanding of Wolf-Rayet Evolution Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are massive stars that have lost most or all of their hydrogen via powerful stellar winds. Recent observations have indicated that hydrogen-free WR stars have cooler temperatures than those predicted by current evolutionary models. To investigate how varying mass-loss rate affects WR evolution, we have created a grid of pure helium star models. We compare our results with Galactic and LMC WR observations and show that the temperature ranges of observed WR stars can be reproduced by varying the mass-loss rate, which effectively determines the size of the helium envelope around the core. We also find that WN and WO stars arise from more massive stars, whereas WC stars come from lower masses. This contradicts the standard Conti scenario by which WN and WC stars evolve in an age sequence. We also predict the magnitudes of our models at core-collapse and compare with observations of nearby progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae. We confirm the findings of previous studies that suggest WR stars are the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae: the progenitors would remain unobserved except in the cases where the progenitor is a low-mass helium giant, as is the case of iPTF13bvn.",1

We show the reason why in the superintegrable case the eigenspace is degenerate, but not in the general case. We then show that the eigenspaces of special CSOS models descending from the chiral Potts model are also degenerate. The existence of an $L({\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ quantum loop algebra (or subalgebra) in these models is established by showing that the Serre relations hold for the generators. The highest weight polynomial (or the Drinfeld polynomial) of the representation is obtained by using the method of Baxter for the superintegrable case. As a byproduct, the eigenvalues of all such CSOS models are given explicitly.",1
93555,0,"Free-Surface Hydrodynamics in Conformal Variables: Are Equations of Free-Surface Hydrodynamics on Deep Water Integrable? The hypothesis on complete integrability of equations describing the potential motion of incompressible ideal fluid with free surface in 2-D space in presence and absence of gravity was formulated by Dyachenko and Zakharov in 1994 [1]. Later on, the same authors found that these equations have indefinite number of additional motion constants [2] that was an argument in support of the integrability hypothesis. In this article we formulate another argument in favor of this conjecture. It is known [3] that the free-surface equations have an exotic solution that keeps the surface flat but describes the compression of the whole mass of fluid. In this article we show that the free-surface hydrodynamic is integrable if the motion can be treated as a finite amplitude perturbation of the compressed fluid solution. Integrability makes possible to construct an indefinite number of exact solutions of the Euler equations with free surface.",1

The 2016 I-band light-curve is an exact replica, even in the most minute details, of that for the 2010 eruption. The maximum is inferred to have occurred on 2016 Jan 21.2 at I=11.5 mag, corresponding to an absolute magnitude M(I)=-7.15. A ~1 day plateau is present in all bands about six days past optical maximum, simultaneous with the emergence of super-soft X-ray emission in Swift observations, signalling the widespread ionization of the ejecta. The nova entered a much longer plateau about 9 days past maximum, governed by the brightness of the white dwarf, now directly visible and still nuclearly burning on its surface. An outburst recurrence mean period of ~955 days (2.6 yrs) would fit both the OGLE inter-season gaps and the observed intervals between previous outburts.",1
93681,0,"Covariant Magnetic Connection Hypersurfaces In the single fluid, nonrelativistic, ideal-Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma description magnetic field lines play a fundamental role by defining dynamically preserved ""magnetic connections"" between plasma elements. Here we show how the concept of magnetic connection needs to be generalized in the case of a relativistic MHD description where we require covariance under arbitrary Lorentz transformations. This is performed by defining 2-D {\it magnetic connection hypersurfaces} in the 4-D Minkowski space. This generalization accounts for the loss of simultaneity between spatially separated events in different frames and is expected to provide a powerful insight into the 4-D geometry of electromagnetic fields when ${\bf E} \cdot {\bf B} = 0$.",1
93695,0,"Uncertain for A Century: Quantum Mechanics and The Dilemma of Interpretation Quantum Mechanics, the physical theory describing the microworld, represents one of science's greatest triumphs. It lies at the root of all modern digital technologies and offers unparalleled correspondence between prediction and experiments. Remarkably, however, after more than 100 years it is still unclear what quantum mechanics means in terms of basic philosophical questions about the nature of reality. While there are many interpretations of the mathematical machinery of quantum physics, there remains no experimental means to distinguish between most of them. In this contribution, (based on a discussion at the NYAS), I wish to consider the ways in which the enduring lack of an agreed upon interpretation of quantum physics influences a number of critical philosophical debates about physics and reality. I briefly review two problems effected by quantum interpretations: the meaning of the term 'Universe' and the nature of consciousness. In what follows I am explicitly not advocating for any particular quantum interpretation. Instead, I am interested in how the explicit inability of modern physics to experimentally distinguish between interpretations with wildly divergent ontological/epistemological implications plays into discussions of physics and its description of the world.",1

These processes serve as asymmetric transport models and their algebraic structure easily allows to deduce duality properties of the systems. The results include: (a) the asymmetric version of the Inclusion Process, which is self-dual; (b) the diffusion limit of this process, which is a natural asymmetric analogue of the Brownian Energy Process and which turns out to have the symmetric Inclusion Process as a dual process; (c) the asymmetric analogue of the KMP Process, which also turns out to have a symmetric dual process. We give applications of the various duality relations by computing exponential moments of the current.",1
93979,0,"Anchoring historical sequences using a new source of astro-chronological tie-points The discovery of past spikes in atmospheric radiocarbon activity, caused by major solar energetic particle events, has opened up new possibilities for high-precision chronometry. The two spikes, or Miyake Events, have now been widely identified in tree-rings that grew in the years 775 and 994 CE. Furthermore, all other plant material that grew in these years would also have incorporated the anomalously high concentrations of radiocarbon. Crucially, some plant-based artefacts, such as papyrus documents, timber beams and linen garments, can also be allocated to specific positions within long, currently unfixed, historical sequences. Thus, Miyake Events represent a new source of tie-points that could provide the means for anchoring early chronologies to the absolute timescale. Here, we explore this possibility, outlining the most expeditious approaches, the current challenges and obstacles, and how they might best be overcome.",1

94364,0,"The asymptotically flat scalar-flat Yamabe problem with boundary We consider two cases of the asymptotically flat scalar-flat Yamabe problem on a non-compact manifold with boundary, in dimension $n\geq3$. First, following arguments of Cantor and Brill in the compact case, we show that given an asymptotically flat metric $g$, there is a conformally equivalent asymptotically flat scalar-flat metric that agrees with $g$ on the boundary. We then replace the metric boundary condition with a condition on the mean curvature: Given a function $f$ on the boundary that is not too large, we show that there is an asymptotically flat scalar-flat metric, conformally equivalent to $g$ whose boundary mean curvature is given by $f$. The latter case involves solving an elliptic PDE with critical exponent using the method of sub- and supersolutions. Both results require the usual assumption that the Sobolev quotient is positive.",1
94470,0,"Semi-Analytic Model Predictions of the Galaxy Population in Proto-clusters We investigate the galaxy population in simulated proto-cluster regions using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, coupled to merger trees extracted from N-body simulations. We select the most massive clusters at redshift $z=0$ from our set of simulations, and follow their main progenitors back in time. The analysis shows that proto-cluster regions are dominated by central galaxies and their number decreases with time as many become satellites, clustering around the central object. In agreement with observations, we find an increasing velocity dispersion with cosmic time, the increase being faster for satellites. The analysis shows that proto-clusters are very extended regions, $\gtrsim 20 \, Mpc$ at $z \gtrsim 1$. The fraction of galaxies in proto-cluster regions that are not progenitor of cluster galaxies varies with redshift, stellar mass and area considered. It is about 20-30 per cent for galaxies with stellar mass $\sim 10^9\,{\rm M}_{\sun}$, while negligible for the most massive galaxies considered. Nevertheless, these objects have properties similar to those of progenitors. We investigate the building-up of the passive-sequence in clusters, and find that their progenitors are on average always active at any redshift of interest of proto-clusters. The main mechanism which quenches their star formation is the removal of the hot gas reservoir at the time of accretion. The later galaxies are accreted (become satellite), and the more the cold gas available, the longer the time spent as active. Central galaxies are active over all redshift range considered, although a non-negligible fraction of them become passive at redshift $z&lt;1$, due to strong feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei.",1
94619,0,"A simple and straightforward technique for single shot measurement of terahertz profile A new detection scheme capable of acquiring the entire spatiotemporal profile of terahertz radiation in a single laser shot is being demonstrated. The design allows temporal resolution of the order of transform-limited pulse duration of the probe, which is an absolute benefit over the compromised resolution of otherwise prevalent single-shot detection schemes based on spectral encoding of terahertz waveform on a temporally chirped readout pulse. This makes the technique perfectly suitable for sensitive spectroscopy studies. The single shot detection technique presented here relies on space-to-time mapping of terahertz temporal profile by use of a converging probe intensity front. The present approach does not require any specialized optics and is implemented using very straightforward alignment procedure. It has shown to reproduce the temporal waveform of terahertz radiation faithfully.",1
94625,0,"Segmentation-free x-ray energy spectrum estimation for computed tomography X-ray energy spectrum plays an essential role in imaging and related tasks. Due to the high photon flux of clinical CT scanners, most of the spectrum estimation methods are indirect and are usually suffered from various limitations. The recently proposed indirect transmission measurement-based method requires at least the segmentation of one material, which is insufficient for CT images of highly noisy and with artifacts. To combat for the bottleneck of spectrum estimation using segmented CT images, in this study, we develop a segmentation-free indirect transmission measurement based energy spectrum estimation method using dual-energy material decomposition. The general principle of the method is to compare polychromatic forward projection with raw projection to calibrate a set of unknown weights which are used to express the unknown spectrum together with a set of model spectra. After applying dual-energy material decomposition using high- and low-energy raw projection data, polychromatic forward projection is conducted on material-specific images. The unknown weights are then iteratively updated to minimize the difference between the raw projection and estimated projection. Both numerical simulations and experimental head phantom are used to evaluate the proposed method. The results indicate that the method provides accurate estimate of the spectrum and it may be attractive for dose calculations, artifacts correction and other clinical applications.",1
94699,0,"A tabulation of the bound-state energies of atomic hydrogen We present tables for the bound-state energies for atomic hydrogen. The tabulated energies include the hyperfine structure, and thus this work extends the work of Rev. Mod. Phys. {\bf 84}, 1527 (2012), which excludes hyperfine structure. The tabulation includes corrections of the hyperfine structure due to the anomalous moment of the electron, due to the finite mass of the proton, and due to off-diagonal matrix elements of the hyperfine Hamiltonian. These corrections are treated incorrectly in most other works. Simple formulas valid for all quantum numbers are presented for the hyperfine corrections. The tabulated energies have uncertainties of less than 1 kHz for all states. This accuracy is possible because of the recent precision measurement [Nature, {\bf 466}, 213 (2010); Science, {\bf 339}, 417] of the proton radius. The effect of this new radius on the energy levels is also tabulated, and the energies are compared to precision measurements of atomic hydrogen energy intervals.",1
94726,0,"A Steep Slope and Small Scatter for the High-Mass End of the L-$\sigma$ Relation at $z\sim0.55$ We measure the intrinsic relation between velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) and luminosity ($L$) for massive, luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at redshift $z \sim 0.55$. We achieve unprecedented precision by using a sample of 600,000 galaxies with spectra from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the third Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), covering a range of stellar masses $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We deconvolve the effects of photometric errors, limited spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio, and red--blue galaxy confusion using a novel hierarchical Bayesian formalism that is generally applicable to any combination of photometric and spectroscopic observables. For an L-$\sigma$ relation of the form $L \propto \sigma^{\beta}$, we find $\beta = 7.8 \pm 1.1$ for $\sigma$ corrected to the effective radius, and a very small intrinsic scatter of $s = 0.047 \pm 0.004$ in $\log_{10} \sigma$ at fixed $L$. No significant redshift evolution is found for these parameters. The evolution of the zero-point within the redshift range considered is consistent with the passive evolution of a galaxy population that formed at redshift $z=2-3$, assuming single stellar populations. An analysis of previously reported results seems to indicate that the passively-evolved high-mass L-$\sigma$ relation at $z\sim0.55$ is consistent with the one measured at $z=0.1$. Our results, in combination with those presented in Montero-Dorta et al. (2014), provide a detailed description of the high-mass end of the red sequence (RS) at $z\sim0.55$. This characterization, in the light of previous literature, suggest that the high-mass RS distribution corresponds to the ""core"" elliptical population.",1
94748,0,"Reformulation of the strong field approximation for light-matter interactions We consider the interaction of hydrogen-like atoms with a strong laser field and show that the strong field approximation and all its variants may be grouped into a set of families of approximation schemes. This is done by introducing an ansatz describing the electron wave packet as the sum of the initial state wave function times a phase factor and a function which is the perturbative solution in the Coulomb potential of an inhomogeneous time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. It is the phase factor that characterizes a given family. In each of these families, the velocity and length gauge version of the approximation scheme lead to the same results at each order in the Coulomb potential. By contrast, irrespective of the gauge, approximation schemes belonging to different families give different results. Furthermore, this new formulation of the strong field approximations allows us to gain deeper insight into the validity of the strong field approximation schemes. In particular, we address two important questions: the role of the Coulomb potential in the output channel and the convergence of the perturbative series in the Coulomb potential. In all the physical situations we consider here, our results are compared to those obtained by solving numerically the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation.",1

94863,0,"HST-COS Observations of AGNs. III. Spectral Constraints in the Lyman Continuum from Composite COS/G140L Data The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are important diagnostics of both accretion disk physics and their contribution to the metagalactic ionizing UV background. Though the mean AGN spectrum is well characterized with composite spectra at wavelengths greater than 912 Angstroms, the shorter-wavelength extreme-UV (EUV) remains poorly studied. In this third paper in a series on the spectra of AGNs, we combine 11 new spectra taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope with archival spectra to characterize the typical EUV spectral slope of AGNs from $\lambda_{\rm rest}\sim 850~{\rm Angstroms}$ down to $\lambda_{\rm rest}\sim 425~{\rm Angstroms}$. Parameterizing this slope as a power law, we obtain $F_\nu\propto \nu^{ -0.72\pm 0.26}$, but we also discuss the limitations and systematic uncertainties of this model. We identify broad emission features in this spectral region, including emission due to ions of O, Ne, Mg, and other species, and we limit the intrinsic HeI 504 Angstrom photoelectric absorption edge opacity to $\tau_{\rm HeI}&lt;0.047$.",1

Our measurements reveal 10 different scattering wave vectors, which can be understood and precisely reproduced with a theory that takes into account the shape, spin texture, and momentum-dependent propagation of the Fermi arc surface states into the bulk.

The unstable isotope, $^{7}$Be, should has been created during the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) of these novae and decays to form $^{7}$Li within a short period (a half-life of 53.22 days). Confirmations of $^{7}$Be are the second and the third ones following the first case found in V339 Del by Tajitsu et al. (2015). The blue-shifted absorption line systems in both novae are clearly divided into two velocity components, both of which contain $^{7}$Be. This means that the absorbing gases in both velocity components consist of products of TNR. We estimate amounts of $^{7}$Be produced during outbursts of both novae and conclude that significant $^{7}$Li should have been created. These findings strongly suggest that the explosive production of $^{7}$Li via the reaction $^{3}$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{7}$Be and subsequent decay to $^{7}$Li occurs frequently among classical novae and contributes to the process of the Galactic Li enrichment.",1
95114,0,"Glass-on-Glass Fabrication of Bottle-Shaped Tunable Micro-Lasers and Their Applications We describe a novel method for making microbottle-shaped lasers by using a CO$_2$ laser to melt Er:Yb glass onto silica microcapillaries or fibres. This is realised by the fact that the two glasses have different melting points. The CO$_2$ laser power is controlled to flow the doped glass around the silica cylinder. In the case of a capillary, the resulting geometry is a hollow, microbottle-shaped resonator. This is a simple method for fabricating a number of glass WGM lasers with a wide range of sizes on a single, micron-scale structure. The Er:Yb doped glass outer layer is pumped at 980 nm via a tapered optical fibre and whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing is recorded around 1535 nm. This structure facilitates a new way to thermo-optically tune the microlaser modes by passing gas through the capillary. The cooling effect of the gas flow shifts the WGMs towards shorter wavelengths, thus thermal tuning of the lasing modes over 70 GHz is achieved. Results are fitted using the theory of hot wire anemometry, allowing the flow rate to be calibrated with a flow sensitivity as high as 100 GHz/sccm. Strain tuning of the microlaser modes by up to 50 GHz is also demonstrated.",1

95214,0,"Suppression and restoration of disorder-induced light localization mediated by PT-symmetry breaking We uncover that the breaking point of the PT-symmetry in optical waveguide arrays has a dramatic impact on light localization induced by the off-diagonal disorder. Specifically, when the gain/loss control parameter approaches a critical value at which PT-symmetry breaking occurs, a fast growth of the coupling between neighboring waveguides causes diffraction to dominate to an extent that light localization is strongly suppressed and statistically averaged width of the output pattern substantially increases. Beyond the symmetry-breaking point localization is gradually restored, although in this regime the power of localized modes grows upon propagation. The strength of localization monotonically increases with disorder at both, broken and unbroken PT-symmetry.",1

95271,0,"The Surface Density Profile of the Galactic Disk from the Terminal Velocity Curve The mass distribution of the Galactic disk is constructed from the terminal velocity curve and the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation. Mass models numerically quantifying the detailed surface density profiles are tabulated.

The present inter-arm location of the solar neighborhood may have a somewhat lower stellar surface density than average for the solar circle. The Milky Way appears to be a normal spiral galaxy that obeys scaling relations like the Tully-Fisher relation, the size-mass relation, and the disk maximality-surface brightness relation. The stellar disk is maximal, and the spiral arms are massive. The bumps and wiggles in the terminal velocity curve correspond to known spiral features (e.g., the Centaurus Arm is a $\sim 50\%$ overdensity). The rotation curve switches between positive and negative over scales of hundreds of parsecs. The rms amplitude $\langle$$|$$dV/dR$$|^2$$\rangle$$^{1/2} \approx 14$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, implying that commonly neglected terms in the Jeans equations may be non-negligible. The spherically averaged local dark matter density is $\rho_{0,DM} \approx 0.009$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$ (0.3 GeV cm$^{-3}$). Adiabatic compression of the dark matter halo may help reconcile the Milky Way with the $c$-$V_{200}$ relation expected in $\Lambda$CDM while also helping to mitigate the too big to fail problem, but it remains difficult to reconcile the inner bulge/bar dominated region with a cuspy halo.

95308,0,"A quantization of the harmonic analysis on the infinite-dimensional unitary group The present work stemmed from the study of the problem of harmonic analysis on the infinite-dimensional unitary group U(\infty). That problem consisted in the decomposition of a certain 4-parameter family of unitary representations, which replace the nonexisting two-sided regular representation (Olshanski, J. Funct. Anal., 2003, arXiv:0109193). The required decomposition is governed by certain probability measures on an infinite-dimensional space \Omega, which is a dual object to U(\infty). A way to describe those measures is to convert them into determinantal point processes on the real line, it turned out that their correlation kernels are computable in explicit form --- they admit a closed expression in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function 2-F-1 (Borodin and Olshanski, Ann. Math., 2005, arXiv:0109194). In the present work we describe a (nonevident) q-discretization of the whole construction. This leads us to a new family of determinantal point processes. We reveal its connection with an exotic finite system of q-discrete orthogonal polynomials --- the so-called pseudo big q-Jacobi polynomials. The new point processes live on a double q-lattice and we show that their correlation kernels are expressed through the basic hypergeometric function 2-\phi-1. A crucial novel ingredient of our approach is an extended version G of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph (the conventional graph describes the Gelfand-Tsetlin branching rule for irreducible representations of unitary groups). We find the q-boundary of G, thus extending previously known results (Gorin, Adv. Math., 2012, arXiv:1011.1769).",1
95426,0,"Online Diversion Detection in Nuclear Fuel Cycles via Multimodal Observations In nuclear fuel cycles, an enrichment facility typically provides low enriched uranium (LEU) to a number of customers. We consider monitoring an enrichment facility to timely detect a possible diversion of highly enriched uranium (HEU). To increase the the detection accuracy it is important to efficiently use the available information diversity. In this work, it is assumed that the shipment times and the power consumption of the enrichment facility are observed for each shipment of enriched uranium. We propose to initially learn the statistical patterns of the enrichment facility through the bimodal observations in a training period, that is known to be free of diversions. Then, for the goal of timely diversion detection, we propose to use an online detection algorithm which sequentially compares each set of new observations in the test period, which possibly includes diversions, to the learned patterns, and raises a diversion alarm when a significant statistical deviation is detected. The efficacy of the proposed method is shown by comparing its detection performance to those of the traditional detection methods in the Statistics literature.",1
95452,0,"Resolving Ionisation and Metallicity on Parsec Scales Across Mrk 71 with HST-WFC3 Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) Galaxies in the nearby Universe provide a means for studying feedback mechanisms and star-formation processes in low-metallicity environments in great detail. Due to their vicinity, these local analogues to young galaxies are well suited for high-resolution studies that would be unfeasible for primordial galaxies in the high-redshift universe. Here we present HST-WFC3 observations of one such BCD, Mrk 71, one of the most powerful local starbursts known, in the light of [O II], He II, Hb, [O III], Ha, and [S II]. At D=3.44 Mpc, this extensive suite of emission line images enables us to explore the chemical and physical conditions of Mrk 71 on ~2 pc scales. Using these high spatial-resolution observations, we use emission line diagnostics to distinguish ionisation mechanisms on a pixel-by-pixel basis and show that despite the previously reported hypersonic gas and super-bubble blow out, the gas in Mrk 71 is photoionised, with no sign of shock-excited emission. Using strong-line metallicity diagnostics, we present the first 'metallicity image' of a galaxy, revealing chemically inhomogeneity on scales of &lt;50 pc. We additionally demonstrate that while chemical structure can be lost at large spatial scales, metallicity-diagnostics can break down on spatial scales smaller than a HII region. HeII emission line images are used to identify up to six Wolf-Rayet stars in Mrk 71, three of which lie on the edge of blow-out region. This study not only demonstrates the benefits of high-resolution spatially-resolved observations in assessing the effects of feedback mechanisms, but also the limitations of fine spatial scales when employing emission-line diagnostics. Both aspects are especially relevant as we enter the era of extremely large telescopes, when observing structure on ~10 pc scales will no longer be limited to the local universe.",1

95605,0,"Vertical disc heating in Milky Way-sized galaxies in a cosmological context Vertically extended, high velocity dispersion stellar distributions appear to be a ubiquitous feature of disc galaxies, and both internal and external mechanisms have been proposed to be the major driver of their formation. However, it is unclear to what extent each mechanism can generate such a distribution, which is likely to depend on the assembly history of the galaxy. To this end, we perform 16 high resolution cosmological-zoom simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies using the state-of-the-art cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical code \textlcsc{AREPO}, and analyse the evolution of the vertical kinematics of the stellar disc in connection with various heating mechanisms. We find that the bar is the dominant heating mechanism in most cases, whereas spiral arms, radial migration, and adiabatic heating from mid-plane density growth are all sub-dominant. The strongest source, though less prevalent than bars, originates from external perturbations from satellites/sub-halos of masses log$_{10} (M/\rm M_{\odot}) \gtrsim 10$. However, in many simulations the orbits of newborn star particles become cooler with time, such that they dominate the shape of the age-velocity dispersion relation and overall vertical disc structure unless a strong external perturbation takes place.",1

This model is proved to be exactly solvable, and is shown to exhibit a Kondo effect, i.e. that, if the interaction between the impurity and the electrons is antiferromagnetic, then the magnetic susceptibility of the impurity is finite in the 0-temperature limit, whereas it diverges if the interaction is ferromagnetic. Such an effect is therefore inherently non-perturbative. This difficulty is overcome by using the exact solvability of the model, which follows both from its fermionic and hierarchical nature.",1

Based on the hydrodynamic equations and thermodynamic relations, we derive exact expressions for energy conservation suitable to be solved in simulation. We also show that some formulae commonly used in the literature are obtained as approximations of the exact expressions. We simulate the evolution of very massive stars of ~100-320 Msun with zero- and 1/10 Zsun, and calculate further explosions as PISNe, applying each of the exact and approximate formulae. The calculations demonstrate that the explosion properties of PISN, such as the mass range, the 56Ni yield, and the explosion energy, are significantly affected by applying the different energy generation rates. We discuss how these results affect the estimate of the PISN detection rate, which depends on the theoretical predictions of such explosion properties.",1

96020,0,"Upper critical field and (non)-superconductivity of magnetars We construct equilibrium models of compact stars using a realistic equation of state and obtain the density range occupied by the proton superconductor in strong $B$-fields. We do so by combining the density profiles of our models with microscopic calculations of proton pairing gaps and the critical unpairing field $H_{c2}$ above which the proton type-II superconductivity is destroyed. We find that magnetars with interior homogeneous field within the range $0.1 \le B_{16}\le 2$, where $B_{16} = B/10^{16}$ G, are partially superconducting, whereas those with $B_{16} &gt; 2$ are void of superconductivity.

96046,0,"Calibrating conservative and dissipative response of electrically-driven quartz tuning forks Determining sensor parameters is a prerequisite for quantitative force measurement. Here we report a direct, high-precision calibration method for quartz tuning fork(TF) sensors that are popular in the feld of nanomechanical measurement. In the method, conservative and dissipative forces with controlled amplitudes are applied to one prong of TF directly to mimic the tip-sample interaction, and the responses of the sensor are measured at the same time to extract sensor parameters. The method, for the frst time, allows force gradient and damping coeffcient which correspond to the conservative and dissipative interactions to be measured simultaneously. The calibration result shows surprisingly that, unlike cantilevers, the frequency shift for TFs depends on both the conservative and dissipative forces, which may be ascribed to the complex dynamics. The effectiveness of the method is testifed by force spectrum measurement with a calibrated TF. The method is generic for all kinds of sensors used for non-contact atomic force microscopy(NC-AFM) and is an important improvement for quantitative nanomechanical measurement.",1

A hot halo (10^6.3 K) is detected around the Milky Way through the O VII and O VIII resonance absorption and emission lines in the soft X-ray band. Current instruments are not sensitive enough to detect this gas in absorption around other galaxies and galaxy groups, the two most likely sites. We show that resonant line absorption by this hot gas can be detected with current technology, with a collecting area exceeding about 300 cm^2 and a resolution R &gt; 2000. For a few notional X-ray telescope configurations that could be constructed as Explorer or Probe missions, we calculate the differential number of O VII and O VIII absorbers as a function of equivalent width through redshift space, dN/dz.

The existing record of accidents with some simplifying assumptions regarding their probability distribution is sufficient to rule out the validity of the industry's analyses at a very high confidence level. We show that this conclusion is robust against any reasonable assumed variation of safety standards over time, and across regions. The debate on nuclear liability indicates that the industry has independently arrived at this conclusion. We pay special attention to the Indian situation, where we show that the existing operating experience provides insufficient data to make any reliable claims about the safety of future reactors.

In this construction, the movement of one particle is controlled by the presence or absence of other particles, an effective quantum field effect transistor that allows the construction of controlled-NOT and controlled-rotation gates. The construction translates into a model for universal quantum computation with time-independent 2-qubit ZZ and XX+YY interactions on an (almost) planar grid. The effective Hamiltonian is arrived at by a single use of first-order perturbation theory avoiding the use of perturbation gadgets. The dynamics and spectral properties of the effective Hamiltonian can be fully determined as it corresponds to a particular realization of a mapping between a quantum circuit and a Hamiltonian called the space-time circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction. Because of the simple interactions required, and because no higher-order perturbation gadgets are employed, our construction is potentially realizable using superconducting or other solid-state qubits.",1

The galaxy SMF is well represented by a single Schechter function (M* = 11.116+/-0.011, alpha = -1.145+/-0.008), though with a hint of a steeper faint end slope. The corresponding stellar mass densities are (2.670+/-0.110), (1.687+/-0.063) and (0.910+/-0.029)x10^8 M_solar Mpc^-3 for galaxies, spheroids and disks respectively. We identify a crossover stellar mass of log(M/M_solar) = 10.3+/-0.030 at which the spheroid and disk SMFs are equal. Relative contributions of four distinct spheroid/disk dominated sub-populations to the overall galaxy SMF are also presented. The mean disk-to-spheroid stellar mass ratio shows a five fold disk dominance at the low mass end, decreasing monotonically with a corresponding increase in the spheroidal fraction till the two are equal at a galaxy stellar mass, log(M/M_solar)=10.479+/-0.013, the dominance of spheroids then grows with increasing stellar mass. The relative numbers of composite disk and spheroid dominated galaxies show peaks in their distributions, perhaps indicative of a preferred galaxy mass.

We describe the design in detail and then characterize the working trap using a single trapped 171 Yb ion. Excess micromotion has been eliminated to the resolution of the detection method and the trap exhibits an anomalous phonon heating rate of d /dt = 24 +30/-24 per second. The thermal properties of the trap structure have also been measured with an effective temperature rise at the ion's position of 0.14 +/- 0.14 K. The small perturbations to the ion caused by this trap make it suitable to be used for an optical frequency standard with fractional uncertainties below the 10^-18 level.,1
96588,0,"The formation of Cataclysmic Variables: the influence of nova eruptions The theoretical and observed populations of pre-cataclysmic variables (pre-CVs) are dominated by systems with low-mass white dwarfs (WDs), while the WD masses in CVs are typically high. In addition, the space density of CVs is found to be significantly lower than theoretical models. We investigate the influence of nova outbursts on the formation and (initial) evolution of CVs. In particular, we calculate the stability of the mass transfer in case all the material accreted on the WD is lost in classical novae, and part of the energy to eject the material comes from a common-envelope like interaction with the companion. In addition, we study the effect of an asymmetry in the mass ejection, that may lead to small eccentricities in the orbit. We find that a common-envelope like ejection significantly decreases the stability of the mass transfer, in particular for low-mass WD. Similarly, the influence of asymmetric mass loss can be important for short-period systems and even more so for low-mass WD, but likely disappears long before the next nova outburst due to orbital circularization. In both cases the mass-transfer rates increase, which may lead to observable (and perhaps already observed) consequences for systems that do survive to become CVs. However, a more detailed investigation of the interaction between nova ejecta and the companion and the evolution of slightly eccentric CVs is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.",1
96639,0,"Inverse problem in Ionospheric Science: Prediction of solar soft-X-ray spectrum from Very Low Frequency Radiosonde results X-rays and gamma-rays from astronomical sources such as solar flares are mostly absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Resulting electron-ion production rate as a function of height depends on the intensity and wavelength of the injected spectrum and therefore the effects vary from one source to another. In other words, the ion density vs. altitude profile has the imprint of the incident photon spectrum. In this paper, we investigate whether we can invert the problem uniquely by deconvolution of the VLF amplitude signal to obtain the details of the injected spectrum. We find that it is possible to do this up to a certain accuracy. Our method is useful to carry out a similar exercise to infer the spectra of more energetic events such as the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), Soft Gamma Ray Repeaters (SGRs) etc. by probing even the lower part of the atmosphere. We thus show that to certain extent, the Earth's atmosphere could be used as a gigantic detector of relatively strong events.",1
96693,0,"Quantum oscillations from generic surface Fermi arcs and bulk chiral modes in Weyl semimetals We re-examine the question of quantum oscillations from surface Fermi arcs and chiral modes in Weyl semimetals. By introducing two tools - semiclassical phase-space quantization and a numerical implementation of a layered construction of Weyl semimetals - we discover several important generalizations to previous conclusions that were implicitly tailored to the special case of identical Fermi arcs on top and bottom surfaces. We show that the phase-space quantization picture fixes an ambiguity in the previously utilized energy-time quantization approach and correctly reproduces the numerically calculated quantum oscillations for generic Weyl semimetals with distinctly curved Fermi arcs on the two surfaces. Based on these methods, we identify a 'magic' magnetic-field angle where quantum oscillations become independent of sample thickness, with striking experimental implications. We also analyze the stability of these quantum oscillations to disorder, and show that the high-field oscillations are expected to persist in samples whose thickness parametrically exceeds the quantum mean free path.",1

The work makes use of the most up-to-date data from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and the Taiwan ECDFS Near-Infrared Survey (TENIS) in addition to other data. We also revisit multi-wavelength counterparts for published X-ray sources from the 4Ms-CDFS and 250ks-ECDFS surveys, finding reliable counterparts for 1207 out of 1259 sources ($\sim 96\%$). Data used for photometric redshifts include intermediate-band photometry deblended using the TFIT method, which is used for the first time in this work. Photometric redshifts for X-ray source counterparts are based on a new library of AGN/galaxy hybrid templates appropriate for the faint X-ray population in the CDFS. Photometric redshift accuracy for normal galaxies is 0.010 and for X-ray sources is 0.014, and outlier fractions are $4\%$ and $5.4\%$ respectively. The results within the CANDELS coverage area are even better as demonstrated both by spectroscopic comparison and by galaxy-pair statistics. Intermediate-band photometry, even if shallow, is valuable when combined with deep broad-band photometry. For best accuracy, templates must include emission lines.",1
96829,0,"Exact results for model wave functions of anisotropic composite fermions in the fractional quantum Hall effect The microscopic wave functions of the composite fermion theory can incorporate electron mass anisotropy by a trivial rescaling of the coordinates. These wave functions are very likely adiabatically connected to the actual wave functions of the anisotropic fractional quantum Hall states. We show in this article that they possess the nice property that their energies can be analytically related to the previously calculated energies for the isotropic states through a universal scale factor, thus allowing an estimation of several observables in the thermodynamic limit for all fractional quantum Hall states. The rather weak dependence of the scale factor on the anisotropy provides insight into why fractional quantum Hall effect and composite fermions are quite robust to electron mass anisotropy. We discuss how better, though still approximate, wave functions can be obtained by introducing a variational parameter, following Haldane [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 107}, 116801 (2011)], but the resulting wave functions are not readily amenable to calculations. Our considerations are also applicable, with minimal modification, to the case where the dielectric function of the background material is anisotropic.",1

We prove that in such an expanding space-time, the geodesics are curved and more precisely, they fluctuate on the boundaries of the expanding basic elements. The non existence of privileged expansion direction leads to the existence of an infinity of fluctuating geodesics between any two locations in this space-time, that provides a prediction of polarization in geometric optics, and a prediction of an earlier acceleration of the expansion as for the cosmic inflation model. This simulation is a case study and an example of space-time with variable topology using the principle of variation of topology via a transformation that creates holes.",1
96867,0,"Mid-infrared luminous quasars in the GOODS-Herschel fields: a large population of heavily-obscured, Compton-thick quasars at z~2 We present the infrared (IR) and X-ray properties of a sample of 33 mid-IR luminous quasars ($\nu$L(6 micron)&gt;6x10$^{44}$ erg/s) at redshift z~1-3, identified through detailed spectral energy distribution analyses of distant star-forming galaxies, using the deepest IR data from Spitzer and Herschel in the GOODS-Herschel fields. The aim is to constrain the fraction of obscured, and Compton-thick (CT, N$_H$&gt;1.5x10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) quasars at the peak era of nuclear and star-formation activities. Despite being very bright in the mid-IR band, ~30% of these quasars are not detected in the extremely deep 2 Ms and 4 Ms Chandra X-ray data available in these fields. X-ray spectral analysis of the detected sources reveals that the majority (~67%) are obscured by column densities N$_H$&gt;10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$; this fraction reaches ~80% when including the X-ray undetected sources (9 out of 33), which are likely to be the most heavily-obscured, CT quasars. We constrain the fraction of CT quasars in our sample to be ~24-48%, and their space density to be $\Phi$=(6.7$\pm$2.2)x10$^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. From the investigation of the quasar host galaxies in terms of star-formation rates (SFRs) and morphological distortions, as a sign of galaxy mergers/interactions, we do not find any direct relation between SFRs and quasar luminosity or X-ray obscuration. On the other hand, there is tentative evidence that the most heavily-obscured quasars have, on average, more disturbed morphologies than the unobscured/moderately-obscured quasar hosts, which preferentially live in undisturbed systems. However, the fraction of quasars with disturbed morphology amongst the whole sample is ~40%, suggesting that galaxy mergers are not the main fuelling mechanism of quasars at z~2.",1

97117,0,"The Mechanisms of Electron Acceleration During Multiple X Line Magnetic Reconnection with a Guide Field The interactions between magnetic islands are considered to play an important role in electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection. In this paper, two-dimensional (2-D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed to study electron acceleration during multiple X line reconnection with a guide field. The electrons remain almost magnetized, and we can then analyze the contributions of the parallel electric field, Fermi and betatron mechanisms to electron acceleration during the evolution of magnetic reconnection by comparing with a guide-center theory. The results show that with the proceeding of magnetic reconnection, two magnetic islands are formed in the simulation domain. The electrons are accelerated by both the parallel electric field in the vicinity of the X lines and Fermi mechanism due to the contraction of the two magnetic islands. Then the two magnetic islands begin to merge into one, and in such a process electrons can be accelerated by the parallel electric field and betatron mechanisms. During the betatron acceleration, the electrons are locally accelerated in the regions where the magnetic field is piled up by the high-speed flow from the X line. At last, when the coalescence of the two islands into a big one finishes, electrons can further be accelerated by the Fermi mechanism because of the contraction of the big island. With the increase of the guide field, the contributions of Fermi and betatron mechanisms to electron acceleration become less and less important. When the guide field is sufficiently large, the contributions of Fermi and betatron mechanisms are almost negligible.",1
97148,0,"Super-Eddington growth of the first black holes The assembly of the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) at $z \gtrsim 6$ is still a subject of intense debate. If black holes (BHs) grow at their Eddington rate, they must start from $\gtrsim 10^4 \, M_\odot$ seeds formed by the direct collapse of gas. Here we explore the alternative scenario where $\sim 100 \, M_\odot$ BH remnants of the first stars grow at super-Eddington rate via radiatively inefficient slim accretion disks. We use an improved version of the cosmological, data-constrained semi-analytic model GAMETE/QSOdust, where we follow the evolution of nuclear BHs and gas cooling, disk and bulge formation of their host galaxies. Adopting SDSS J1148+5251 (J1148) at $z = 6.4$ as a prototype of luminous $z \gtrsim 6$ quasars, we find that $\sim$ 80% of its SMBH mass is grown by super-Eddington accretion, which can be sustained down to $z \sim 10$ in dense, gas-rich environments. The average BH mass at $z \sim 20$ is $M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^4 \,M_\odot$, comparable to that of direct collapse BHs. At $z = 6.4$ the AGN-driven mass outflow rate is consistent with the observations and the BH-to-bulge mass ratio is compatible with the local scaling relation. However, the stellar mass in the central 2.5 kpc is closer to the value inferred from CO observations. Finally, $\sim 20 %$ of J1148 progenitors at $z=7.1$ have BH luminosities and masses comparable to ULAS J1120+0641, suggesting that this quasar may be one of the progenitors of J1148.",1
97167,0,"Suppression of Star Formation in the Hosts of Low-Excitation Radio Galaxies The feedback from radio-loud active galactic nuclei (R-AGN) may help maintain low star formation (SF) rates in their early-type hosts, but the observational evidence for this mechanism has been inconclusive. We study systematic differences of aggregate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of various subsets of $\sim$4000 low-redshift R-AGN from Best &amp; Heckman (2012) with respect to (currently) inactive control samples selected to have matching redshift, stellar mass, population age, axis ratio, and environment. Aggregate SEDs, ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) through mid-infrared (mid-IR, 22 $\mu$m), were constructed using a Bayesian method that eliminates biases from non-detections in GALEX and WISE. We study rare high-excitation sources separately from low-excitation ones, which we split by environment and host properties. We find that both the UV and mid-IR emission of non-cluster R-AGNs (80% of sample) are suppressed by $\sim$0.2 dex relative to that of the control group, especially for moderately massive galaxies (log $M_* \lesssim$ 11). The difference disappears for high-mass R-AGN and for R-AGN in clusters, where other, non-AGN quenching/maintenance mechanisms may dominate, or where the suppression of SF due to AGN may persist between active phases of the central engine, perhaps because of the presence of a hot gaseous halo storing AGN energy. High-excitation (high accretion rate) sources, which make up 2% of the R-AGN sample, also show no evidence of SF suppression (their UV is the same as in controls), but they exhibit a strong mid-IR excess due to AGN dust heating.",1

Furthermore our formulae provide easier calculation rather than conventional treatments, so we think that they suits to application to physics.

97773,0,"Study of Temporal Evolution of Emission Spectrum in a Steeply Rising Submillimeter Burst In the paper the spectral temporal evolution of a steeply rising submillimeter (THz) burst occurred on 2003 November 2 was investigated in detail for the first time. Observations show that the flux density of the THz spectrum increased steeply with frequency above 200 GHz. Their average rising rates reached a value of 235 sfu/GHz (corresponding spectral index $\alpha$ of 4.8) during the burst. The flux densities reached about 4,000 and 70,000 sfu at 212 and 405 GHz at maximum phase, respectively. The emissions at 405 GHz maintained continuous high level that they exceed largely the peak values of the microwave (MW) spectra during the main phase. Our studies suggest that only energetic electrons with a low-energy cutoff of $\sim$1 MeV and number density of $\sim$$10^{6}$--$10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$ can produce such strong and steeply rising THz component via gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation based on numerical simulations of burst spectra in the nonuniform magnetic field case. The electron number density $N$, derived from our numerical fits to the THz temporal evolution spectra, increased substantially from $8\times10^{6}$ to $4\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$, i.e., $N$ value increased 50 times during the rise phase. During the decay phase it decreased to $7\times10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$, i.e., decreased about five times from the maximum phase. The total electron number decreased an order of magnitude from the maximum phase to the decay phase. Nevertheless the variation amplitude of $N$ is only about one time in the MW emission source during this burst, and the total electron number did not decrease but increased by about 20$\%$ during the decay phase. Interestingly, we find that the THz source radius decreased by about 24$\%$ while the MW source one, on the contrary, increased by 28$\%$ during the decay phase.",1
97782,0,"Extremely Isolated Galaxies I. Sample and Simulation Analysis We have selected a sample of extremely isolated galaxies (EIGs) from the local Universe ($\mbox{z} &lt; 0.024$), using a simple isolation criterion: having no known neighbours closer than $300\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ ($3\,h^{-1}\,\mbox{Mpc}$) in the three-dimensional redshift space $(\alpha,\delta,\mbox{z})$. The sample is unique both in its level of isolation and in the fact that it utilizes HI redshifts from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey (ALFALFA). We analysed the EIG sample using cosmological simulations and found that it contains extremely isolated galaxies with normal mass haloes which have evolved gradually with little or no ""major events"" (major mergers, or major mass-loss events) in the last $3\,\mbox{Gyr}$. The fraction of EIGs which deviate from this definition (false positives) is 5%-10%. For the general population of dark matter haloes it was further found that the mass accretion (relative to the current halo mass) is affected by the halo environment mainly through strong interactions with its neighbours.

Here, we employ a high-resolution hybrid particle-in-cell simulation in order to investigate the relation between spatial properties of the proton temperature and the peaks in the current density and in the flow vorticity. Our results indicate that, although regions where the proton temperature is enhanced and temperature anisotropies are larger correspond approximately to regions where many thin current sheets form, no firm quantitative evidence supports the idea of a direct causality between the two phenomena. On the other hand, quite a clear correlation between the behavior of the proton temperature and the out-of-plane vorticity is obtained.",1

Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we study the crossover between the counting of discrete particles and of the continuous particle density as a function of smoothing in the counting procedure. In the discrete-particle limit, the result is given by the Fisher--Hartwig expansion for Toeplitz determinants, while in the continuous limit we recover the bosonization results. This example of full counting statistics with smoothing is also related to orthogonality catastrophe, Fermi-edge singularity and non-equilibrium bosonization.",1

We use K-means -a simple yet powerful unsupervised clustering algorithm which picks out structure in unlabeled data- to study a sample of quasar UV spectra from the Quasar Catalog of the 10th Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of Paris et al. (2014). Detecting patterns in large datasets helps us gain insights into the physical conditions and processes giving rise to the observed properties of quasars. We use K-means to find clusters in the parameter space of the equivalent width (EW), the blue- and red-half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the Mg II 2800 A line, the C IV 1549 A line, and the C III] 1908 A blend in samples of Broad Absorption-Line (BAL) and non-BAL quasars at redshift 1.6-2.1. Using this method, we successfully recover correlations well-known in the UV regime such as the anti-correlation between the EW and blueshift of the C IV emission line and the shape of the ionizing Spectra Energy distribution (SED) probed by the strength of He II and the Si III]/C III] ratio. We find this to be particularly evident when the properties of C III] are used to find the clusters, while those of Mg II proved to be less strongly correlated with the properties of the other lines in the spectra such as the width of C IV or the Si III]/C III] ratio.

Accordingly, acceleration values read by these sensors must be corrected for the gravitational component.

98721,0,"Coherent Diffractive Imaging Using Randomly Coded Masks Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) provides new opportunities for high resolution X-ray imaging with simultaneous amplitude and phase contrast. Extensions to CDI broaden the scope of the technique for use in a wide variety of experimental geometries and physical systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new extension to CDI that encodes additional information through the use of a series of randomly coded masks. The information gained from the few additional diffraction measurements removes the need for typical object-domain constraints; the algorithm uses prior information about the masks instead. The experiment is performed using a laser diode at 532.2 nm, enabling rapid prototyping for future X-ray synchrotron and even free electron laser experiments. Diffraction patterns are collected with up to 15 different masks placed between a CCD detector and a single sample. Phase retrieval is performed using a convex relaxation routine known as ""PhaseCut"" followed by a variation on Fienup's input-output algorithm. The reconstruction quality is judged via calculation of phase retrieval transfer functions as well as by an object-space comparison between reconstructions and a lens-based image of the sample. The results of this analysis indicate that with enough masks (in this case 3 or 4) the diffraction phases converge reliably, implying stability and uniqueness of the retrieved solution.",1

99358,0,"Exploiting plume structure to decode gas source distance using metal-oxide gas sensors Estimating the distance of a gas source is important in many applications of chemical sensing, like e.g. environmental monitoring, or chemically-guided robot navigation. If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is available, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas concentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where fast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are required to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that can be exploited for distance estimation in a turbulent environment lies in the relationship between source proximity and the temporal variance of the local gas concentration - the farther the source, the more intermittent are gas encounters. However, exploiting this feature requires measurement of changes in gas concentration on a comparably fast time scale, that have up to now only been achieved using photo-ionisation detectors. Here, we demonstrate that by appropriate signal processing, off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors are capable of extracting rapidly fluctuating features of gas plumes that strongly correlate with source distance. We show that with a straightforward analysis method it is possible to decode events of large, consistent changes in the measured signal, so-called 'bouts'. The frequency of these bouts predicts the distance of a gas source in wind-tunnel experiments with good accuracy. In addition, we found that the variance of bout counts indicates cross-wind offset to the centreline of the gas plume. Our results offer an alternative approach to estimating gas source proximity that is largely independent of gas concentration, using off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors. The analysis method we employ demands very few computational resources and is suitable for low-power microcontrollers.",1

99411,0,"One possible explanation for the Balmer and Lyman line shifts in quasars Internal line shifts in quasars spectra have played a more prominent role in our understanding of quasar structure and dynamics. The observed different redshift among broad hydrogen lines is still an amazing puzzle in the study of quasars. We have argued that the broad hydrogen lines, as well as the low-ionization lines in quasars, are significantly contributed by the Cerenkov quasi-line emission of the fast electrons in the dense clouds/filaments/sheets ($N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{14}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$); whereas this line-like radiation mechanism is invalid for producing the high ionization lines. In order to account for redshift difference, the Cerenkov line-like radiation mechanism could provide a plausible resolution: it is the `Cerenkov line redshift', which is different from line to line, causes the peculiar redshift-differences among Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. The different redshifts among different broad hydrogen lines could stand for an evidence to quantitatively support that the observed broad hydrogen lines should be blended by both the real line emission and the Cerenkov quasi-line emission. The good fitting to the observed redshifts of quasars confirms the existence of Cerenkov component in the broad hydrogen lines, which indicates that, in the blended Ly$\alpha$ line, the line-intensity of the Cerenkov component approximately equals that of the accompanying `normal line' (an approximate equipartition of intensity between the two components in the broad Ly$\alpha$ line). This result illustrates the importance of the Cerenkov component in the broad lines of quasars, which can be further confirmed by future observations.",1

X-rays interact with the dust and gas present in such environments. While a few laboratory X-ray irradiation experiments have been performed on ices, X-ray irradiation experiments on bare cosmic dust analogs have been scarce up to now. Our goal is to study the effects of hard X-rays on cosmic dust analogs via in-situ X-ray diffraction. By using a hard X-ray synchrotron nanobeam, we seek to simulate cumulative X-ray exposure on dust grains during their lifetime in these astrophysical environments, and provide an upper limit on the effect of hard X-rays on dust grain structure. We prepared enstatite nanograins, analogs to cosmic silicates, via the melting-quenching technique. These amorphous grains were then annealed to obtain polycrystalline grains. These were characterized via scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy before irradiation. Powder samples were prepared in X-ray transparent substrates and were irradiated with hard X-rays nanobeams (29.4 keV) provided by beamline ID16B of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. X-ray diffraction images were recorded in transmission mode. We detected the amorphization of polycrystalline silicates embedded in an organic matrix after an accumulated X-ray exposure of 6.4 x 10$^{27}$ eV cm$^{-2}$. Pure crystalline silicate grains (without resin) did not exhibit amorphization. None of the amorphous silicate samples (pure and embedded in resin) underwent crystallization. We analyzed the evolution of the polycrystalline sample embedded in an organic matrix as a function of X-ray exposure. Loss of diffraction peak intensity, peak broadening, and the disappearance of discrete spots and arcs, revealed the amorphization of the resin embedded (originally polycrystalline) silicate sample.",1

99891,0,"Classifications and canonical forms of tensor product expressions in the presence of permutation symmetries Complicated mathematical equations involving tensors with permutation symmetries are frequently encountered in fields such as quantum chemistry, e.g., those in coupled cluster theories and derivatives of wavefunction parameters. In automatic derivations of these equations, a key step is the collection of product terms that can be found identical by using permutation symmetries or relabelling dummy indices. In the present work, we define a canonical form for a general tensor product in the presence of permutation symmetries as a result of the classification of all tensor products from a group theoretical point of view. To make such definition of practical use, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the canonical form by combining the classical backtrack search for permutation groups and the idea of partitions used in graph isomorphism algorithms. The resulted algorithm can compute canonical forms and generators of the automorphism groups of tensor expressions. Moreover, for tensor products with external indices, its permutation group can be determined via the quotient group of the automorphism group for the corresponding externally and internally unlabeled graph (skeleton) with respect to that for the externally labeled and internally unlabeled graph (diagram).",1

These three transformations yield a mass-dependent rigid orthogonal tetrahedron of constant volume in the inertial coordinates. Each of those three linear transformations is a function of three coordinates that produce the nine degrees of freedom of the Four-Body problem, in a coordinate system with the center of mass as origin. The relation between the well known equilateral tetrahedron solution of the gravitational Four-Body problem and the new coordinates is exhibited, and the plane case of central configurations with four different masses is computed numerically in these coordinates.",1

We present the results of simulations that reconstruct the orbit trajectories and disturbed morphologies of pairs of interacting galaxies.

FFPs are simple, inexpensive, monolithic units that can yield a stable and repeatable output spectrum. An FFP is a unique alternative to a traditional etalon, as the interferometric cavity is made of single-mode fiber rather than an air-gap spacer. This design allows for excellent collimation, high spectral finesse, rigid mechanical stability, insensitivity to vibrations, and no need for vacuum operation. The device we have tested is a commercially available product from Micron Optics. Our development path is targeted towards a calibration source for the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF), a near-infrared spectrograph designed to detect terrestrial-mass planets around low-mass stars, but this reference could also be used in many existing and planned fiber-fed spectrographs as we illustrate using the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) instrument. With precise temperature control of the fiber etalon, we achieve a thermal stability of 100 $\mu$K and associated velocity uncertainty of 22 cm s$^{-1}$. We achieve a precision of $\approx$2 m s$^{-1}$ in a single APOGEE fiber over 12 hours using this new photonic reference after removal of systematic correlations. This high precision (close to the expected photon-limited floor) is a testament to both the excellent intrinsic wavelength stability of the fiber interferometer and the stability of the APOGEE instrument design. Overall instrument velocity precision is 80 cm s$^{-1}$ over 12 hours when averaged over all 300 APOGEE fibers and after removal of known trends and pressure correlations, implying the fiber etalon is intrinsically stable to significantly higher precision.",1

100626,0,"ALMACAL I: First dual-band number counts from a deep and wide ALMA submm survey, free from cosmic variance We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide and deep submm survey, ALMACAL. These calibration data comprise a large number of observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array configurations. Gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many ALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the detection of faint dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant area. In this paper we outline our survey strategy and report the first results. We have analysed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of $\sim 25 \, {\rm \mu Jy \, beam^{-1}}$ at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative approach based on $\geq 5 \sigma$ detections, we have found eight and 11 DSFGs in ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities $S_{\rm 1.2 mm} \geq 0.2 \, {\rm mJy}$. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the deepest \emph{Herschel} surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been determined independently at 870 $\mu$m and 1.2 mm, from a sparse sampling of the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least $2\times$. Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs, with redshifts determined via detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then allows morphological studies of very faint DSFGs - representative of more normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies (SMGs) - in fields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial resolution.",1

In strongly-correlated cerium monopnictides, we find two sets of highly anisotropic Dirac fermions that interpenetrate each other with negligible hybridization, and show a peculiar four-fold degeneracy where their Dirac nodes overlap. Despite the lack of protection by crystalline or time-reversal symmetries, this four-fold degeneracy is robust across magnetic phase transitions. Comparison of these experimental findings with our theoretical calculations suggests that the observed surface Dirac fermions arise from bulk band inversions at an odd number of high-symmetry points, which is analogous to the band topology which describes a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-topological phase. Our findings open up an unprecedented and long-sought-for platform for exploring novel Dirac fermion physics in a strongly-correlated semimetal.",1

100941,0,Fractional quantum Hall states with negative flux: edge modes in some Abelian and non-Abelian cases We investigate the structure of gapless edge modes propagating at the boundary of some fractional quantum Hall states. We show how to deduce explicit trial wavefunctions from the knowledge of the effective theory governing the edge modes. In general quantum Hall states have many edge states. Here we discuss the case of fractions having only two such modes. The case of spin-polarized and spin-singlet states at filling fraction 2/5 is considered. We give an explicit description of the decoupled charged and neutral modes. Then we discuss the situation involving negative flux acting on the composite fermions. This happens notably for the filling factor 2/3 which supports two counterpropagating modes. Microscopic wavefunctions for spin-polarized and spin-singlet states at this filling factor are given. Finally we present an analysis of the edge structure of a non-Abelian state involving also negative flux. Counterpropagating modes involve in all cases explicit derivative operators diminishing the angular momentum of the system.,1

101092,0,"Lorentz-invariant three-vectors and alternative formulation of relativistic dynamics Besides the well known scalar invariants, there exist also vectorial invariants in the realm of special relativity. It is shown that the three-vector $\left(\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\right)_{\parallel v}+\gamma_v\left(\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\right)_{\perp v}$ is invariant under the Lorentz transformation. The indices $_{\parallel v}$ and $_{\perp v}$ denote the respective components established with respect to the direction of the velocity of body $\vec{v}$, and $\vec{p}$ is the relativistic momentum. We prove that this vector is equal to a force of $\vec{F}_R$ satisfying the classical Newtonian law $\vec{F}_R=m\vec{a}_R$ in the instantaneous inertial rest frame of an accelerated body. Therefore the equation $\vec{F}_R=\left(\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\right)_{\parallel v}+\gamma_v\left(\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\right)_{\perp v}$, based on the Lorentz-invariant vectors, may be used as a truly invariant (not merely a covariant) relativistic equation of motion in any inertial system of reference. An alternative approach to classical electrodynamics based on the invariant three-vectors is proposed.",1
101110,0,"Aluminium-oxide wires for superconducting high kinetic inductance circuits We investigate thin films of conducting aluminium-oxide, also known as granular aluminium, as a material for superconducting high quality, high kinetic inductance circuits. The films are deposited by an optimised reactive DC magnetron sputter process and characterised using microwave measurement techniques at milli-Kelvin temperatures. We show that, by precise control of the reactive sputter conditions, a high room temperature sheet resistance and therefore high kinetic inductance at low temperatures can be obtained. For a coplanar waveguide resonator with 1.5\,k$\Omega$ sheet resistance and a kinetic inductance fraction close to unity, we measure a quality factor in the order of 700\,000 at 20\,mK. Furthermore, we observe a sheet resistance reduction by gentle heat treatment in air. This behaviour is exploited to study the kinetic inductance change using the microwave response of a coplanar wave guide resonator. We find the correlation between the kinetic inductance and the sheet resistance to be in good agreement with theoretical expectations.",1
101148,0,"Coronagraphic demonstration experiment using aluminum mirrors for space infrared astronomical observations For future space infrared astronomical coronagraphy, we perform experimental studies on the application of aluminum mirrors to a coronagraph. Cooled reflective optics is required for broad-band mid-infrared observations in space, while high-precision optics is required for coronagraphy. For the coronagraph instrument originally proposed for the next-generation infrared astronomical satellite project SPICA (SCI: SPICA Coronagraph Instrument), we fabricated and evaluated the optics consisting of high-precision aluminum off-axis mirrors with diamond-turned surfaces, and conducted a coronagraphic demonstration experiment using the optics with a coronagraph mask. We first measured the wave front errors (WFEs) of the aluminum mirrors with a He-Ne Fizeau interferometer to confirm that the power spectral densities of the WFEs satisfy the SCI requirements. Then we integrated the mirrors into an optical system and evaluated the overall performance of the system. As a result, we estimate the total WFE of the optics to be 33 nm (rms), each mirror contributing 10-20 nm (rms) for the central 14 mm area of the optics, and obtain a contrast of 10^(-5.4) as a coronagraph in the visible light. At a wavelength of 5 um, the coronagraphic system is expected to achieve a contrast of ~10^(-7) based on our model calculation with the measured optical performance. Thus our experiment demonstrates that aluminum mirror optics is applicable to a highly WFE-sensitive instrument such as a coronagraph in space.",1

The spatial case If one has to attain high accuracy over long timescales during the numerical computation of the N-body problem, the method called Lie-integration is one of the most effective algorithms. In this paper we present a set of recurrence relations with which the coefficients needed by the Lie-integration of the orbital elements related to the spatial N-body problem can be derived up to arbitrary order. Similarly to the planar case, these formulae yields identically zero series in the case of no perturbations. In addition, the derivation of the formulae has two stages, analogously to the planar problem. Namely, the formulae are obtained to the first order, and then, higher order relations are expanded by involving directly the multilinear and fractional properties of the Lie-operator.",1

We use XMM-Newton to obtain X-ray spectra using the EPIC-pn camera, and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to obtain UV spectra. Our observations are simultaneous and span timescales of days to years. We find that the soft X-ray obscuration that absorbed the low energy continuum of NGC 985 in August 2013 diminished greatly by January 2015. The total X-ray column density decreased from 2.1 x 10^22 cm^-2 to ~6 x 10^21 cm^-2. We also detect broad, fast UV absorption lines in COS spectra obtained during the 2013 obscuration event. Lines of C III*, Ly alpha, Si IV and C IV with outflow velocities of -5970 km/s and a full-width at half-maximum of 1420 km/s are prominent in the 2013 spectrum, but have disappeared in all but Ly alpha in the 2015 spectra. The ionization state and the column density of the UV absorbing gas is compatible with arising in the same gas as that causing the X-ray obscuration. The high velocity of the UV-absorbing gas suggests that the X-ray obscurer and the associated UV outflow are manifestations of an accretion disk wind.",1
101415,0,"Spurious shear induced by the tree rings of the LSST CCDs We present an analysis of the impact of the tree rings seen in the candidate sensors of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) on galaxy-shape measurements. The tree rings are a consequence of transverse electric fields caused by circularly symmetric impurity gradients in the silicon of the sensors. They effectively modify the pixel area and shift the photogenerated charge around, displacing the observed photon positions. The displacement distribution generates distortions that cause spurious shears correlated with the tree-rings patterns, potentially biasing cosmic shear measurements. In this paper we quantify the amplitude of the spurious shear caused by the tree rings on the LSST candidate sensors, and calculate its 2-point correlation function. We find that 2-point correlation function of the spurious shear on an area equivalent to the LSST field of view is order of about $10^{-13}$, providing a negligible contribution to the 2-point correlation of the cosmic shear signal. Additional work is underway, and the final results and analysis will be published elsewhere (Okura et al. (2015), in prep.)",1

We consider the general conditions on the collision kernel from Dudy\'nski and Ekiel-Je\'zewska (Commun Math Phys \textbf{115}(4):607--629, 1985). Additionally, we prove sharp constructive upper and coercive lower bounds for the linearized relativistic Boltzmann collision operator in terms of a geometric fractional Sobolev norm; this shows that a spectral gap exists and that this behavior is similar to that of the non-relativistic case as shown by Gressman and Strain (Journal of AMS \textbf{24}(3), 771--847, 2011). Lastly, we derive the relativistic analogue of Carleman dual representation of Boltzmann collision operator.

The recent experimental implementation of optical lattices with highly tunable geometry in cold gases opens up a new thrust on exploring these novel quantum states. Here we report that the topological non-trivial Bloch bands can arise naturally in a noncentrosymmetric lattice. It induces a controllable orbital hybridization, producing the topological band structure. In such bands, when considering attractive fermionic atoms, we find a topological Fulde-Ferrell superfluid state with finite center-of-mass momentum in the presence of onsite rotation. This topological superfluid supports Majorana fermions on its edges. Experimental signatures are predicted for cold gases in radio-frequency spectroscopy.",1

101984,0,"Stability of Gas Clouds in Galactic Nuclei: An Extended Virial Theorem Cold gas entering the central $1$ to $10^2$ pc of a galaxy fragments and condenses into clouds. The stability of the clouds determines whether they will be turned into stars or can be delivered to the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) to turn on an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The conventional criteria to assess the stability of these clouds, such as the Jeans criterion and Roche (or tidal) limit, are insufficient here, because they assume the dominance of self-gravity in binding a cloud, and neglect external agents, such as pressure and tidal forces, which are common in galactic nuclei. We formulate a new scheme for judging this stability. We first revisit the conventional Virial theorem, taking into account an external pressure, to identify the correct range of masses that lead to stable clouds. We then extend the theorem to include an external tidal field, crucial for the stability in the region of interest -- in dense star clusters, around SMBHs. We apply our extended Virial theorem to find the correct solutions to practical problems that until now were controversial, namely, the stability of the gas clumps in AGN tori, the circum-nuclear disk in the Galactic Center, and the central molecular zone of the Milky Way. The masses we derive for these structures are orders of magnitude smaller than the commonly-used Virial masses (equivalent to the Jeans mass). Moreover, we prove that these clumps are stable, contrary to what one would naively deduce from the Roche (tidal) limit.",1

102192,0,"Topological and dynamical properties of a generalized cluster model in one dimension We study the ground-state phase diagram and dynamics of the one-dimensional cluster model with several competing interactions. Paying particular attention to the relation between the entanglement spectrum (ES) and the bulk topological (winding) number, we first map out the ground-state phases of the model and determine the universality classes of the transitions from the exact solution. We then investigate the dynamical properties during interaction sweeps through the critical points of topological phase transitions. When the sweep speed is slow, the correlation functions and the entanglement entropy exhibit spatially periodic structures. On top of this, the levels in the ES oscillate temporally during the dynamics. By explicitly calculating the above quantities for excited states, we attribute these behaviors to the Bogoliubov quasiparticles generated near the critical points. We also show that the ES reflects the strength of the Majorana correlation even for the excited states.",1

The conjecture is tested against numerical results and a good agreement is found.",1

In the context of a polymer solution model, we demonstrate that the new CS-CL dynamical scheme for sampling fluctuations in the space of coherent states yields results in good agreement with now-standard AF simulations.

102821,0,"Spatio-spectral concentration of convolutions Differential equations may possess coefficients that vary on a spectrum of scales. Because coefficients are typically multiplicative in real space, they turn into convolution operators in spectral space, mixing all wavenumbers. However, in many applications, only the largest scales of the solution are of interest and so the question turns to whether it is possible to build effective coarse-scale models of the coefficients in such a manner that the large scales of the solution are left intact. Here we apply the method of numerical homogenization to deterministic linear equations to generate sub-grid-scale models of coefficients at desired frequency cutoffs. We use the Fourier basis to project, filter and compute correctors for the coefficients. The method is tested in 1D and 2D scenarios and found to reproduce the coarse scales of the solution to varying degrees of accuracy depending on the cutoff. We relate this method to mode-elimination Renormalization Group (RG) and discuss the connection between accuracy and the cutoff wavenumber. The tradeoff is governed by a form of the uncertainty principle for convolutions, which states that as the convolution operator is squeezed in the spectral domain, it broadens in real space. As a consequence, basis sparsity is a high virtue and the choice of the basis can be critical.",1
102842,0,"Quantum Measurement and Initial Conditions Quantum measurement finds the observed system in a collapsed state, rather than in the state predicted by the Schr\""odinger equation. Yet there is a relatively spread opinion that the wavefunction collapse can be explained by unitary evolution (for instance in the decoherence approach, if we take into account the environment). In this article it is proven a mathematical result which severely restricts the initial conditions for which measurements have definite outcomes, if pure unitary evolution is assumed. This no-go theorem remains true even if we take the environment into account. The result does not forbid a unitary description of the measurement process, it only shows that such a description is possible only for very restricted initial conditions. The existence of such restrictions of the initial conditions can be understood in the four-dimensional block universe perspective, as a requirement of global self-consistency of the solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation.",1

Photometric and spectroscopic observations of a slowly declining, luminous Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011hr in the starburst galaxy NGC 2691 are presented. SN 2011hr is found to peak at $M_{B}=-19.84 \pm 0.40\,\rm{mag}$, with a post-maximum decline rate $\Delta$m$_{15}$(B) = 0.92 $\pm$ 0.03\,$\rm{mag}$. From the maximum-light bolometric luminosity, $L=(2.30 \pm 0.90) \times 10^{43}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, we estimate the mass of synthesized \Nifs\ in SN 2011hr to be $M(\rm{^{56}Ni})=1.11 \pm 0.43\,M_{\sun}$. SN 2011hr appears more luminous than SN 1991T at around maximum light, and the absorption features from its intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) are noticeably weaker than the latter at similar phases. Spectral modeling suggests that SN 2011hr has the IMEs of $\sim$\,0.07 M$_{\sun}$ in the outer ejecta, which is much lower than the typical value of normal SNe Ia (i.e., 0.3 -- 0.4 M$_{\sun}$) and is also lower than the value of SN 1991T (i.e., $\sim$\,0.18 M$_{\sun}$). These results indicate that SN 2011hr may arise from a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf progenitor that experienced a more efficient burning process in the explosion.

103140,0,"Baryon Cycling in the Low-Redshift Circumgalactic Medium: A Comparison of Simulations to the COS-Halos Survey We analyze the low-redshift (z~0.2) circumgalactic medium by comparing absorption-line data from the COS-Halos Survey to absorption around a matched galaxy sample from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The models include different prescriptions for galactic outflows, namely hybrid energy/momentum driven wind (ezw), and constant winds (cw). We extract for comparison direct observables including equivalent widths, covering factors, ion ratios, and kinematics. Both wind models are generally in good agreement with these observations for HI and certain low ionization metal lines, but show poorer agreement with higher ionization metal lines including SiIII and OVI that are well-observed by COS-Halos. These discrepancies suggest that both wind models predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/or that the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. This may reflect our model assumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas. Our ezw simulation includes a heuristic prescription to quench massive galaxies by super-heating its ISM gas, which we show yields sufficient low ionisation absorption to be broadly consistent with observations, but also substantial OVI absorption that is inconsistent with data, suggesting that gas around quenched galaxies in the real Universe does not cool. At impact parameters of &lt;50 kpc, recycling winds dominate the absorption of low ions and even HI, while OVI almost always arises from metals ejected longer than 1 Gyr ago. The similarity between the wind models is surprising, since we show that they differ substantially in their predicted amount and phase distribution of halo gas. We show that this similarity owes mainly to our comparison here at fixed stellar mass rather than at fixed halo mass in our previous works, which suggests that CGM properties are more closely tied to the stellar mass of galaxies rather than halo mass.",1
103320,0,"The Sizes of Globular Clusters as Tracers of Galactic Halo Potentials We present $N$-body simulations of globular clusters, exploring the effect of different galactic potentials on cluster sizes, $r_h$. For various galactocentric distances, $R_G$, we assess how cluster sizes change when we vary the virial mass and concentration of the host galaxy's dark-matter halo. We show that sizes of GCs are determined by the local galactic mass density rather than the virial mass of the host galaxy. We find that clusters evolving in the inner haloes of less concentrated galaxies are significantly more extended than those evolving in more concentrated ones, while the sizes of those orbiting in the outer halo are almost independent of concentration. Adding a baryonic component to our galaxy models does not change these results much, since its effect is only significant in the very inner halo. Our simulations suggest that there is a relation between $r_h$ and $R_G$, which systematically depends on the physical parameters of the halo. Hence, observing such relations in individual galaxies can put a new observational constraint on dark-matter halo characteristics. However, by varying the halo mass in a wide range of $10^{9}\leq M_{vir}/\msun \leq10^{13}$, we find that the $r_h-R_G$ relationship will be nearly independent of halo mass, if one assumes $M_{vir}$ and $c_{vir}$ as two correlated parameters, as is suggested by cosmological simulations.",1
103380,0,"A review of action estimation methods for galactic dynamics We review the available methods for estimating actions, angles and frequencies of orbits in both axisymmetric and triaxial potentials. The methods are separated into two classes. Unless an orbit has been trapped by a resonance, convergent, or iterative, methods are able to recover the actions to arbitrarily high accuracy given sufficient computing time. Faster non-convergent methods rely on the potential being sufficiently close to a separable potential and the accuracy of the action estimate cannot be improved through further computation. We critically compare the accuracy of the methods and the required computation time for a range of orbits in an axisymmetric multi-component Galactic potential. We introduce a new method for estimating actions that builds on the adiabatic approximation of Sch\""onich &amp; Binney (2012) and discuss the accuracy required for the actions, angles and frequencies using suitable distribution functions for the thin and thick discs, the stellar halo and a star stream. We conclude that for studies of the disc and smooth halo component of the Milky Way the most suitable compromise between speed and accuracy is the St\""ackel Fudge, whilst when studying streams the non-convergent methods do not offer sufficient accuracy and the most suitable method is computing the actions from an orbit integration via a generating function.

Our experiments demonstrated strong influence of a laser beam orientation on self-focusing of the beam and plasma generation during filamentation. Maximum of linear plasma density generated by an astigmatic laser pulse was different in both meridional and sagittal foci and depended on the beam orientation. A difference of linear plasma density was observed in the case of superposition of two parts of the laser beam going through a two-hole diaphragm depending on the beam orientation and through a slit for collinear and normal slit orientation relative to the beam orientation. Laser pulses in IR and UV wavelength domains led to similar result.,1
103752,0,"The off-centered Seyfert-like compact emission in the nuclear region of NGC 3621 We analyze an optical data cube of the nuclear region of NGC 3621, taken with the integral field unit of the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph. We found that the previously detected central line emission in this galaxy actually comes from a blob, located at a projected distance of 2.14"" +/- 0.08"" (70.1 +/- 2.6 pc) from the stellar nucleus. Only diffuse emission was detected in the rest of the field of view, with a deficit of emission at the position of the stellar nucleus. Diagnostic diagram analysis reveals that the off-centered emitting blob has a Seyfert 2 spectrum. We propose that the line-emitting blob may be a ""fossil"" emission-line region or a light ""echo"" from an active galactic nucleus (AGN), which was significantly brighter in the past. Our estimates indicate that the bolometric luminosity of the AGN must have decreased by a factor of ~13 - 500 during the last ~230 years. A second scenario to explain the morphology of the line-emitting areas in the nuclear region of NGC 3621 involves no decrease of the AGN bolometric luminosity and establishes that the AGN is highly obscured toward the observer but not toward the line-emitting blob. The third scenario proposed here assumes that the off-centered line-emitting blob is a recoiling supermassive black hole, after the coalescence of two black holes. Finally, an additional hypothesis is that the central X-ray source is not an AGN, but an X-ray binary. This idea is consistent with all the scenarios we proposed.",1
103775,0,Fast excitation of geodesic acoustic mode by energetic particle beams A new mechanism for Geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) excitation by a not fully slowed down energetic particle (EP) beam is analysed to explain experimental observations in Large Helical Device. It is shown that the positive velocity space gradient near the lower-energy end of the EP distribution function can strongly drive GAM unstable. The new features of this EP-induced GAM (EGAM) are: 1. no instability threshold in the pitch angle; 2. the EGAM frequency can be higher than the local GAM frequency; and 3. the instability growth rate is much larger than that driven by a fully slowed down EP beam.,1
103888,0,"Invisible Active Galactic Nuclei. II Radio Morphologies &amp; Five New HI 21 cm Absorption Line Detections We have selected a sample of 80 candidates for obscured radio-loud active galactic nuclei and presented their basic optical/near-infrared (NIR) properties in Paper 1. In this paper, we present both high-resolution radio continuum images for all of these sources and HI 21cm absorption spectroscopy for a few selected sources in this sample. A-configuration 4.9 and 8.5 GHz VLA continuum observations find that 52 sources are compact or have substantial compact components with size &lt;0.5"" and flux density &gt;0.1 Jy at 4.9 GHz. The most compact 36 sources were then observed with the VLBA at 1.4 GHz. One definite and 10 candidate Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are newly identified, a detection rate of CSOs ~3 times higher than the detection rate previously found in purely flux-limited samples. Based on possessing compact components with high flux densities, 60 of these sources are good candidates for absorption-line searches. Twenty seven sources were observed for HI 21cm absorption at their photometric or spectroscopic redshifts with only 6 detections made (one detection is tentative). However, five of these were from a small subset of six CSOs with pure galaxy optical/NIR spectra and for which accurate spectroscopic redshifts place the redshifted 21cm line in a RFI-free spectral window. It is likely that the presence of ubiquitous RFI and the absence of accurate spectroscopic redshifts preclude HI detections in similar sources (only one detection out of the remaining 22 sources observed, 14 of which have only photometric redshifts). Future searches for highly-redshifted HI and molecular absorption can easily find more distant CSOs among bright, blank field' radio sources but will be severely hampered by an inability to determine accurate spectroscopic redshifts for them due to their lack of rest-frame UV continuum.",1
104220,0,"Perfect Dispersive Medium Dispersion lies at the heart of real-time signal processing systems across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to optics. However, the performance and applicability of such systems have been severely plagued by distortions due to the frequency dependent nature of the amplitude response of the dispersive media used for processing. This frequency dependence is a fundamental consequence of the causality constraint, incarnated by Kramers-Kronig relations or, equivalently, by the Bode relations. In order to resolve this issue, we introduce here the concept of a \emph{perfect dispersive medium}, which is a loss-gain medium characterized by a perfectly flat magnitude response along with an arbitrary phase response. This unprecedented property results from equalized electric and magnetic dipole dispersion responses, whence the amplitude and phase of the transmission functions of the isolated loss and gain contributions become the inverse and remain the same, respectively, under reversal of the sign of the imaginary part of the equalized magneto-dielectric polarizability. Such a perfect dispersive medium may be realized in the form of a metamaterial, and the paper demonstrates a corresponding stacked loss-gain metasurface structure for illustration. From a practical standpoint, perfect dispersive media represent a paradigm shift that may propel real-time signal processing technology to a new dimension, with a myriad of novel ultrafast communication, sensing, imaging and instrumentation applications.",1
104230,0,"Swelling Mechanism of Lattice with the Ingrowth of the Defects in UO2 Swelling of uranium dioxide with ingrowth of defects by irradiation is not fully understood. Experimental and theoretical groups have attempted to explain this phenomenon with various complex theories. In this study, experimental lattice expansion and super saturation of the lattice were well reproduced by molecular dynamics simulation method. From the resemblance with the experimental data, here it is manifested that only oxygen frenkel pairs were created in the fission induced lattice while alpha particle radiation causes both oxygen and considerable amount of uranium defects. Moreover, in this work, defects are divided into two sub-groups as obstruction and distortion and it is shown that obstruction type frenkel pairs merely responsible for the lattice swelling for both fission and alpha particle radiation. Evidently relative lattice expansion varies linearly with the obstruction type of survived uranium defects. Additionally, at high concentrations, some of the obstruction type uranium frenkel pairs forming double or triple structures with oxygens in their octahedral cages which increase the slope of the linear dependence.",1

In this Letter Cluster multi-point observations are used to investigate the distribution of magnetic field discontinuities and the associated small-scale current sheets in the terrestrial magnetosheath downstream of a quasi-parallel bow shock. It is shown experimentally, for the first time, that the strongest turbulence generated current sheets occupy the long tails of probability distribution functions (PDFs) associated with extremal values of magnetic field partial derivatives. During the analyzed one hour long time interval, about a hundred strong discontinuities, possibly proton-scale current sheets were observed.",1

104488,0,"B\^ocher Contractions of Conformally Superintegrable Laplace Equations The explicit solvability of quantum superintegrable systems is due to symmetry, but the symmetry is often ""hidden"". The symmetry generators of 2nd order superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions close under commutation to define quadratic algebras, a generalization of Lie algebras. Distinct systems on constant curvature spaces are related by geometric limits, induced by generalized In\""on\""u-Wigner Lie algebra contractions of the symmetry algebras of the underlying spaces. These have physical/geometric implications, such as the Askey scheme for hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. However, the limits have no satisfactory Lie algebra contraction interpretations for underlying spaces with 1- or 0-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that these systems can be best understood by transforming them to Laplace conformally superintegrable systems, with flat space conformal symmetry group ${\rm SO}(4,{\mathbb C})$, and using ideas introduced in the 1894 thesis of B\^ocher to study separable solutions of the wave equation in terms of roots of quadratic forms. We show that B\^ocher's prescription for coalescing roots of these forms induces contractions of the conformal algebra $\mathfrak{so}(4,{\mathbb C})$ to itself and yields a mechanism for classifying all Helmholtz superintegrable systems and their limits. In the paper [Acta Polytechnica, to appear, arXiv:1510.09067], we announced our main findings. This paper provides the proofs and more details.",1

104522,0,"Boundary between Stable and Unstable Regimes of Accretion. Ordered and Chaotic Unstable Regimes We present a study of the Rayleigh-Taylor unstable regime of accretion onto rotating magnetized stars in a set of high grid resolution three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations performed in low-viscosity discs. We find that the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes is determined almost entirely by the fastness parameter omega_s=Omega_star/Omega_K(r_m), where Omega_star is the angular velocity of the star and Omega_K(r_m) is the angular velocity of the Keplerian disc at the disc-magnetosphere boundary r=r_m. We found that accretion is unstable if omega_s &lt; 0.6. Accretion through instabilities is present in stars with different magnetospheric sizes. However, only in stars with relatively small magnetospheres, r_m/R_star &lt; 7, do the unstable tongues produce chaotic hot spots on the stellar surface and irregular light-curves. At even smaller values of the fastness parameter, omega_s &lt; 0.45, multiple irregular tongues merge, forming one or two ordered unstable tongues that rotate with the angular frequency of the inner disc. This transition occurs in stars with even smaller magnetospheres, r_m/R_star &lt; 4.2. Most of our simulations were performed at a small tilt of the dipole magnetosphere, Theta=5 degrees, and a small viscosity parameter alpha=0.02. Test simulations at higher alpha values show that many more cases become unstable, and the light-curves become even more irregular. Test simulations at larger tilts of the dipole Theta show that instability is present, however, accretion in two funnel streams dominates if Theta &gt; 15 degrees. The results of these simulations can be applied to accreting magnetized stars with relatively small magnetospheres: Classical T Tauri stars, accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, and cataclysmics variables.",1
104529,0,"On the Progenitors of Local Group Novae. II. The Red Giant Nova Rate of M31 In our preceding paper, Liverpool Telescope data of M31 novae in eruption were used to facilitate a search for their progenitor systems within archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, with the aim of detecting systems with red giant secondaries (RG-novae) or luminous accretion disks. From an input catalog of 38 spectroscopically confirmed novae with archival quiescent observations, likely progenitors were recovered for eleven systems. Here we present the results of the subsequent statistical analysis of the original survey, including possible biases associated with the survey and the M31 nova population in general. As part of this analysis we examine the distribution of optical decline times (t(2)) of M31 novae, how the likely bulge and disk nova distributions compare, and how the M31 t(2) distribution compares to that of the Milky Way. Using a detailed Monte Carlo simulation, we determine that 30 (+13/-10) percent of all M31 nova eruptions can be attributed to RG-nova systems, and at the 99 percent confidence level, &gt;10 percent of all M31 novae are RG-novae. This is the first estimate of a RG-nova rate of an entire galaxy. Our results also imply that RG-novae in M31 are more likely to be associated with the M31 disk population than the bulge, indeed the results are consistent with all RG-novae residing in the disk. If this result is confirmed in other galaxies, it suggests any Type Ia supernovae that originate from RG-nova systems are more likely to be associated with younger populations, and may be rare in old stellar populations, such as early-type galaxies.",1

We propose an experiment for a quantum mechanical realization of a PT-symmetric system, where the PT-symmetric currents are implemented by an accelerating Bose-Einstein condensate in a titled optical lattice. A defect consisting of two wells at the same energy level then acts as a PT-symmetric double-well if the tilt in the energy offsets of all further wells in the lattice is varied in time. We map the time-dependence of the amplitudes of a frozen Gaussian variational ansatz to a matrix model and increase the system size step by step starting with a six-well setup. In terms of this simple matrix model we derive conditions under which two wells of the Hermitian multi-well system behave exactly as the two wells of the PT-symmetric system.",1

We apply the crystal framework to products of a Schur function with a $k$-Schur function, consequently proving that a subclass of 3-point Gromov-Witten invariants of complete flag varieties for $\mathbb C^n$ enumerate the highest weight elements under these operators. Included in this class are the Schubert structure constants in the (quantum) product of a Schubert polynomial with a Schur function $s_\lambda$ for all $|\lambda^\vee|&lt; n$.

We first identify a population of radio, X-ray, and infrared-selected AGN by cross-matching the deep $K_{s}$-band imaging of ZFOURGE with overlapping multi-wavelength data. From this, we construct a mass-complete (log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) $\ge$ 9.75), AGN luminosity limited sample of 235 AGN hosts over z = 0.2 - 3.2. We compare the rest-frame U - V versus V - J (UVJ) colours and specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) of the AGN hosts to a mass-matched control sample of inactive (non-AGN) galaxies. UVJ diagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent galaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample. Using 160{\mu}m Herschel PACS data, we find the mean specific star-formation rate of AGN hosts to be elevated by 0.34$\pm$0.07 dex with respect to the control sample across all redshifts. This offset is primarily driven by infrared-selected AGN, where the mean sSFR is found to be elevated by as much as a factor of ~5. The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray AGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a marginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and postulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderating galaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.",1

More precisely, we consider the Einstein equations coupled with the scalar field equations and study the system $Ein(g)=T$, $T=T(g,\phi)+F_1$, and $\square_g\phi-\mathcal V^\prime(\phi)=F_2$, where the sources $F=(F_1,F_2)$ correspond to perturbations of the physical fields which we control.

By applying the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm and calculating the entanglement entropy we show that in the anisotropic case a phase transition occurs and a N\'eel state emerges above a critical value of the Coulomb interaction.

105679,0,"Detecting Unspecified Structure in Low-Count Images Unexpected structure in images of astronomical sources often presents itself upon visual inspection of the image, but such apparent structure may either correspond to true features in the source or be due to noise in the data. This paper presents a method for testing whether inferred structure in an image with Poisson noise represents a significant departure from a baseline (null) model of the image. To infer image structure, we conduct a Bayesian analysis of a full model that uses a multiscale component to allow flexible departures from the posited null model. As a test statistic, we use a tail probability of the posterior distribution under the full model. This choice of test statistic allows us to estimate a computationally efficient upper bound on a p-value that enables us to draw strong conclusions even when there are limited computational resources that can be devoted to simulations under the null model. We demonstrate the statistical performance of our method on simulated images. Applying our method to an X-ray image of the quasar 0730+257, we find significant evidence against the null model of a single point source and uniform background, lending support to the claim of an X-ray jet.",1

The differences in the wave function describing the electrons in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field in graphene with respect to the conventional semiconductors, such as GaAs, can be captured in a form factor which carries the Landau level index. This leads to a quantitative difference in the electron-solid and -liquid energies. For the lowest Landau level, there is no difference in the wave function of relativistic and non-relativistic systems. We compute the cohesive energy of the solid phase analytically using a Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian. The liquid energies are computed analytically as well as numerically, using exact diagonalization.

106137,0,"Self-consistent Monte Carlo simulations of proton acceleration in coronal shocks: Effect of anisotropic pitch-angle scattering of particles Context. Solar energetic particles observed in association with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are produced by the CME-driven shock waves. The acceleration of particles is considered to be due to diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Aims. We aim at a better understanding of DSA in the case of quasi-parallel shocks, in which self-generated turbulence in the shock vicinity plays a key role. Methods. We have developed and applied a new Monte Carlo simulation code for acceleration of protons in parallel coronal shocks. The code performs a self-consistent calculation of resonant interactions of particles with Alfv\'en waves based on the quasi-linear theory. In contrast to the existing Monte Carlo codes of DSA, the new code features the full quasi-linear resonance condition of particle pitch-angle scattering. This allows us to take anisotropy of particle pitch-angle scattering into account, while the older codes implement an approximate resonance condition leading to isotropic scattering.We performed simulations with the new code and with an old code, applying the same initial and boundary conditions, and have compared the results provided by both codes with each other, and with the predictions of the steady-state theory. Results. We have found that anisotropic pitch-angle scattering leads to less efficient acceleration of particles than isotropic. However, extrapolations to particle injection rates higher than those we were able to use suggest the capability of DSA to produce relativistic particles. The particle and wave distributions in the foreshock as well as their time evolution, provided by our new simulation code, are significantly different from the previous results and from the steady-state theory. Specifically, the mean free path in the simulations with the new code is increasing with energy, in contrast to the theoretical result.",1

106251,0,"The final fate of stars that ignite neon and oxygen off-center: electron capture or iron core-collapse supernova? In the ONeMg cores of $8.8-9.5~{\rm M}_\odot$ stars, neon and oxygen burning is ignited off-center. Whether the neon-oxygen flame propagates to the center is critical to determine whether these stars undergo Fe core collapse or electron capture induced ONeMg core collapse. We present more details of stars that ignite neon and oxygen burning off-center. The neon flame is established in a similar manner to the carbon flame of super-AGB stars, albeit with a narrower flame width. The criteria for establishing a flame are able to be met if the strict Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability is adopted. Mixing across the interface of the convective shell disrupts the conditions for the propagation of the burning front and instead the shell burns as a series of inward-moving flashes. While this may not directly affect whether the burning will reach the center (as in super-AGB stars), the core is allowed to contract between each shell flash. Reduction of the electron fraction in the shell reduces the Chandrasekhar mass and the center reaches the threshold density for the URCA process to activate and steer the remaining evolution of the core. This highlights the importance of a more accurate treatment of mixing in the stellar interior for yet another important question in stellar astrophysics - determining the properties of stellar evolution and supernova progenitors at the boundary between electron capture supernova and iron core-collapse supernova.",1

The appealing simplicity of this self-consistent recursion relation along with its low computational complexity could prove useful as an alternative to diagonalization in solving dense and sparse matrix eigenvalue problems.",1
106421,0,"Symmetry Protected Topological Phases and Majorana Mode in One-dimensional Quantum Walk with Boundary The topological phases in one-dimensional quantum walk can be classified by the coin parameters. By solving for the general exact solutions of bound states in one-dimensional quantum walk with boundaries specified by different coin parameters, we show that these bound states are Majorana modes with quasi-energy $E=0,\pi$. These modes are qualitatively different for different boundary conditions used. For two-boundary system with symmetric boundary conditions, the interaction energy between two Majorana bound states can be computed, as in the case of a finite wire. Suggestion of observing these modes are provided.",1
106431,0,"EMBRACE@Nancay: An Ultra Wide Field of View Prototype for the SKA A revolution in radio receiving technology is underway with the development of densely packed phased arrays for radio astronomy. This technology can provide an exceptionally large field of view, while at the same time sampling the sky with high angular resolution. Such an instrument, with a field of view of over 100 square degrees, is ideal for performing fast, all-sky, surveys, such as the ""intensity mapping"" experiment to measure the signature of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations in the HI mass distribution at cosmological redshifts. The SKA, built with this technology, will be able to do a billion galaxy survey.

This will be followed by a description of the EMBRACE prototype and a discussion of results and future plans.",1
106627,0,"The local description of the Ricci and Bianchi identities for an h-normal N-linear connection on the dual 1-jet space J^{1*}(T,M) In this paper we describe the local Ricci and Bianchi identities for an h-normal N-linear connection D\Gamma(N) on the dual 1-jet space J^{1*}(T,M). To reach this aim, we firstly give the expressions of the local distinguished (d-) adapted components of torsion and curvature tensors produced by D\Gamma(N), and then we analyze their attached local Ricci identities. The derived deflection d-tensor identities are also presented. Finally, we expose the local expressions of the Bianchi identities (in the particular case of an h-normal N-linear connection of Cartan type), which geometrically connect the local torsion and curvature d-tensors of the linear connection D\Gamma(N).",1
106714,0,"The nature of the UV halo around the spiral galaxy NGC 3628 Thanks to deep UV observations with GALEX and Swift, diffuse UV haloes have recently been discovered around galaxies. Based on UV-optical colours, it has been advocated that the UV haloes around spiral galaxies are due to UV radiation emitted from the disc and scattered off dust grains at high latitudes. Detailed UV radiative transfer models that take into account scattering and absorption can explain the morphology of the UV haloes, and they require the presence of an additional thick dust disc next the to traditional thin disc for half of the galaxies in their sample. We test whether such an additional thick dust disc agrees with the observed infrared emission in NGC 3628, an edge-on galaxy with a clear signature of a thick dust disc. We extend the far-ultraviolet radiative transfer models to full-scale panchromatic models. Our model, which contains no fine-tuning, can almost perfectly reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution from UV to mm wavelengths. These results corroborate the interpretation of the extended UV emission in NGC 3628 as scattering off dust grains, and hence of the presence of a substantial amount of diffuse extra-planar dust. A significant caveat, however, is the geometrical simplicity and non-uniqueness of our model: other models with a different geometrical setting could lead to a similar spectral energy distribution. More detailed radiative transfer simulations that compare the model results to images from UV to submm wavelengths are a way to break this degeneracy, as are UV polarisation measurements.",1

We show that they originate from the wavefront evolution under paraxial propagation in the presence of wavefront- and intensity-profile perturbations.",1
106832,0,"Monitoring in the Clouds: Comparison of ECO2Clouds and EXCESS Monitoring Approaches With the increasing adoption of private cloud infrastructures by providers and enterprises, the monitoring of these infrastructures is becoming crucial. The rationale behind monitoring is manifold: reasons include saving energy, lowering costs, and better maintenance. In the e-Science sector, moreover, the collection of infrastructure and application-specific data at high resolutions is immanent. In this paper, we present two monitoring approaches implemented throughout two European projects: ECO2Clouds and EXCESS. The ECO2Clouds project aims to minimize CO2 emissions caused by the execution of applications on the cloud infrastructure. In order to allow for eco-aware deployment and scheduling of applications, the ECO2Clouds monitoring framework provides the necessary set of metrics on different layers including physical, virtual and application layer. In turn, the EXCESS project introduces new energy-aware execution models that improve energy-efficiency on a software level. Having in-depth knowledge about the energy consumption and overall behavior of applications on a given infrastructure, subsequent executions can be optimized to save energy. To achieve this goal, the EXCESS monitoring framework provides APIs allowing developers to collect application-specific data in addition to infrastructure data at run-time. We perform a comparative analysis of both monitoring approaches, and highlighting use cases including a hybrid approach which benefits from both monitoring solutions.",1
106855,0,"Non-parametric analysis of the rest-frame UV sizes and morphological disturbance amongst L* galaxies at 4 We present the results of a study investigating the sizes and morphologies of redshift 4 &lt; z &lt; 8 galaxies in the CANDELS GOODS-S, HUDF and HUDF parallel fields. Based on non-parametric measurements and incorporating a careful treatment of measurement biases, we quantify the typical size of galaxies at each redshift as the peak of the log-normal size distribution, rather than the arithmetic mean size. Parameterizing the evolution of galaxy half-light radius as $r_{50} \propto (1+z)^n$, we find $n = -0.20 \pm 0.26$ at bright UV-luminosities ($0.3L_{*(z=3)} &lt; L &lt; L_*$) and $n = -0.47 \pm 0.62$ at faint luminosities ($0.12L_* &lt; L &lt; 0.3L_*$). Furthermore, simulations based on artificially redshifting our z~4 galaxy sample show that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no size evolution. We show that this result is caused by a combination of the size-dependent completeness of high-redshift galaxy samples and the underestimation of the sizes of the largest galaxies at a given epoch. To explore the evolution of galaxy morphology we first compare asymmetry measurements to those from a large sample of simulated single S\'ersic profiles, in order to robustly categorise galaxies as either `smooth' or `disturbed'. Comparing the disturbed fraction amongst bright ($M_{UV} \leq -20$) galaxies at each redshift to that obtained by artificially redshifting our z~4 galaxy sample, while carefully matching the size and UV-luminosity distributions, we find no clear evidence for evolution in galaxy morphology over the redshift interval 4 &lt; z &lt; 8. Therefore, based on our results, a bright ($M_{UV} \leq -20$) galaxy at z~6 is no more likely to be measured as `disturbed' than a comparable galaxy at z~4, given the current observational constraints.",1
106925,0,"The bulge-disk decomposition of AGN host galaxies We present the results from a study of the morphologies of moderate luminosity X-ray selected AGN host galaxies in comparison to a carefully mass-matched control sample at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 in the CANDELS GOODS-S field. We apply a multi-wavelength morphological decomposition analysis to these two samples and report on the differences between the morphologies as fitted from single Sersic and multiple Sersic models, and models which include an additional nuclear point-source component. Thus, we are able to compare the widely adopted single Sersic fits from previous studies to the results from a full morphological decomposition, and address the issue of how biased the inferred properties of AGN hosts are by a potential nuclear contribution from the AGN itself. We find that the AGN hosts are mixed systems which have higher bulge fractions than the control sample in our highest redshift bins at the &gt;99.7% confidence level, according to all model fits even those which adopt a point-source component. This serves to alleviate concerns that previous, purely single Sersic, analyses of AGN hosts could have been spuriously biased towards higher bulge fractions. This dataset allows us to further probe the physical nature of these point-source components; we find no strong correlation between the point-source component and AGN activity, and that these point-source components are best modelled physically by nuclear starbursts. Our analysis of the bulge and disk fractions of these AGN hosts in comparison to a mass-matched control sample reveals a similar morphological evolutionary track for both the active and non-active populations, providing further evidence in favour of a model where AGN activity is triggered by secular processes.",1
107026,0,"Spin dynamics in relativistic light-matter interaction Various spin effects are expected to become observable in light-matter interaction at relativistic intensities. Relativistic quantum mechanics equipped with a suitable relativistic spin operator forms the theoretical foundation for describing these effects. Various proposals for relativistic spin operators have been offered by different authors, which are presented in a unified way. As a result of the operators' mathematical properties only the Foldy-Wouthuysen operator and the Pryce operator qualify as possible proper relativistic spin operators. The ground states of highly charged hydrogen-like ions can be utilized to identify a legitimate relativistic spin operator experimentally. Subsequently, the Foldy-Wothuysen spin operator is employed to study electron-spin precession in high-intensity standing light waves with elliptical polarization. For a correct theoretical description of the predicted electron-spin precession relativistic effects due to the spin angular momentum of the electromagnetic wave has to be taken into account even in the limit of low intensities.",1

The magnetic signal manifests itself as a redistribution of intensity in diffraction patterns due to a change of sign of the orbital angular moment. While in the atomic resolution regime the magnetic signal is most likely under the detection limits of present transmission electron microscopes, for electron probes with high orbital angular momenta, and correspondingly larger spatial extent, its detection is predicted to be feasible.",1
107124,0,"Theory of Thomson scattering in inhomogeneous media Thomson scattering of laser light is one of the most fundamental diagnostics of plasma density, temperature and magnetic fields. It relies on the assumption that the properties in the probed volume are homogeneous and constant during the probing time. On the other hand, laboratory plasmas are seldom uniform and homogeneous on the temporal and spatial dimensions over which data is collected. This is partic- ularly true for laser-produced high-energy-density matter, which often exhibits steep gradients in temperature, density and pressure, on a scale determined by the laser focus. Here, we discuss the modification of the cross section for Thomson scattering in fully-ionized media exhibiting steep spatial inhomogeneities and/or fast temporal fluctuations. We show that the predicted Thomson scattering spectra are greatly altered compared to the uniform case, and may even lead to violations of detailed balance. Therefore, careful interpretation of the spectra is necessary for spatially or temporally inhomogeneous systems.",1
107214,0,"Improving LSST Photometric Calibration with Gaia Data We consider the possibility that the Gaia mission can supply data which will improve the photometric calibration of LSST. After outlining the LSST calibra- tion process and the information that will be available from Gaia, we explore two options for using Gaia data. The first is to use Gaia G-band photometry of selected stars, in conjunction with knowledge of the stellar parameters Teff, log g, and AV, and in some cases Z, to create photometric standards in the LSST u, g, r, i, z, and y bands. The accuracies of the resulting standard magnitudes are found to be insufficient to satisfy LSST requirements when generated from main sequence (MS) stars, but generally adequate from DA white dwarfs (WD). The second option is combine the LSST bandpasses into a synthetic Gaia G band, which is a close approximation to the real Gaia G band. This allows synthetic Gaia G photometry to be directly compared with actual Gaia G photometry at a level of accuracy which is useful for both verifying and improving LSST photometric calibration.",1

These systems have a global U(1)+U(1) symmetry, as the system Hamiltonian is invariant under independent U(1) transformations acting on each species. In particular, we consider the three-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model for two lattice bosonic gases coupled by an on-site inter-species density-density interaction. We study the phase diagram and the critical behaviors along the transition lines characterized by the Bose-Einstein condensation of one or both species. We present mean-field calculations and numerical finite-size scaling analyses of quantum Monte Carlo data. We also consider multicritical points, close to which it is possible to observe the condensation of both gas components. We determine the possible multicritical behaviors by using field-theoretical perturbative methods. We consider the U(1)+U(1)-symmetric Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Phi4 theory and determine the corresponding stable fixed points of the renormalization-group flow. The analysis predicts that, in all cases, the multicritical behavior is analogous to the one that would be observed in systems of two identical gases, with an additional Z_2 exchange symmetry.",1

The endergonic SF is found to be facilitated by the robust quantum coherence, which concurrently gives rise to a notable quantum beating effect. Controlled by the nonlocal electron-phonon coupling, the density of triplet yield manifests a nonlinear relationship with the singlet density. As a result, the fission rate in tetracene is explicitly obtained, which is in agreement with the experimental measurement.",1

For each code represented we have a dark matter only (DM) and non-radiative (NR) version of the cluster, as well as a full physics (FP) version for a subset of the codes. We compare both radial mass and kinematic profiles, as well as global measures of the cluster (e.g. concentration, spin, shape), in the NR and FP runs with that in the DM runs. Our analysis reveals good consistency (&lt;= 20%) between global properties of the cluster predicted by different codes when integrated quantities are measured within the virial radius R200. However, we see larger differences for quantities within R2500, especially in the FP runs. The radial profiles reveal a diversity, especially in the cluster centre, between the NR runs, which can be understood straightforwardly from the division of codes into classic SPH and non-classic SPH (including the modern SPH, adaptive and moving mesh codes); and between the FP runs, which can also be understood broadly from the division of codes into those that include AGN feedback and those that do not. The variation with respect to the median is much larger in the FP runs with different baryonic physics prescriptions than in the NR runs with different hydrodynamics solvers.",1
107470,0,Relativistic polarizabilities with the Lagrange-mesh method Relativistic dipolar to hexadecapolar polarizabilities of the ground state and some excited states of hydrogenic atoms are calculated by using numerically exact energies and wave functions obtained from the Dirac equation with the Lagrange-mesh method. This approach is an approximate variational method taking the form of equations on a grid because of the use of a Gauss quadrature approximation. The partial polarizabilities conserving the absolute value of the quantum number $\kappa$ are also numerically exact with small numbers of mesh points. The ones where $|\kappa|$ changes are very accurate when using three different meshes for the initial and final wave functions and for the calculation of matrix elements. The polarizabilities of the $n=2$ excited states of hydrogenic atoms are also studied with a separate treatment of the final states that are degenerate at the nonrelativistic approximation. The method provides high accuracies for polarizabilities of a particle in a Yukawa potential and is applied to a hydrogen atom embedded in a Debye plasma.,1

Here we present the model and algorithm used in the JSPAM code. A precursor of this code was originally described in 1990, and was called SPAM.

107613,0,"Interrupted Binary Mass Transfer in Star Clusters Binary mass transfer is at the forefront of some of the most exciting puzzles of modern astrophysics, including Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and the formation of most observed exotic stellar populations. Typically, the evolution is assumed to proceed in isolation, even in dense stellar environments such as star clusters. In this paper, we test the validity of this assumption via the analysis of a large grid of binary evolution models simulated with the SeBa code. For every binary, we calculate analytically the mean time until another single or binary star comes within the mean separation of the mass-transferring binary, and compare this time-scale to the mean time for stable mass transfer to occur. We then derive the probability for each respective binary to experience a direct dynamical interruption. The resulting probability distribution can be integrated to give an estimate for the fraction of binaries undergoing mass transfer that are expected to be disrupted as a function of the host cluster properties. We find that for lower-mass clusters ($\lesssim 10^4$ M$_{\odot}$), on the order of a few to a few tens of percent of binaries undergoing mass-transfer are expected to be interrupted by an interloping single, or more often binary, star, over the course of the cluster lifetime, whereas in more massive globular clusters we expect $\ll$ 1% to be interrupted. Furthermore, using numerical scattering experiments performed with the FEWBODY code, we show that the probability of interruption increases if perturbative fly-bys are considered as well, by a factor $\sim 2$.",1
107620,0,"On the Existence of Additional (Hydrino) states in the Dirac equation In case of spinless particles there appear additional (singular) solutions in the framework of relativistic Klein-Gordon equation for Coulomb potential. These solutions obey to all requirements of quantum mechanical general principles. Observation of such states (hydrino, small hydrogen) should be important for manifestation of various physical phenomena. In this article the same problem is considered for spin-1/2 particle (electron) in the Dirac equation. It is shown that such kind of solutions really occurs, but the rate of singularity is more higher than in spinless case. By this reason we have no time- independence of total probability (norm). Moreover the orthogonality property is also failed, while the total probability is finite in the certain area of the model-parameters. Therefore, we are inclined to conclude that this additional solution in the Dirac equation must be ignored and restrict ourselves only by normal (standard) solutions.",1

108068,0,"Interacting weak topological insulators and their transition to Dirac semimetal phases Topological insulators in the presence of strong Coulomb interaction constitute novel phases of matter. Transitions between these phases can be driven by single-particle or many-body effects. On the basis of {\it ab-initio} calculations, we identify a concrete material, {\it i.e.} Ca$_{2}$PtO$_{4}$, that turns out to be a hole-doped weak topological insulator. Interestingly, the Pt-$d$ orbitals in this material are relevant for the band inversion that gives rise to the topological phase. Therefore, Coulomb interaction should be of importance in Ca$_{2}$PtO$_{4}$. To study the influence of interactions on the weak topological insulating phase, we look at a toy model corresponding to a layer-stacked 3D version of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with local interactions. For small to intermediate interaction strength, we discover novel interaction-driven topological phase transitions between the weak topological insulator and two Dirac semimetal phases. The latter correspond to gapless topological phases. For strong interactions, the system eventually becomes a Mott insulator.",1

Objects with large, |\Delta g|&gt;1 mag photometric variations in their light curves are selected as candidates to look for changes in broad emission line (BEL) features. Out of a sample of 1011 objects that satisfy our selection criteria and have more than one epoch of spectroscopy, we find 10 examples of quasars that have variable and/or ""changing-look"" BEL features. Four of our objects have emerging BELs; five have disappearing BELs, and one object shows tentative evidence for having both emerging and disappearing BELs. With redshifts in the range 0.20 &lt; z &lt; 0.63, this sample includes the highest-redshift changing-look quasars discovered to date. We highlight the quasar J102152.34+464515.6 at z = 0.204. Here, not only have the Balmer emission lines strongly diminished in prominence, including H$\beta$ all but disappearing, but the blue continuum $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1/3}$ typical of an AGN is also significantly diminished in the second epoch of spectroscopy. Using our selection criteria, we estimate that &gt;15% of strongly variable luminous quasars display changing-look BEL features on rest-frame timescales of 8 to 10 years. Plausible timescales for variable dust extinction are factors of 2-10 too long to explain the dimming and brightening in these sources, and simple dust reddening models cannot reproduce the BEL changes. On the other hand, an advancement such as disk reprocessing is needed if the observed variations are due to accretion rate changes.",1

108449,0,"Conditions for electron-cyclotron maser emission in the solar corona Context. The Sun is an active source of radio emission ranging from long duration radio bursts associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections to more complex, short duration radio bursts such as solar S bursts, radio spikes and fibre bursts. While plasma emission is thought to be the dominant emission mechanism for most radio bursts, the electron-cyclotron maser (ECM) mechanism may be responsible for more complex, short-duration bursts as well as fine structures associated with long-duration bursts. Aims. We investigate the conditions for ECM in the solar corona by considering the ratio of the electron plasma frequency {\omega}p to the electron-cyclotron frequency {\Omega}e. The ECM is theoretically possible when {\omega}p/{\Omega}e &lt; 1. Methods. Two-dimensional electron density, magnetic field, plasma frequency, and electron cyclotron frequency maps of the off- limb corona were created using observations from SDO/AIA and SOHO/LASCO, together with potential field extrapolations of the magnetic field. These maps were then used to calculate {\omega}p/{\Omega}e and Alfven velocity maps of the off-limb corona. Results. We found that the condition for ECM emission ({\omega}p/{\Omega}e &lt; 1) is possible at heights &lt; 1.07 R_sun in an active region near the limb; that is, where magnetic field strengths are &gt; 40 G and electron densities are greater than 3x10^8 cm-3. In addition, we found comparatively high Alfv\'en velocities (&gt; 0.02 c or &gt; 6000 km s-1) at heights &lt; 1.07 R_sun within the active region. Conclusions. This demonstrates that the condition for ECM emission is satisfied within areas of the corona containing large magnetic fields, such as the core of a large active region. Therefore, ECM could be a possible emission mechanism for high-frequency radio and microwave bursts.",1

The function $\theta(\bf r)$ is fully compatible with constraints imposed by the superfluid, by the vortices, and by the object's geometry. Most efforts are focused on the torus geometry. It is demonstrated that while any compact geometry requires a vortex defect to be accompanied by an anti-vortex defect, the flat torus geometry prescribes a minimum of two vortex anti-vortex pairs. A parallelogram, formed by these four defects, is the minimal configuration compatible with the torus periodic boundary conditions.

Nevertheless, the modified structure is stable up to the dose of 5.2 dpa without obvious lattice disorder. The three samples irradiated to doses above 1 dpa have comparable lattice parameters and hardness values, suggesting a saturation of irradiation effects in Cr2AlC. The structural transition and irradiation effects saturation are ascribed to irradiation-induced antisite defects (CrAl and AlCr) and C interstitials, which is supported by the calculations of the formation energies of various defects in Cr2AlC.

108895,0,"Quantum solitons with emergent interactions in a model of cold atoms on the triangular lattice Cold atoms bring new opportunities to study quantum magnetism, and in particular, to simulate quantum magnets with symmetry greater than $SU(2)$. Here we explore the topological excitations which arise in a model of cold atoms on the triangular lattice with $SU(3)$ symmetry. Using a combination of homotopy analysis and analytic field-theory we identify a new family of solitonic wave functions characterised by integer charge ${\bf Q} = (Q_A, Q_B, Q_C)$, with $Q_A + Q_B + Q_C = 0$. We use a numerical approach, based on a variational wave function, to explore the stability of these solitons on a finite lattice. We find that, while solitons with charge ${\bf Q} = (Q, -Q, 0)$ are stable, wave functions with more general charge spontaneously decay into pairs of solitons with emergent interactions. This result suggests that it could be possible to realise a new class of interacting soliton, with no classical analogue, using cold atoms. It also suggests the possibility of a new form of quantum spin liquid, with gauge--group U(1)$\times$U(1).",1

109075,0,"Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Type-II Weyl State in YbMnBi2 Detection of Dirac, Majorana and Weyl fermions in real materials may significantly strengthen the bridge between high-energy and condensed-matter physics. While the presence of Dirac fermions is well established in graphene and topological insulators, Majorana particles have been reported recently and evidence for Weyl fermions in non-centrosymmetric crystals has been found only a couple of months ago, the 'magnetic' Weyl fermions are still elusive despite numerous theoretical predictions and intense experimental search. In order to detect a time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl state we designed two materials with Fermi velocities superior to that of graphene and present here the experimental evidence of the realization of such a state in one of them, YbMnBi2. We model the time reversal symmetry breaking observed by magnetization measurements by a canted antiferromagnetic state and find a number of Weyl points both above and below the Fermi level. Using angle-resolved photoemission, we directly observe these latter Weyl points and a hallmark of the exotic state - the arc of the surface states which connects these points. Our results not only provide a fundamental link between the two areas of physics, but also demonstrate the practical way to design novel materials with exotic properties.",1
109091,0,"An investigation of equilibration in small quantum systems: the example of a particle in a 1D random potential We investigate the equilibration of a small isolated quantum system by means of its matrix of asymptotic transition probabilities in a preferential basis. The trace of this matrix is shown to measure the degree of equilibration of the system launched from a typical state, from the standpoint of the chosen basis. This approach is substantiated by an in-depth study of the example of a tight-binding particle in one dimension. In the regime of free ballistic propagation, the above trace saturates to a finite limit, testifying good equilibration. In the presence of a random potential, the trace grows linearly with the system size, testifying poor equilibration in the insulating regime induced by Anderson localization. In the weak-disorder situation of most interest, a universal finite-size scaling law describes the crossover between the ballistic and localized regimes. The associated crossover exponent 2/3 is dictated by the anomalous band-edge scaling characterizing the most localized energy eigenstates.",1

This paper shows that standard templates contain an anomaly in that the width of the template light curve is proportional to the emitted wavelength. Furthermore this anomaly is exactly what would be produced if epoch differences were not subject to time dilation and yet time dilation corrections were applied. It is the specific nature of this anomaly that is evidence for a static universe. The lack of time dilation is verified by direct analysis of the original supernovae data.,1

To solve the difficulty of projecting speckles or modulated light patterns onto tiny biological objects, we instead focus the microscopic image onto the DMD. With this system, we have successfully obtained a magnified image of micron-sized objects illuminated by the microscope's own incandescent lamp. The image quality of our scheme is more than an order of magnitude better than that obtained by conventional compressed sensing with the same total sampling rate, and moreover, the system is robust against intensity instabilities of the light source and may be used under very weak light conditions. Since only one reflection direction of the DMD is used, the other reflection arm is left open for future infrared light sampling.

109604,0,"Synergizing superresolution optical fluctuation imaging with single molecule localization microscopy Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques enable imaging biological samples well beyond the diffraction limit of light, but they vary significantly in their spatial and temporal resolutions. High-order statistical analysis of temporal fluctuations as in superresolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) also enable imaging beyond diffraction limit, but usually at a lower resolution as compared to SMLM. Since the same data format is acquired for both methods, their algorithms can be applied to the same data set, and thus may be combined synergistically to improve overall imaging performance. Here, we find that SOFI converges much faster than SMLM, provides additive information to SMLM, and can efficiently reject background. We then show how SOFI-assisted SMLM imaging can improve SMLM image reconstruction by rejecting common sources of background, especially under low signal-to-background conditions. The performance of our approach was evaluated using a realistic simulation of fluorescence imaging we developed and further demonstrated on experimental SMLM images of the plasma membrane of activated fixed and live T cells. Our approach significantly enhances SMLM performance under demanding imaging conditions and could set an example for synergizing additional imaging techniques.",1

110412,0,"Multiplons in the two-hole excitation spectra of the one-dimensional Hubbard model Using the density-matrix renormalization group in combination with the Chebyshev polynomial expansion technique, we study the two-hole excitation spectrum of the one-dimensional Hubbard model in the entire filling range from the completely occupied band (n=2) down to half-filling (n=1). For strong interactions, the spectra reveal multiplon physics, i.e., relevant final states are characterized by two (doublon), three (triplon), four (quadruplon) and more holes, potentially forming stable compound objects or resonances with finite lifetime. These give rise to several satellites in the spectra with largely different spectral weights as well as to different continua. The complex multiplon phenomenology is analyzed by interpreting not only local and k-resolved two-hole spectra but also three- and four-hole spectra for the Hubbard model and by referring to effective low-energy models. In addition, a filter-operator technique is presented which allows to extract specific information on the final states at a given excitation energy. While multiplons composed of an odd number of holes do neither form stable compounds nor well-defined resonances unless a nearest-neighbor density interaction V is added to the Hamiltonian, the doublon and the quadruplon are well-defined resonances. The k-resolved four-hole spectrum at n=2 represents an interesting special case where a completely stable quadruplon turns into a resonance by merging with the doublon-doublon continuum at a critical wave vector. For all fillings with n &gt; 1, the doublon lifetime is strongly k-dependent and is even infinite at the Brillouin zone edges as demonstrated by k-resolved two-hole spectra. This can be traced back to the ""hidden"" charge-SU(2) symmetry of the model which is explicitly broken off half-filling and gives rise to a massive collective excitation, even for arbitrary higher-dimensional but bipartite lattices.",1

We also find that the vigor of the instability in disk-halo systems varies with the shape of the halo velocity ellipsoid. Disks in rigid halos that are massive enough to be stable by the usual criteria, quickly form bars in isotropic halos and much greater halo mass is needed to avoid a strong bar; thus stability criteria derived for disks in rigid halos do not apply when the halo is responsive. The study presented here is of an idealized family of models with near uniform central rotation and that lack an extended halo; we present more realistic models with extended halos in a companion paper. The puzzle presented by the absence of strong bars in some galaxies having gently rising inner rotation curves is compounded by the results presented here.",1

For the standard cylindrical geometry, the existence theory for these solutions, as well as the stability theory of vortices are well developed. The latter is done within the context of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations -- the Gorkov-Eliashberg-Schmid equations of superconductivity -- and the abelian Higgs model of particle physics. We study stability of Abrikosov vortex lattices under finite energy perturbations satisfying a natural parity condition (both defined precisely in the text) for the dynamics given by the Gorkov-Eliashberg-Schmid equations. For magnetic fields close to the second critical magnetic field and for arbitrary lattice shapes, we prove that there exist two functions on the space of lattices, such that Abrikosov vortex lattice solutions are asymptotically stable, provided the superconductor is of Type II and these functions are positive, and unstable, for superconductors of Type I, or if one of these functions is negative.",1
110612,0,"Phase diagrams of disordered Weyl semimetals Weyl semimetals are gapless quasi-topological materials with a set of isolated nodal points forming their Fermi surface. They manifest their quasi-topological character in a series of topological electromagnetic responses including the anomalous Hall effect. Here we study the effect of disorder on Weyl semimetals while monitoring both their nodal/semi-metallic and topological properties through computations of the localization length and the Hall conductivity. We examine three different lattice tight-binding models which realize the Weyl semimetal in part of their phase diagram and look for universal features that are common to all of the models, and interesting distinguishing features of each model. We present detailed phase diagrams of these models for large system sizes and we find that weak disorder preserves the nodal points up to the diffusive limit, but does affect the Hall conductivity. We show that the trend of the Hall conductivity is consistent with an effective picture in which disorder causes the Weyl nodes move within the Brillouin zone along a specific direction that depends deterministically on the properties of the model and the neighboring phases to the Weyl semimetal phase. We also uncover an unusual (non-quantized) anomalous Hall insulator phase which can only exist in the presence of disorder.",1

110904,0,"Is General Relativity a (partial) Return of Aristotelian Physics? Aristotle has split physics at the sphere of the moon; above this sphere there is no change except eternal spherical motion, below are two different kinds of motion: Natural motion (without specific cause) and enforced motion. In modern view motion is caused by gravity and by other forces. The split at the sphere of the moon has been definitely overcome through the observation of a supernova and several comets by Tycho Brahe. The second distinction was eradicated by Isaak Newton who showed that gravitational motion was caused by a force proportional to the inverse square of the distance. By the theory of General Relativity, Albert Einstein showed that there is no gravitational force but motion under gravity (i.e. Aristotles ) is caused by the curved geometry of spacetime.

111232,0,"Spatiotemporal Modeling of Node Temperatures in Supercomputers Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is home to many large supercomputing clusters. These clusters require an enormous amount of power (~500-2000 kW each), and most of this energy is converted into heat. Thus, cooling the components of the supercomputer becomes a critical and expensive endeavor. Recently a project was initiated to optimize the cooling system used to cool one of the rooms housing three of these large clusters and develop a general good-practice procedure for reducing cooling costs and monitoring other machine rooms. This work focuses on the statistical approach used to quantify the effect that several cooling changes to the room had on the temperatures of the individual nodes of the computers. The largest cluster in the room has 1600 nodes that run a variety of jobs during general use. Since extremes temperatures are important, a Normal distribution plus generalized Pareto distribution for the upper tail is used to model the marginal distribution, along with a Gaussian process copula to account for spatio-temporal dependence. A Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model is used to model the spatial and/or temporal effects on the node temperatures as the cooling changes take place. This model is then used to assess the condition of the node temperatures after each change to the room. The analysis approach was used to uncover the cause of a problematic episode of overheating nodes on one of the supercomputing clusters. The next step is to also use the model to estimate the trend in node temperatures due to an increase in supply air temperature and ultimately decide when any further temperature increases would become unsafe. This same process can be applied to reduce the cooling expenses for other data centers as well.",1
111250,0,"The geometric genus and Seiberg-Witten invariant of Newton nondegenerate surface singularities Given a normal surface singularity (X,0), its link, M is a closed differentiable three dimensional manifold which carries much analytic information. It is an interesting question to ask whether, under suitable analytic and topological conditions, the geometric genus (or other analytic invariants) can be recovered from the link. The Casson invariant conjecture predicts that p_g can be identified using the Casson invariant in the case when (X,0) is a complete intersection and M has trivial first homology with integral coefficients. The Seiberg-Witten invariant conjecture predicts that the geometric genus of a Gorenstein singularity, whose link has trivial first homology with rational coefficients, can be calculated as a normalized Seiberg-Witten invariant of the link. The first conjecture is still open, but counterexamples have been found for the second one. We prove here the Seiberg-Witten invariant conjecture for hypersurface singularities given by a function with Newton nondegenerate principal part. We provide a theory of computation sequences and of the way they bound the geometric genus. Newton nondegenerate singularities can be resolved explicitly by Oka's algorithm, and we exploit the combinatorial interplay between the resolution graph and the Newton diagram to show that in each step of the computation sequence we construct, the given bound is sharp. Our method recovers the geometric genus of (X,0) explicitly from the link, assuming that (X,0) is indeed Newton nondegenerate with a rational homology sphere link. Assuming some additional information about the Newton diagram, we recover part of the spectrum, as well as the Poincar\'e series associated with the Newton filtration. Finally, we show that the normalized Seiberg-Witten invariant associated with the canonical spin^c structure on the link coincides with our identification of the geometric genus.",1
111426,0,"Perturbation growth in accreting filaments We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the growth of perturbations in infinitely long, initially sub-critical but accreting filaments. The growth of these perturbations leads to filament fragmentation and the formation of cores. Most previous work on this subject has been confined to the growth and fragmentation of equilibrium filaments and has found that there exists a preferential fragmentation length scale which is roughly 4 times the filament's diameter. Our results show a more complicated dispersion relation with a series of peaks linking perturbation wavelength and growth rate. These are due to gravo-acoustic oscillations along the longitudinal axis during the sub-critical phase of growth. The positions of the peaks in growth rate have a strong dependence on both the mass accretion rate onto the filament and the temperature of the gas. When seeded with a multi-wavelength density power spectrum there exists a clear preferred core separation equal to the largest peak in the dispersion relation. Our results allow one to estimate a minimum age for a filament which is breaking up into regularly spaced fragments, as well as a maximum accretion rate. We apply the model to observations of filaments in Taurus by Tafalla &amp; Hacar (2015) and find accretion rates consistent with those estimated by Palmeirim et al. (2013).",1
111542,0,"Electronic Evidence for Type II Weyl Semimetal State in MoTe2 Topological quantum materials, including topological insulators and superconductors, Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals, have attracted much attention recently for their unique electronic structure, spin texture and physical properties. Very lately, a new type of Weyl semimetals has been proposed where the Weyl Fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter, which is distinct from the standard type I Weyl semimetals with a point-like Fermi surface. The Weyl cone in this type II semimetals is strongly tilted and the related Fermi surface undergos a Lifshitz transition, giving rise to a new kind of chiral anomaly and other new physics. MoTe2 is proposed to be a candidate of a type II Weyl semimetal; the sensitivity of its topological state to lattice constants and correlation also makes it an ideal platform to explore possible topological phase transitions. By performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements with unprecedentedly high resolution, we have uncovered electronic evidence of type II semimetal state in MoTe2. We have established a full picture of the bulk electronic states and surface state for MoTe2 that are consistent with the band structure calculations. A single branch of surface state is identified that connects bulk hole pockets and bulk electron pockets. Detailed temperature-dependent ARPES measurements show high intensity spot-like features that is ~40 meV above the Fermi level and is close to the momentum space consistent with the theoretical expectation of the type II Weyl points. Our results constitute electronic evidence on the nature of the Weyl semimetal state that favors the presence of two sets of type II Weyl points in MoTe2.",1

A stochastic Komatu-Loewner evolution denoted by ${\rm SKLE}_{\alpha,b}$ has been introduced in \cite{CF} as a family $\{F_t\}$ of random growing hulls with $F_t\subset D$ driven by a diffusion process $\xi(t)$ on $\partial {\mathbb H}$ that is determined by certain continuous homogeneous functions $\alpha$ and $b$ defined on the space ${\cal S}$ of all labelled standard slit domains. We aim at identifying the distribution of a suitably reparametrized ${\rm SKLE}_{\alpha,b}$ with that of the Loewner evolution on ${\mathbb H}$ driven by the path of a certain continuous semimartingale and thereby relating the former to the distribution of ${\rm SLE}_{\alpha^2}$ when $\alpha$ is a constant.

We further show that a reparametrized ${\rm SKLE}_{\sqrt{6},-b_{\rm BMD}}$ has the same distribution as ${\rm SLE}_6$, where $b_{\rm BMD}$ is the BMD-domain constant indicating the discrepancy of $D$ from ${\mathbb H}$ relative to Brownian motion with darning (BMD in abbreviation). A key ingredient of the proof is a hitting time analysis for the absorbing Brownian motion on ${\mathbb H}.$ We also revisit and examine the locality property of ${\rm SLE}_6$ in several canonical domains. Finally K-L equations and SKLEs for other canonical multiply connected planar domains than the standard slit one are recalled and examined.",1

As incident a Gaussian laser beam is treated, having its waist a distance from the HL plane and its axis passing through the centre of the HL. It is shown that the SPP introduces a phase singularity of p-th order to the incident beam, while the lens transforms the beam characteristic parameters. The output light beam is analyzed in detail: its characteristic parameters and focusing properties, amplitude and intensity distributions and the vortex rings profiles and radii, at any z distance behind the HL plane, as well as in the near and far field.",1
111604,0,"Statistical mechanics of two-dimensional foams: Physical foundations of the model In a recent series of papers [1--3], a statistical model that accounts for correlations between topological and geometrical properties of a two-dimensional shuffled foam has been proposed and compared with experimental and numerical data. Here, the various assumptions on which the model is based are exposed and justified: the equiprobability hypothesis of the foam configurations is argued. The range of correlations between bubbles is discussed, and the mean field approximation that is used in the model is detailed. The two self-consistency equations associated with this mean field description can be interpreted as the conservation laws of number of sides and bubble curvature, respectively. Finally, the use of a '' Grand-Canonical '' description, in which the foam constitutes a reservoir of sides and curvature, is justified.",1
111617,0,"Imaging superconducting vortex core and lattice with the scanning tunneling microscope The observation of vortices in superconductors was a major breakthrough in developing the conceptual background for superconducting applications. Each vortex carries a flux quantum, and the magnetic field radially decreases from the center. Techniques used to make magnetic field maps, such as magnetic decoration, give vortex lattice images in a variety of systems. However, strong type II superconductors allow penetration of the magnetic field over large distances, of order of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda. Superconductivity survives up to magnetic fields where, for imaging purposes, there is nearly no magnetic contrast. Static and dynamic properties of vortices are largely unknown at such high magnetic fields. Reciprocal space studies using neutron scattering give insight into the collective behavior. But the microscopic details of vortex arrangements and their motion remain difficult to obtain. Direct real space visualization can be made using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Instead of using magnetic contrast, the electronic density of states describes spatial variations of the quasiparticle and pair wavefunction properties. These are of order of the superconducting coherence length \xi, which is much smaller than \lambda. In principle, individual vortices can be imaged using STM up to the upper critical field where vortex cores, of size \xi, overlap. In this review, we describe recent advances in vortex imaging made with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We introduce the technique and discuss vortex images which reveal the influence of the Fermi surface distribution of the superconducting gap on the internal structure of vortices, the collective behavior of the lattice in different materials and conditions, and the observation of vortex lattice melting.",1
111648,0,"The very wide-field $gzK$ galaxy survey -- II. The relationship between star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2$ and their host haloes based upon HOD modelling We present the results of an halo occupation distribution (HOD) analysis of star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2$. We obtained high-quality angular correlation functions based on a large sgzK sample, which enabled us to carry out the HOD analysis. The mean halo mass and the HOD mass parameters are found to increase monotonically with increasing $K$-band magnitude, suggesting that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive dark haloes. The luminosity dependence of the HOD mass parameters was found to be the same as in the local Universe; however, the masses were larger than in the local Universe over all ranges of magnitude. This implies that galaxies at $z \sim 2$ tend to form in more massive dark haloes than in the local Universe, a process known as downsizing. By analysing the dark halo mass evolution using the extended Press--Schechter formalism and the number evolution of satellite galaxies in a dark halo, we find that faint Lyman break galaxies at $z \sim 4$ could evolve into the faintest sgzKs $(22.0 &lt; K \leq 23.0)$ at $z \sim 2$ and into the Milky-Way-like galaxies or elliptical galaxies in the local Universe, whereas the most luminous sgzKs $(18.0 \leq K \leq 21.0)$ could evolve into the most massive systems in the local Universe. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) of the sgzKs was found to be consistent with the prediction of the model, except that the SHMR of the faintest sgzKs was smaller than the prediction at $z \sim 2$. This discrepancy may be attributed that our samples are confined to star-forming galaxies.",1

111718,0,"Single-shot optical imaging through scattering medium using digital in-line holography Non-invasive and single-shot holographic imaging through complex media is technically challenging due to random light scattering which significantly scrambles optical information. Recently, several methods have been presented to address this issue. However, they require complicated measurements of optical transmission matrices, or existing techniques do only retrieve intensity information. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a holographic approach for single-shot imaging through a scattering layer based on digital in-line holography in combination with the autocorrelation of the speckle intensity. Using a simple optical configuration and experimental procedure, the proposed method enables to retrieve the complex amplitude image of an object located at arbitrary planes behind scattering media. The technique has potential applications in biomedical imaging, deep tissue microscopy, and 3D imaging through turbid media.",1

112061,0,"Discrete Scale Relativity And SX Phoenicis Variable Stars Discrete Scale Relativity proposes a new symmetry principle called discrete cosmological self-similarity which relates each class of systems and phenomena on a given Scale of nature's discrete cosmological hierarchy to the equivalent class of analogue systems and phenomena on any other Scale. The new symmetry principle can be understood in terms of discrete scale invariance involving the spatial, temporal and dynamic parameters of all systems and phenomena. This new paradigm predicts a rigorous discrete self-similarity between Stellar Scale variable stars and Atomic Scale excited atoms undergoing energy-level transitions and sub-threshold oscillations. Previously, methods for demonstrating and testing the proposed symmetry principle have been applied to RR Lyrae, Delta Scuti and ZZ Ceti variable stars. In the present paper we apply the same analytical methods and diagnostic tests to a new class of variable stars: SX Phoenicis variables. Double-mode pulsators are shown to provide an especially useful means of testing the uniqueness and rigor of the conceptual principles and discrete self-similar scaling of Discrete Scale Relativity.",1
112095,0,"Study of the charge profile of thermally poled electrets The charge profile of thermally poled electrets has been studied using two different methods, laser induced pressure pulse (LIPP) and pulsed electroacoustic (PEA), to gain insight into the mechanisms that are activated and assess which is the most appropriate method to study the charge profile. Disc--shaped PET samples have been conventionally poled to activate both the alpha and the rho relaxation and, right after, partially discharged up to a temperature Tpd. In this way, samples with a different combination of dipolar and space charge polarization have been obtained. Both LIPP and PEA reveal asymmetric profiles for Tpd below the glass transition temperature, that progressively become antisymmetric for higher temperatures. The shape and evolution of the charge profiles can be explained assuming injection of negative carriers from the anode that enhances the trapping of positive carriers near this electrode. It can be observed that PEA is able to detect a wider variety of polarization mechanisms in the system while LIPP gives a simpler picture of the charge profile.",1

112188,0,"High refractive index immersion liquid for super-resolution 3D imaging using sapphire-based aNAIL optics Optically-transparent immersion liquids with refractive index (n ~ 1.77) to match sapphire-based aplanatic numerical aperture increasing lens (aNAIL) are necessary for achieving deep 3D imaging with high spatial resolution. We report that antimony tribromide (SbBr$_{3}$) salt dissolved in liquid diiodomethane (CH$_{2}$I$_{2}$) provides a new high refractive index immersion liquid for optics applications. The refractive index is tunable from n = 1.74 (pure) to n = 1.873 (saturated), by adjusting either salt concentration or temperature; this allows it to match (or even exceed) the refractive index of sapphire. Importantly, the solution gives excellent light transmittance in the ultraviolet to near-infrared range, an improvement over commercially-available immersion liquids. This refractive index matched immersion liquid formulation has enabled us to develop a sapphire-based aNAIL objective that has both high numerical aperture (NA = 1.17) and long working distance (WD = 12 mm). This opens up new possibilities for deep 3D imaging with high spatial resolution.",1

Such non-conservative ratchet-like structures support rich families of stable vortex solitons in cubic nonlinear media, whose properties depend on the sign of the topological charge due to the nonequivalence of azimuthal directions. In contrast, oppositely charged vortex solitons remain equivalent in similar fully PT-symmetric potentials. The vortex solitons in the pPT- and PT-symmetric potentials are shown to feature qualitatively different internal current distributions, which are described by different discrete rotation symmetries of the intensity profiles.",1

This would eliminate the need for an optical reference oscillator in the scheme of Tsang and Caves [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 123601 (2010)], along with its associated disadvantages. We also show that if one is restricted to position measurements alone then two copies of the same two-oscillator configuration can be used for narrow-band back-action-free force metrology.",1
112918,0,"A technique for constraining the driving scale of turbulence and a modified Chandrasekhar-Fermi method The Chandrasekhar-Fermi method is a powerful technique for estimating the strength of the mean magnetic field projected on the plane of the sky. In this paper, we present a technique for improving the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, in which we take into account the averaging effect arising from independent eddies along the line of sight . In the conventional Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, the strength of fluctuating magnetic field divided by $\sqrt{4 \pi \bar{\rho}}$, where $\bar{\rho}$ is average density, is assumed to be comparable to the line-of-sight velocity dispersion. This however is not true when the driving scale of turbulence $L_f$, i.e. the outer scale of turbulence, is smaller than the size of the system along the line of sight $L_{los}$. In fact, the conventional Chandrasekhar-Fermi method over-estimates the strength of the mean plane-of-the-sky magnetic field by a factor of $\sim \sqrt{ L_{los}/L_f}$. We show that the standard deviation of centroid velocities divided by the average line-of-sight velocity dispersion is a good measure of $\sqrt{ L_{los}/L_f}$, which enables us to propose a modified Chandrasekhar-Fermi method.",1

We find that particle-hole asymmetric pertrubation causes phase-shifts and bit-flips decoherence processes in Majorana qubits. However, these sources of decoherence are negligible in uniform system with spatially separated Majorana zero modes.",1

The predicted instability thresholds are compared with those in similar Yb$^{3+}$-doped fiber amplifiers with 976 nm pump and 1060 nm signal, and are found to be higher, even though the heat load is much higher in Tm-doped amplifiers. The higher threshold in the Tm-doped fiber is attributed to its longer signal wavelength, and to stronger gain saturation, due in part to cross-relaxation heating.",1

113092,0,"Diffuse X-ray emission from star forming galaxies We study the diffuse X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) of star forming galaxies using 2-D axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations and analytical considerations of supernovae (SNe) driven galactic outflows. We find that the mass loading of the outflows, a crucial parameter for determining the X-ray luminosity, is constrained by the availability of gas in the central star forming region, and a competition between cooling and expansion. We show that the allowed range of the mass loading factor can explain the observed scaling of $L_X$ with star formation rate (SFR) as $L_X \propto$ SFR$^2$ for SFR $\gtrsim 1$ M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, and a flatter relation at low SFRs. We also show that the emission from the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) in the halo of massive galaxies can explain the sub-linear behaviour of the $L_X-$SFR relation as well as a large scatter in the diffuse X-ray emission for low SFRs ($\lesssim$ few M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$). Our results point out that galaxies with small SFRs and large diffuse X-ray luminosities are excellent candidates for detection of the elusive CGM.",1
113215,0,"Ion-trap measurements of electric-field noise near surfaces Electric-field noise near surfaces is a common problem in diverse areas of physics, and a limiting factor for many precision measurements. There are multiple mechanisms by which such noise is generated, many of which are poorly understood. Laser-cooled, trapped ions provide one of the most sensitive systems to probe electric-field noise at MHz frequencies and over a distance range 30 - 3000 $\mu$m from the surface. Over recent years numerous experiments have reported spectral densities of electric-field noise inferred from ion heating-rate measurements and several different theoretical explanations for the observed noise characteristics have been proposed. This paper provides an extensive summary and critical review of electric-field noise measurements in ion traps, and compares these experimental findings with known and conjectured mechanisms for the origin of this noise. This reveals that the presence of multiple noise sources, as well as the different scalings added by geometrical considerations, complicate the interpretation of these results. It is thus the purpose of this review to assess which conclusions can be reasonably drawn from the existing data, and which important questions are still open. In so doing it provides a framework for future investigations of surface-noise processes.",1
113234,0,"Radiation Reaction Effect on Laser Driven Auto-Resonant Particle Acceleration The effects of radiation reaction force on laser driven auto-resonant particle acceleration scheme are studied using Landau-Lifshitz equation of motion. These studies are carried out for both linear as well as circularly polarized laser fields in the presence of static axial magnetic field. From the parametric study, a radiation reaction dominated region has been identified in which the particle dynamics is greatly effected by this force. In the radiation reaction dominated region the two significant effects on particle dynamics are seen viz., (1) saturation in energy gain by the initially resonant particle, (2) net energy gain by a initially non-resonant particle which is caused due to resonance broadening. It has been further shown that with the optimum choice of parameters this scheme can be efficiently used to produce electrons with energies in the range of hundreds of TeV. The quantum corrections to the Landu-Lifshitz equation of motion have also been taken into account. The difference in the energy gain estimates of the particle by the quantum corrected and classical Landu-Lifshitz equation are found to be insignificant for the present day as well as upcoming laser facilities.",1

Here we discuss the development of these antibiotics and their method of action. Existing methods for DNA damage visualisation, such as the comet assay and immunofluorescence imaging can often only be analysed qualitatively and this analysis is subjective. We describe a putative single-molecule fluorescence technique for quantifying DNA damage via the total fluorescence intensity of a DNA origami tile fully saturated with an intercalating dye, along with the optical requirements for how to implement these into a light microscopy imaging system capable of single-molecule millisecond timescale imaging. This system promises significant improvements in reproducibility of the quantification of DNA damage over traditional techniques.",1
113421,0,"The Diversity of Growth Histories of Milky Way-mass Galaxies We use the semi-analytic model developed by Henriques et al. (2015) to explore the origin of star formation history diversity for galaxies that lie at the centre of their dark matter haloes and have present-day stellar masses in the range 5-8 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, similar to that of the Milky Way. In this model, quenching is the dominant physical mechanism for introducing scatter in the growth histories of these galaxies. We find that present-day quiescent galaxies have a larger variety of growth histories than star-formers since they underwent 'staggered quenching' - a term describing the correlation between the time of quenching and present-day halo mass. While halo mass correlates broadly with quiescence, we find that quiescence is primarily a function of black hole mass, where galaxies quench when heating from their active galactic nuclei becomes sufficient to offset the redshift-dependent cooling rate. In this model, the emergence of a prominent quiescent population is the main process that flattens the stellar mass-halo mass relation at mass scales at or above that of the Milky Way.",1
113503,0,"Product Formulae for Ozsvath-Szabo 4-manifold Invariants We give formulae for the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of 4-manifolds X obtained by fiber sum of two manifolds M_1, M_2 along surfaces S_1, S_2 having trivial normal bundle and genus g&gt;0. The formulae follow from a general theorem on the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of the result of gluing two 4-manifolds along a common boundary, which is phrased in terms of relative invariants of the pieces. These relative invariants take values in a version of Heegaard Floer homology with coefficients in modules over certain Novikov rings; the fiber sum formula follows from the theorem that this ""perturbed"" version of Heegaard Floer theory recovers the usual Ozsvath-Szabo invariants, when the 4-manifold in question has b^+&gt;1. The construction allows an extension of the definition of the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants to 4-manifolds having b^+ = 1 depending on certain choices, in close analogy with Seiberg-Witten theory. The product formulae lead quickly to calculations of the Ozsvath-Szabo invariants of various 4-manifolds; in all cases the results are in accord with the conjectured equivalence between the Ozsvath-Szabo and Seiberg-Witten invariants.",1

In the matrix-valued case, i.e., if the electron spin is taken into account, it is given by a series of operator-valued time-ordered integrals, whose integrands are factorized into annihilation, preservation, creation, and scalar parts. The Feynman-Kac formula implied by these results is new in the matrix-valued case. Furthermore, we discuss stochastic differential equations and Feynman-Kac representations for an operator-valued integral kernel of the semi-group. As a byproduct we obtain analogous results for Nelson's model.",1
113586,0,"Modeling GD-1 Gaps in a Milky-Way Potential The GD-1 star stream is currently the best available for identifying density fluctuations, ""gaps"", along its length as a test of the LCDM prediction of large numbers of dark matter sub-halos orbiting in the halo. Density variations of some form are present, since the variance of the density along the stream is three times that expected from the empirically estimated variation in the filtered mean star counts. The density variations are characterized with filters that approximate the shape of sub-halo gravitationally induced stream gaps. The filters locate gaps and measures their amplitude, leading to a measurement of the distribution of gap widths. To gain understanding of the factors influencing the gap width distribution, a suite of collisionless n-body simulations for a GD-1 like orbit in a Milky Way-like potential provides a dynamically realistic statistical prediction of the gap distribution. The simulations show that every location in the stream has been disturbed to some degree by a sub-halo. The small gaps found via the filtering are largely noise. Larger gaps, those longer than 1 kpc, or 10 degrees for GD-1, are the source of the excess variance. The suite of stream simulations shows that sub-halos at the predicted inner halo abundance or possibly somewhat higher can produce the required large sale density variations.",1
113605,0,"The young centre of the Earth We treat, as an illustrative example of gravitational time dilation in relativity, the observation that the center of the Earth is younger than the surface by an appreciable amount. Richard Feynman first made this insightful point and presented an estimate of the size of the effect in a talk; a transcription was later published in which the time difference is quoted as 'one or two days'. However, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the result is in fact a few years. In this paper we present this estimate alongside a more elaborate analysis yielding a difference of two and a half years. The aim is to provide a fairly complete solution to the relativity of the 'aging' of an object due to differences in the gravitational potential. This solution - accessible at the undergraduate level - can be used for educational purposes, as an example in the classroom. Finally, we also briefly discuss why exchanging 'years' for 'days' - which in retrospect is a quite simple, but significant, mistake - has been repeated seemingly uncritically, albeit in a few cases only. The pedagogical value of this discussion is to show students that any number or observation, no matter who brought it forward, must be critically examined.",1

113842,0,"Tracing black hole accretion with SED decomposition and IR lines: from local galaxies to the high-z Universe We present new estimates of AGN accretion and star-formation luminosity in galaxies obtained for the local 12-$\mu$m sample of Seyfert galaxies (12MGS), by performing a detailed broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition including the emission of stars, dust heated by star formation and a possible AGN dusty torus. Thanks to the availability of data from the X-rays to the sub-millimetre, we constrain and test the contribution of the stellar, AGN and star-formation components to the SEDs. The availability of Spitzer-IRS low resolution mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra is crucial to constrain the dusty torus component at its peak wavelengths. The results of SED-fitting are also tested against the available information in other bands: the reconstructed AGN bolometric luminosity is compared to those derived from X-rays and from the high excitation IR lines tracing AGN activity like [Ne V] and [O IV]. The IR luminosity due to star-formation (SF) and the intrinsic AGN bolometric luminosity are shown to be strongly related to the IR line luminosity. Variations of these relations with different AGN fractions are investigated, showing that the relation dispersions are mainly due to different AGN relative contribution within the galaxy. Extrapolating these local relations between line and SF or AGN luminosities to higher redshifts, by means of recent Herschel galaxy evolution results, we then obtain mid- and far-IR line luminosity functions useful to estimate how many star-forming galaxies and AGN we expect to detect in the different lines at different redshifts and luminosities with future IR facilities (e.g., JWST, SPICA).",1

Finally, our methods show that, with appropriate scaling of space, time and the density of obstacles, the trajectory of the particle converges to a diffusion with explicitly given parameters.",1
113876,0,"Discrete photon statistics from continuous microwave measurements Photocount statistics are an important tool for the characterization of electromagnetic fields, especially for fields with an irrelevant phase. In the microwave domain, continuous rather than discrete measurements are the norm. Using a novel approach, we recover discrete photon statistics from the cumulants of a continuous distribution of field quadrature measurements. The use of cumulants allows the separation between the signal of interest and experimental noise. Using a parametric amplifier as the first stage of the amplification chain, we extract useful data from up to the sixth cumulant of the continuous distribution of a coherent field, hence recovering up to the third moment of the discrete statistics associated with a signal with much less than one average photon.",1
114064,0,"Nonequilibrium behaviors of 3D Heisenberg model in the Swendsen-Wang algorithm Recently Y. N. showed that the nonequilibrium critical relaxation of the 2D Ising model from the perfectly-ordered state in the Wolff algorithm is described by the stretched-exponential decay, and found a universal scaling scheme to connect nonequilibrium and equilibrium behaviors. In the present study we extend these findings to vector spin models, and the 3D Heisenberg model could be a typical example. In order to evaluate the critical temperature and critical exponents precisely with the above scaling scheme, we calculate the nonequilibrium ordering from the perfectly-disordered state in the Swendsen-Wamg algorithm, and find that the critical ordering process is described by the stretched-exponential growth with the comparable exponent to that of the 3D XY model. The critical exponents evaluated in the present study are consistent with those in previous studies.",1
114065,0,"Application of K-integrals to radiative transfer in layered media Simple yet accurate results for radiative transfer in layered media with discontinuous refractive index are obtained by the method of K-integrals, originally developed for neutron transport analysis. These are certain weighted integrals applied to the angular intensity distribution at the refracting boundaries. The radiative intensity is expressed as the sum of the asymptotic angular intensity distribution valid in the depth of the scattering medium and a transient term valid near the boundary. Integral boundary conditions are obtained from the vanishing of the K-integrals of the boundary transient, yielding simple linear equations for the intensity coefficients (two for a halfspace, four for a slab or an interface), enabling the angular emission intensity and the diffuse reflectance (albedo) and transmittance of the scattering layer to be calculated. The K-integral method is orders of magnitude more accurate than diffusion theory and can be applied to scattering media with a wide range of scattering albedoes. For example, near five figure accuracy is obtained for the diffuse reflectance of scattering layers of refractive index n = 1.5 with single scattering albedo in the range 0.3 to 1",1

The usage of the method was demonstrated with the pseudomorphic HEMT as a specimen. The optimal HEMT dc regime, from the point of view of the ""back action"" problem, was found to belong to the unsaturated area of the static characteristics possibly corresponding to the ballistic electron transport mode. The proposed method is believed to be a convenient tool to explore the ballistic transport, electron diffusion, 2DEG properties and other electrophysical processes in the heterostructures.",1
114111,0,"On the moduli space of Donaldson-Thomas instantons In alignment with a programme by Donaldson and Thomas [DT], Thomas [Th] constructed a deformation invariant for smooth projective Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is now called the Donaldson-Thomas invariant, from the moduli space of (semi-)stable sheaves by using algebraic geometry techniques. In the same paper [Th], Thomas noted that certain perturbed Hermitian-Einstein equations might possibly produce an analytic theory of the invariant. This article sets up the equations on symplectic 6-manifolds, and gives the local model and structures of the moduli space coming from the equations. We then describe a Hitchin-Kobayashi style correspondence for the equations on compact K\""ahler threefolds, which turns out to be a special case of results by Alvarez-Consul and Garcia-Prada [AG].",1

We find that the expectation values of local observables in the stationary state are described better by the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) than by the canonical ensemble. We also find that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis fails for the entire spectrum, but holds true within each symmetry sector, which justifies the GGE. In contrast, if the model has only one global Z2 symmetry or a size-independent number of local Z2 symmetries, we find that the stationary state is described by the canonical ensemble. Thus, the GGE is necessary to describe the stationary state even in a nonintegrable system if it has an extensive number of local symmetries.",1
114228,0,"Highly Catalytic Nanodots with Renal Clearance for Radiation Protection Ionizing radiation (gamma and x-ray) is widely used in industry and medicine, but it can also pose a significant hazardous effect on health and induce cancer, physical deformity and even death, due to DNA damages and invasion of free radicals. There is therefore an urgent unmet demand in designing highly efficient radioprotectants with synergetic integration of effective renal clearance and low toxicity. In this study, we designed ultrasmall (sub-5 nm) highly catalytically active and cysteine-protected MoS2 dots as radioprotectants and investigated their application in protection against ionizing radiation. In vivo preclinical studies showed that the surviving fraction of MoS2-treated mice can appreciably increase to up to 79 % when they were exposed to high-energy ionizing radiation. Furthermore, MoS2 dots can contribute in cleaning up the accumulated free radicals within the body, repairing DNA damages and recovering all vital chemical and biochemical indicators, suggesting their unique role as free radical scavengers. MoS2 dots showed rapid and efficient urinary excretion with more than 80 % injected dose (I.D.) eliminated from the body after 24 hours due to their ultrasmall hydrodynamic size and did not cause any noticeable toxic responses up to 30 days.",1
114539,0,"Optical focusing inside scattering media with time-reversed ultrasound microbubble encoded (TRUME) light Focusing light inside scattering media in a freely addressable fashion is challenging, as the wavefront of the scattered light is highly disordered. Recently developed ultrasound-guided wavefront shaping methods are addressing this challenge, albeit with relatively low modulation efficiency and resolution limitations. In this paper, we present a new technique, time-reversed ultrasound microbubble encoded (TRUME) optical focusing, which is able to focus light with improved efficiency and sub-ultrasound wavelength resolution. This method ultrasonically destructs microbubbles, and measures the wavefront change to compute and render a suitable time-reversed wavefront solution for focusing. We demonstrate that the TRUME technique can create an optical focus at the site of bubble destruction with a size of ~2 microns. Due to the nonlinear pressure-to-destruction response, the TRUME technique can break the addressable focus resolution barrier imposed by the ultrasound focus. We experimentally demonstrate a 2-fold addressable focus resolution improvement in a microbubble aggregate target.",1
114683,0,"The Stellar Mass Fundamental Plane and Compact Quiescent Galaxies at z &lt; 0.6 We examine the evolution of the relation between stellar mass surface density, velocity dispersion and half-light radius$-$the stellar mass fundamental plane$-$for quiescent galaxies at $z&lt;0.6$. We measure the local relation from galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the intermediate redshift relation from $\sim500$ quiescent galaxies with stellar masses $10 \lesssim \mathrm{log}(M_\ast/M_\odot) \lesssim 11.5$. Nearly half of the quiescent galaxies in our intermediate redshift sample are compact. After accounting for important selection and systematic effects, the velocity dispersion distribution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts is similar to galaxies in the local universe. Galaxies at $z&lt;0.6$ appear to be smaller ($\lesssim0.1$ dex) than galaxies in the local sample. The orientation of the stellar mass fundamental plane is independent of redshift for massive quiescent galaxies at $z&lt;0.6$ and the zero-point evolves by $\sim 0.04$ dex. Compact quiescent galaxies fall on the same relation as the extended objects. We confirm that compact quiescent galaxies are the tail of the size and mass distribution of the normal quiescent galaxy population.",1
114719,0,"Web-based description of the space radiation environment using the Bethe-Bloch model Space weather is a rapidly growing area not only in scientific and engineering applications but also in physics education and in the interest of the public. We focus especially on space radiation and its impact on space exploration. The topic is highly interdisciplinary bringing together fundamental concepts of nuclear physics with aspects of radiation protection and space science. We present a new approach to presenting the topic by developing a web-based tool that combines some of the fundamental concepts from these two fields in a single tool that can be developed in the context of advanced secondary or undergraduate university education. We present DREADCode, an outreach or teaching tool to asses rapidly the current conditions of the radiation field in space. DREADCode uses the available data feeds from a number of ongoing space missions to produce a first order approximation of the dose an astronaut would receive during a mission of exploration in deep space. DREADcode is based on a intuitive GUI interface available online from the European Space Weather Portal. The core of the radiation transport computation to produce the radiation dose from the observed fluence of radiation observed by the spacecraft fleet considered is based on a relatively simple approximation: the Bethe-Block equation. DREADCode assumes also a simplified geometry and material configuration for the shields used to compute the dose. The approach is approximate and it sacrifices some important physics on the altar of a rapid execution time allowing a real time operation scenario. There is no intention here to produce an operational tool for use in the space science and engineering. Rather we present an educational tool at undergraduate level that uses modern web-based and programming methods to learn some of the most important concepts in the application of radiation protection to space weather problems.",1
114735,0,"Hydraulic effects in a radiative atmosphere with ionization In a paper of 1978, Eugene Parker postulated the need for hydraulic downward motion to explain magnetic flux concentrations at the solar surface. A similar process has recently also been seen in simplified (e.g., isothermal) models of flux concentrations from the negative effective magnetic pressure instability. We study the effects of partial ionization near the radiative surface on the formation of such magnetic flux concentrations. We first obtain one-dimensional (1D) equilibrium solutions using either a Kramers-like opacity or the ${\rm H}^{-}$ opacity. The resulting atmospheres are then used as initial conditions in two-dimensional (2D) models where flows are driven by an imposed gradient force resembling a localized negative pressure in the form of a blob. To isolate the effects of partial ionization and radiation, we ignore turbulence and convection. In 1D models, due to partial ionization, an unstable stratification forms always near the surface. We show that the extrema in the specific entropy profiles correspond to the extrema in degree of ionization. In the 2D models without partial ionization, flux concentrations form close to the height where the blob is placed. In models with partial ionization, such flux concentrations form at the surface much above the blob. This is due to the corresponding unstable layer in specific entropy. With ${\rm H}^{-}$ opacity, flux concentrations are weaker due to the stably stratified deeper parts. We demonstrate that, together with density stratification, the imposed source of negative pressure drives the formation of flux concentrations. We find that the inclusion of partial ionization affects entropy profiles causing the strong flux concentrations to form closer to the surface. We speculate that turbulence is needed to limit the strength of flux concentrations and homogenize the specific entropy to a more nearly marginal stratification.",1
114843,0,"Granular Superconductor in a honeycomb lattice as a realization of Bosonic Dirac Material We examine the low energy effective theory of phase oscillations in a two-dimensional granular superconducting sheet where the grains are arranged in honeycomb lattice structure. Using the example of graphene we present the evidence for the engineered Dirac nodes in the bosonic excitations: the spectra of the collective bosonic modes cross at the K and K points in the Brillouin zone and form Dirac nodes. We show how two different types of collective phase oscillations are obtained and that they are analogous to the Leggett and the Bogoliubov-Anderson-Gorkov modes in a two-band superconductor. We show that the Dirac node is preserved in the presence of an inter-grain interaction, despite induced changes of the qualitative features of the two collective modes. Finally, breaking the sublattice symmetry by choosing different on-site potentials for the two sublattices leads to a gap opening near the Dirac node, in analogy with Fermionic Dirac materials. Dirac node dispersion of bosonic excitations is thus expanding the discussion of the conventional Dirac cone excitations to the case of bosons. We call this case as a representative of Bosonic Dirac Materials (BDM), similar to the case of Fermionic Dirac materials extensively discussed in the literature.",1
114893,0,"Non-relativistic quantum theory consistent with principle of locality Principle of locality means that any local change (perturbation) of the stationary state wave function field propagates with finite speed, and therefore reaches distant regions of the field with time delay. If a one-particle or multi-particle non-relativistic quantum system is initially in a stationary state, and its wave function field is locally perturbed, then perturbed and non-perturbed sub-regions appear in the region. According to Schr\""odinger equation, borders of the perturbed sub-region propagate with infinite speed, and the perturbation instantaneously affects all infinite region. It means that Schr\""odinger equation predicts infinite speed of the wave function perturbations propagation. This feature of classical Schr\""odinger equation is traditionally interpreted as non-locality of quantum mechanics. From physical point of view, such mathematical behavior of Schr\""odinger equation solutions is questionable because it is difficult to accept that in real world infinite physical objects can instantaneously appear. We introduce a hypothesis that in reality speed of propagation of the perturbed sub-region borders is equal speed of light. On this basis we develop and analyze a finite propagation speed concept for non-relativistic quantum equations. It leads to local interpretation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics consistent with principle of locality and free of local hidden variables. The theory is applied to analysis of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, entanglement and properties of perturbed matter waves. We proved that formulated theory agrees with results of classical experiments on electron matter waves diffraction.",1

However, the use of visible light for optogenetic stimulation is invasive due to low penetration depth and tissue damage owing to larger absorption and scattering. Here, we report, for the first time, in-depth non-scanning fiber-optic two-photon optogenetic stimulation (FO-TPOS) of neurons in-vivo in transgenic mouse models. In order to optimize the deep-brain stimulation strategy, we characterized two-photon activation efficacy at different nearinfrared laser parameters. The significantly-enhanced in-depth stimulation efficiency of FO-TPOS as compared to conventional single-photon beam was demonstrated both by experiments and Monte Carlo simulation. The non-scanning FO-TPOS technology will lead to better understanding of the in-vivo neural circuitry because this technology permits more precise and less invasive anatomical delivery of stimulation.",1
115067,0,"Numerical models for AC loss calculation in large-scale applications of HTS coated conductors Numerical models are powerful tools to predict the electromagnetic behavior of superconductors. In recent years, a variety of models have been successfully developed to simulate high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) coated conductor tapes. While the models work well for the simulation of individual tapes or relatively small assemblies, their direct applicability to devices involving hundreds or thousands of tapes, as for example coils used in electrical machines, is questionable. Indeed the simulation time and memory requirement can quickly become prohibitive. In this article, we develop and compare two different models for simulating realistic HTS devices composed of a large number of tapes: 1) the homogenized model simulates the coil using an equivalent anisotropic homogeneous bulk with specifically developed current constraints to account for the fact that each turn carries the same current; 2) the multi-scale model parallelizes and reduces the computational problem by simulating only several individual tapes at significant positions of the coil's cross-section using appropriate boundary conditions to account for the field generated by the neighboring turns. Both methods are used to simulate a coil made of 2000 tapes, and compared against the widely used H-formulation finite element model that includes all the tapes. Both approaches allow speeding-up simulations of large number of HTS tapes by 1-3 orders of magnitudes, while keeping a good accuracy of the results. Such models could be used to design and optimize large-scale HTS devices.",1

It is assumed that given particles are under conditions of the high vacuum and forces acting on these particles are not dissipative. Such wells may be created by means of an electromagnetic field (in particular radiation) with a fixed spatial distribution but with a nondecreasing strength in time. Trapping and localization of particles in such electromagnetic traps are analyzed on example of typical laser beams. Obtained results may be used in high resolution spectroscopy of various particles (including also atoms and molecules in definite cases).,1

The transport level is reduced as the particle energy increase; the widths of the guiding center islands produced by the passing particles are inverse proportional to the square root of parallel velocities.

115707,0,"The relative wavelength independence of IR lags in active galactic nuclei: implications for the distribution of the hot dust We show that, contrary to simple predictions, most AGNs show at best only a small increase of lags in the J, H, K, and L bands with increasing wavelength. We suggest that a possible cause of this near simultaneity of the variability from the near-IR to the mid-IR is that the hot dust is in a hollow bi-conical outflow of which we only see the near side. Although most AGNs show near simultaneity of IR variability, there was at least one epoch when NGC 4151 showed the sharply increasing IR lag with the increase of the wavelength. This behaviour might also be present in GQ Comae. We discuss these results briefly. The relative wavelength independence of IR lags simplifies the use of IR lags for estimating cosmological parameters.",1

We first show that the required model Hamiltonian of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with an effective magnetic field and tunable parameters can be realized in this system. For dynamical response to ramping the external fields, the quantized plateaus emerge in the Berry curvature of the interacting atomic spin chain as a function of the effective spin-exchange interaction. The quantization of this response in the parameter space with the interaction-induced topological transition characterizes the many-body dynamical quantum Hall effect.

Several works proposed to understand this as a signature for edge theory properties changing with energy scale.

By adding a DC current and an RF pump tone we are able to generate parametric amplification using three-wave mixing. The devices exhibit gain of more than 15 dB across an instantaneous bandwidth from 4 to 8 GHz. The total usable gain bandwidth, including both sides of the signal-idler gain region, is more than 6 GHz. The noise referred to the input of the devices approaches the quantum limit, with less than 1 photon excess noise. Compared to similarly constructed four-wave mixing amplifiers, these devices operate with the RF pump at $\sim$20 dB lower power and at frequencies far from the signal.

116060,0,"Degeneracy between Lensing and Occultation in the Analysis of Self-lensing Phenomena More than 40 years after the first discussion, it was recently reported the detection of a self-lensing phenomenon within a binary system where the brightness of a background star is magnified by its foreground companion. It is expected that the number of self-lensing binary detections will be increased in a wealth of data from current and future survey experiments. In this paper, we introduce a degeneracy in the interpretation of self-lensing light curves. The degeneracy is intrinsic to self-lensing binaries for which both magnification by lensing and de-magnification by occultation occur simultaneously and is caused by the difficulty in separating the contribution of the lensing-induced magnification from the observed light curve. We demonstrate the severity of the degeneracy by presenting example self-lensing light curves suffering from the degeneracy. We also present the relation between the lensing parameters of the degenerate solutions. The degeneracy would pose as an important obstacle in accurately determine self-lensing parameters and thus to characterize binaries.",1

The physical interpretation of rapidities going back to Sutherland is that they are the asymptotic momenta after letting a quantum gas expand into a larger volume making it dilute and noninteracting. We exploit this picture to make a direct connection to quantities that are accessible in sudden-expansion experiments with ultracold quantum gases. By a direct comparison of Bethe-ansatz and time-dependent density matrix renormalization group results, we demonstrate that the expansion velocity of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model can be predicted from knowing the distribution of occupied rapidities defined by the initial state. Curiously, an approximate Bethe-ansatz solution works well also for the Bose-Hubbard model.",1

This approach goes beyond the adiabatic approximation usually used in linear-response TDDFT and aims at improving the accuracy of calculations of electronic excitation energies of molecular systems. A detailed derivation of the frequency-dependent second-order Bethe-Salpeter correlation kernel is given using many-body Green-function theory. Preliminary tests of this range-separated TDDFT method are presented for the calculation of excitation energies of the He and Be atoms and small molecules (H2, N2, CO2, H2CO, and C2H4).

Our SNS weak link consists of high-quality sputtered Nb electrodes that are contacted with evaporated Cu. The two-step fabrication flow enables great flexibility in the choice of materials and pattern design. A comparison of the temperature-dependent equilibrium critical supercurrent with theoretical predictions indicates that the quality of the Nb-Cu interface is similar to that of evaporated Al-Cu weak links. Aiming at increased sensitivity, range of operation temperatures, and thermal isolation, we investigate how these SNS structures can be combined with shadow-evaporated aluminum tunnel junctions for sensor applications that utilize the superconducting proximity effect.

116457,0,"Solar models with new low-metal abundances In the last decade, the photospheric abundances of the Sun had been revised several times by many observers. The standard solar models (SSM) constructed with the new low-metal abundances disagree with helioseismic results and detected neutrino fluxes. The solar model problem has been puzzled some stellar physicists for more than ten years. Rotation, enhanced diffusion, convection overshoot, and magnetic fields are used to reconcile the new abundances with helioseismology. The \textbf{too} low-helium \textbf{subsurface abundance} in enhanced diffusion models can be improved by the mixing caused by rotation and magnetic fields. The problem of the depth of the convective zone in rotating models can be resolved by convection overshoot. Consequently the Asplund-Grevesse-Sauval rotation model including overshooting (AGSR) reproduces the seismically inferred sound-speed and density profiles, and the convection zone depth as well as the Grevesse and Sauval (GS98) model computed before. But this model fails to reproduce the surface helium abundance which is 0.2393 ($2.6$ $\sigma$ away from the seismic value) and neutrino fluxes. The magnetic model called AGSM keeps the agreement of the AGSR and improves the prediction of the surface helium abundance. The observed separation ratios $r_{02}$ and $r_{13}$ are reasonably reproduced by AGSM. Moreover, neutrino fluxes calculated by this model are not far from the detected neutrino fluxes and the predictions of previous works.",1

It is first shown that a uniform maximally aligned completely separable eigenstate can exist just for fields ${h}_s$ parallel to a principal plane and forming four straight lines in field space, with the alignment direction different from that of ${h}_s$ and determined by the anisotropy. Such state always becomes a non-degenerate ground state (GS) for sufficiently strong (yet finite) fields along these lines, in both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) type systems. In AFM chains, this field coexists with the non-transverse factorizing field ${h}'_s$ associated with a degenerate N\'eel-type separable GS, which is shown to arise at a level crossing in a finite chain. It is also demonstrated for arbitrary spin that pairwise entanglement reaches full range in the vicinity of both ${h}_s$ and ${h}'_s$, vanishing at ${h}_s$ but approaching small yet finite side-limits at ${h}'_s$, which are analytically determined.

However, by cutting the topological insulator into ribbons, the symmetry of the system is reduced. By constructing effective Hamiltonians containing the proper symmetry of the ribbon, we find that the nature of topological states is dependent on the reduced symmetry of the ribbon and the appropriate boundary conditions. We apply our model to the recently discovered two-dimensional topological crystalline insulators composed by IV-VI monolayers, where we verify that the edge terminations play a major role on the Dirac crossings. Particularly, we find that some bulk cuts lead to nonsymmorphic ribbons, even though the bulk material is symmorphic.

116757,0,"Locally Causal and Deterministic Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics: Parallel Lives and Cosmic Inflation Several locally deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics are presented and reviewed. The fundamental differences between these interpretations are made transparent by explicitly showing what information is carried locally by each physical system in an idealized experimental test of Bell's theorem. This also shows how each of these models can be locally causal and deterministic. First, a model is presented which avoids Bell's arguments through the assumption that space-time inflated from an initial singularity, which encapsulates the entire past light cone of every event in the universe. From this assumption, it is shown how quantum mechanics can produce locally consistent reality by choosing one of many possible futures at the time of the singularity. Secondly, we review and expand the Parallel Lives interpretation of Brassard and Raymond-Robichaud, which maintains local causality and determinism by abandoning the strictest notion of realism.

116844,0,"Deautonomisation by singularity confinement: an algebro-geometric justification The `deautonomisation' of an integrable mapping of the plane consists in treating the free parameters in the mapping as functions of the independent variable, the precise expressions of which are to be determined with the help of a suitable criterion for integrability. Standard practice is to use the singularity confinement criterion and to require that singularities be confined at the very first opportunity. An algebro-geometrical analysis will show that confinement at a later stage invariably leads to a nonintegrable deautonomized system, thus justifying the standard singularity confinement approach. In particular, it will be shown on some selected examples of discrete Painleve equations, how their regularisation through blow-up yields exactly the same conditions on the parameters in the mapping as the singularity confinement criterion. Moreover, for all these examples, it will be shown that the conditions on the parameters are in fact equivalent to a linear transformation on part of the Picard group, obtained from the blow-up.",1
116948,0,"Electric quadrupole interaction in cubic BCC alpha-Fe Moessbauer transmission spectra for the 14.41-keV resonant line in 57Fe have been collected at room temperature by using 57Co(Rh) commercial source and alpha-Fe strain-free single crystal as an absorber. The absorber was magnetized to saturation in the absorber plane perpendicular to the gamma-ray beam axis applying small external magnetic field. Spectra were collected for various orientations of the magnetizing field, the latter lying close to the [110] crystal plane. A positive electric quadrupole coupling constant was found practically independent on the field orientation. One obtains the following value Vzz=+1.61(4)x10^19 V/m^2 for the (average) principal component of the electric field gradient (EFG) tensor under assumption that the EFG tensor is axially symmetric and the principal axis is aligned with the magnetic hyperfine field acting on the 57Fe nucleus. The nuclear spectroscopic electric quadrupole moment for the first excited state of the 57Fe nucleus was adopted as +0.17 b. Similar measurement was performed at room temperature using as-rolled polycrystalline alpha-Fe foil of high purity in the zero external field. Corresponding value for the principal component of the EFG was found as Vzz=+1.92(4)x10^19 V/m^2. Hence, it seems that the origin of the EFG is primarily due to the local (atomic) electronic wave function distortion caused by the spin-orbit interaction between effective electronic spin S and incompletely quenched electronic angular momentum L. It seems as well that the lowest order term proportional to the product L.LAMBDA.S dominates, as no direction dependence of the EFG principal component is seen. The lowest order term is isotropic for a cubic symmetry as one has LAMBDA=lambda.1 for cubic systems with the symbol 1 denoting unit operator and lambda being the coupling parameter.",1
116951,0,Dipole density instead of potentials in electrocardiology We discuss the forward and inverse problems between the potential V(x) measured in a heart chamber and its sources represented by a dipole density d(y) located on the heart wall. We show that the mapping from d(y) to V(x) is a compact integral operator. Its inverse is unbounded which makes the inverse problem ill-posed in the mathematical sense. We investigate methods to solve the inverse problem approximately in view of the mapping of complicated cardiac arrhythmias. We point out an analogy between phase mapping and 2-dimensional hydrodynamics.,1
116958,0,"Validity of the ICFT R-matrix method: Be-like Al$^{9+}$ a case study We have carried-out 98-level configuration-interaction / close-coupling (CI/CC) intermediate coupling frame transformation (ICFT) and Breit-Pauli R-matrix calculations for the electron-impact excitation of Be-like Al$^{9+}$. The close agreement that we find between the two sets of effective collision strengths demonstrates the continued robustness of the ICFT method. On the other hand, a comparison of this data with previous 238-level CI/CC ICFT effective collision strengths shows that the results for excitation up to n=4 levels are systematically and increasingly underestimated over a wide range of temperatures by R-matrix calculations whose close-coupling expansion extends only to n=4 (98-levels). Thus, we find to be false a recent conjecture that the ICFT approach may not be completely robust. The conjecture was based upon a comparison of 98-level CI/CC Dirac R-matrix effective collision strengths for Al$^{9+}$ with those from the 238-level CI/CC ICFT R-matrix calculations. The disagreement found recently is due to a lack of convergence of the close-coupling expansion in the 98-level CI/CC Dirac work. The earlier 238-level CI/CC ICFT work has a superior target to the 98-level CI/CC Dirac one and provides more accurate atomic data. Similar considerations need to be made for other Be-like ions and for other sequences.",1

116970,0,"Was the nineteenth century giant eruption of Eta Carinae a merger event in a triple system? We discuss the events that led to the giant eruption of Eta Carinae, and find that the mid-nineteenth century (in 1838-1843) giant mass-loss outburst has the characteristics of being produced by the merger event of a massive close binary, triggered by the gravitational interaction with a massive third companion star, which is the current binary companion in the Eta Carinae system. We come to this conclusion by a combination of theoretical arguments supported by computer simulations using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment. According to this model the $\sim 90$\,\MSun\, present primary star of the highly eccentric Eta Carinae binary system is the product of this merger, and its $\sim 30$\,\MSun\, companion originally was the third star in the system. In our model the Homunculus nebula was produced by an extremely enhanced stellar wind, energized by tidal energy dissipation prior to the merger, which enormously boosted the radiation-driven wind mass-loss. The current orbital plane is then aligned with the equatorial plane of the Homunculus, and the symmetric lobes are roughly aligned with the argument of periastron of the current Eta Carina binary. The merger itself then occurred in 1838, which resulted in a massive asymmetric outflow in the equatorial plane of the Homunculus. The 1843 outburst can in our model be attributed to the subsequent encounter when the companion star (once the outer most star in the triple system) plunges through the bloated envelope of the merger product, once when it passed periastron again. We predict that the system has an excess space velocity of order 50\,km/s in the equatorial plane of the Homunculus. Our triple model gives a viable explanation for the high runaway velocities typically observed in LBVs \citep{2015MNRAS.447..598S}.",1
117021,0,"The diverse evolutionary paths of simulated high-z massive, compact galaxies to z=0 Massive quiescent galaxies have much smaller physical sizes at high redshift than today. The strong evolution of galaxy size may be caused by progenitor bias, major and minor mergers, adiabatic expansion, and/or renewed star formation, but it is difficult to test these theories observationally. Herein, we select a sample of 35 massive, compact galaxies ($M_* = 1-3 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, $M_*/R^{1.5} &gt; 10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$/kpc$^{1.5}$) at $z=2$ in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Illustris and trace them forward to $z=0$ to uncover their evolution and identify their descendants. By $z=0$, the original factor of 3 difference in stellar mass spreads to a factor of 20. The dark matter halo masses similarly spread from a factor of 5 to 40. The galaxies' evolutionary paths are diverse: about half acquire an ex-situ envelope and are the core of a more massive descendant, a third survive undisturbed and gain very little mass, 15% are consumed in a merger with a more massive galaxy, and a small remainder are thoroughly mixed by major mergers. The galaxies grow in size as well as mass, and only $\sim$10% remain compact by $z=0$. The majority of the size growth is driven by the acquisition of ex-situ mass. The most massive galaxies at $z=0$ are the most likely to have compact progenitors, but this trend possesses significant dispersion which precludes a direct linkage to compact galaxies at $z=2$. The compact galaxies' merger rates are influenced by their $z=2$ environments, so that isolated or satellite compact galaxies (which are protected from mergers) are the most likely to survive to the present day.",1
117027,0,"Correlation of hard X-ray and white light emission in solar flares A statistical study of the correlation between hard X-ray and white light emission in solar flares is performed in order to search for a link between flare-accelerated electrons and white light formation. We analyze 43 flares spanning GOES classes M and X using observations from RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) and HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager). We calculate X-ray fluxes at 30 keV and white light fluxes at 6173 \r{A} summed over the hard X-ray flare ribbons with an integration time of 45 seconds around the peak hard-X ray time. We find a good correlation between hard X-ray fluxes and excess white light fluxes, with a highest correlation coefficient of 0.68 for photons with energy of 30 keV. Assuming the thick target model, a similar correlation is found between the deposited power by flare-accelerated electrons and the white light fluxes. The correlation coefficient is found to be largest for energy deposition by electrons above ~50 keV. At higher electron energies the correlation decreases gradually while a rapid decrease is seen if the energy provided by low-energy electrons is added. This suggests that flare-accelerated electrons of energy ~50 keV are the main source for white light production.",1

Probability does not conform to these assumptions when quantum mechanics is applied to account for the particular correlations Bell argues are locally inexplicable.

Our study analyzes the one-body density matrix and calculates the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy as a function of the interaction strength between the impurity and the bosons when all particles have the same mass. We show that the entropy grows very fast for small and moderate interaction strength and then increases slowly toward the strongly interacting regime. Then we study the effect over the quantum correlations of a mass imbalance between the impurity and the bosons. In the strongly interacting case, we discover that when the impurity is much heavier than the bosons, then we have the least possible correlation. However, the entropy tops its maximum when the mass ratio is between 3 and 4 in the case where there are four bosonic particles and then falls off to its minimum for higher mass imbalance.",1

117291,0,"A 17-billion-solar-mass black hole in a group galaxy with a diffuse core Quasars are associated with and powered by the accretion of material onto massive black holes; the detection of highly luminous quasars with redshifts greater than z = 6 suggests that black holes of up to ten billion solar masses already existed 13 billion years ago. Two possible present-day dormant descendants of this population of active black holes have been found in the galaxies NGC 3842 and NGC 4889 at the centres of the Leo and Coma galaxy clusters, which together form the central region of the Great Wall - the largest local structure of galaxies. The most luminous quasars, however, are not confined to such high-density regions of the early Universe; yet dormant black holes of this high mass have not yet been found outside of modern-day rich clusters. Here we report observations of the stellar velocity distribution in the galaxy NGC 1600 - a relatively isolated elliptical galaxy near the centre of a galaxy group at a distance of 64 Mpc from Earth. We use orbit superposition models to determine that the black hole at the centre of NGC 1600 has a mass of 17 billion solar masses. The spatial distribution of stars near the centre of NGC 1600 is rather diffuse. We find that the region of depleted stellar density in the cores of massive elliptical galaxies extends over the same radius as the gravitational sphere of influence of the central black holes, and interpret this as the dynamical imprint of the black holes.",1

Models in which all three QPO signals are produced at the same radius are considered: these include different versions of relativistic precession, epicyclic resonance, tidal disruption, and warped disc models. Models that were originally proposed to interpret only the twin high-frequency QPOs are generalized here to interpret also the low-frequency QPO in terms of relativistic nodal precession. Inferred values of the black hole mass and spin from each QPO model are compared with the mass measured from optical observations and the spin inferred from X-ray spectroscopy techniques. We find that along with the relativistic precession model predicting $M=(5.3\pm0.1)~M_{\odot}, a=0.286\pm0.004$, the so-called total precession model ($M=(5.5\pm0.1)~M_{\odot}, a=0.276\pm0.003$), and the resonance epicyclic model with beat frequency ($M=(5.1\pm0.1)~M_{\odot}, a=0.274\pm0.003$) also satisfy the optical mass test.

117517,0,"Equalizing resolution in smoothed-particle hydrodynamics calculations using self-adaptive sinc kernels The smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique is a numerical method for solving gas-dynamical problems. It has been applied to simulate the evolution of a wide variety of astrophysical systems. The method has a second-order accuracy, with a resolution that is usually much higher in the compressed regions than in the diluted zones of the fluid. In this work, we propose and check a scheme to balance and equalize the resolution of SPH between high- and low-density regions. This method relies on the versatility of a family of interpolators called Sinc kernels, which allows increasing the interpolation quality by varying only a single parameter (the exponent of the Sinc function). The scheme is checked and validated through a number of numerical tests, from standard one-dimensional Riemann problems in shock tubes, to multidimensional simulations of explosions, hydrodynamic instabilities and the collapse of a sun-like polytrope. The analysis of the hydrodynamical simulations suggests that the scheme devised to equalizing accuracy improves the treatment of the post-shock regions and, in general, of the rarefacted zones of fluids while causing no harm to the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities. The method is robust and easy to implement with a low computational overload. It conserves mass, energy, and momentum and reduces to the standard SPH scheme in regions of the fluid that have smooth density gradients.",1
117519,0,"A cluster-based mean-field and perturbative description of strongly correlated fermion systems. Application to the 1D and 2D Hubbard model We introduce a mean-field and perturbative approach, based on clusters, to describe the ground state of fermionic strongly-correlated systems. In cluster mean-field, the ground state wavefunction is written as a simple tensor product over optimized cluster states. The optimization of the single-particle basis where the cluster mean-field is expressed is crucial in order to obtain high-quality results. The mean-field nature of the ansatz allows us to formulate a perturbative approach to account for inter-cluster correlations; other traditional many-body strategies can be easily devised in terms of the cluster states. We present benchmark calculations on the half-filled 1D and (square) 2D Hubbard model, as well as the lightly-doped regime in 2D, using cluster mean-field and second-order perturbation theory. Our results indicate that, with sufficiently large clusters or to second-order in perturbation theory, a cluster-based approach can provide an accurate description of the Hubbard model in the considered regimes. Several avenues to improve upon the results presented in this work are discussed.",1

Basic to the proof is the so-called Diagonal Map, a natural transformation akin to the Bott map of algebraic topology, which increases by one unit both the momentum-space dimension and the symmetry index of translation-invariant ground states of gapped free-fermion systems. This mapping is illustrated here with a few examples of interest.",1
117642,0,"Bernoulli identities, zeta relations, determinant expressions, Mellin transforms, and representation of the Hurwitz numbers The Riemann zeta identity at even integers of Lettington, along with his other Bernoulli and zeta relations, are generalized.

A set of identities for the Ramanujan and generalized Ramanujan polynomials is presented. An alternative proof of Lettington's identity is provided, together with its generalizations to the Hurwitz and Lerch zeta functions, hence to Dirichlet $L$ series, to Eisenstein series, and to general Mellin transforms.

An integral representation of the Laurent coefficients about the origin for general $\wp$ functions, and for these numbers in particular, is presented.

117667,0,"Construction of the Lyapunov spectrum in a chaotic system displaying phase synchronization We consider a three-dimensional chaotic system consisting of the suspension of Arnold's cat map coupled with a clock via a weak dissipative interaction. We show that the coupled system displays a synchronization phenomenon, in the sense that the relative phase between the suspension flow and the clock locks to a special value, thus making the motion fall onto a lower dimensional attractor. More specifically, we construct the attractive invariant manifold, of dimension smaller than three, using a convergent perturbative expansion. Moreover, we compute via convergent series the Lyapunov exponents, including notably the central one. The result generalizes a previous construction of the attractive invariant manifold in a similar but simpler model. The main novelty of the current construction relies in the computation of the Lyapunov spectrum, which consists of non-trivial analytic exponents. Some conjectures about a possible smoothening transition of the attractor as the coupling is increased are also discussed.",1
117698,0,"Broad Balmer Absorption Line Variability: Evidence of Gas Transverse Motion in the QSO SDSS J125942.80+121312.6 We report on the discovery of broad Balmer absorption lines variability in the QSO SDSS J125942.80+121312.6, based on the optical and near-infrared spectra taken from the SDSS-I, SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and TripleSpec observations over a timescale of 5.8 years in the QSO's rest-frame. The blueshifted absorption profile of H$\beta$ shows a variation of more than 5$\sigma$ at a high velocity portion ($&gt;3000\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$) of the trough. We perform a detailed analysis for the physical conditions of the absorber using Balmer lines as well as metastable He I and optical Fe II absorptions ($\lambda 4233$ from b$^4$P$_{5/2}$ level and $\lambda 5169$ from a$^6$S$_{5/2}$) at the same velocity. These Fe II lines are identified in the QSO spectra for the first time. According to the photoionization simulations, we estimate a gas density of $n(\mathrm{H})\approx 10^{9.1}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and a column density of $N_{\mathrm{col}}(\mathrm{H})\approx 10^{23}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for the BOSS data, but the model fails to predict the variations of ionic column densities between the SDSS and BOSS observations if changes in ionizing flux are assumed. We thus propose transverse motion of the absorbing gas being the cause of the observed broad Balmer absorption line variability. In fact, we find that the changes in covering factors of the absorber can well-reproduce all of the observed variations. The absorber is estimated $\sim 0.94$ pc away from the central engine, which is where the outflow likely experiences deceleration due to the collision with the surrounding medium. This scheme is consistent with the argument that LoBAL QSOs may represent the transition from obscured star-forming galaxies to classic QSOs.",1

Our multi-frequency and multi-resolution radio surveys in nearby galaxies enable us to trace various phases of star formation and dissect the thermal and nonthermal ISM in galaxies. Mapping the cosmic ray electron energy index and magnetic field strength, we have found observational evidence that massive star formation significantly affects the energy balance in the ISM through the injection and acceleration of cosmic rays and the amplification of magnetic fields.

118182,0,"Dynamic Transposition of Melodic Sequences on Digital Devices A method is proposed which enables one to produce musical compositions by using transposition in place of harmonic progression. A transposition scale is introduced to provide a set of intervals commensurate with the musical scale, such as chromatic or just intonation scales. A sequence of intervals selected from the transposition scale is used to shift instrument frequency at predefined times during the composition which serves as a harmonic sequence of a composition. A transposition sequence constructed in such a way can be extended to a hierarchy of sequences. The fundamental sound frequency of an instrument is obtained as a product of the base frequency, instrument key factor, and a cumulative product of respective factors from all the harmonic sequences. The multiplication factors are selected from subsets of rational numbers, which form instrument scales and transposition scales of different levels. Each harmonic sequence can be related to its own transposition scale, or a single scale can be used for all levels. When composing for an orchestra of instruments, harmonic sequences and instrument scales can be assigned independently to each musical instrument. The method solves the problem of using just intonation scale across multiple octaves as well as simplifies writing of instrument scores.",1

Only products and inverses are used; differences are not used. It is made explicitly clear why constants occur in some bracket relations but not in others, and how some constants can be removed, so that in the end there is a constant in the bracket relations for the Galilei group but not for the Poincar\'e group. Each change of coordinates needs to be only to first order, so matrices are not needed for rotations or Lorentz transformations; simple three-vector descriptions are enough.

Significant performance gains have resulted from improvements to the Starbug system, including i) the use of a vacuum to attach Starbugs to the underside of a transparent field plate, ii) optimisation of the control electronics, iii) a simplified mechanical design with high sensitivity piezo actuators, and iv) the construction of a dedicated laboratory 'test rig'. A method of reliably rotating Starbugs in steps of several arcminutes has also been devised, which integrates with the pre-existing x-y movement directions and offers greater flexibility while positioning. We present measured performance data from a prototype system of 10 Starbugs under full (closed-loop control), at field plate angles of 0-90 degrees.",1
118681,0,"Single-shot implementation of dispersion-scan for the characterization of ultrashort laser pulses We demonstrate a novel, single-shot ultrafast diagnostic, based on the dispersion-scan (d-scan) technique. In this implementation, rather than scanning wedges to vary the dispersion as in standard d-scan, the pulse to be measured experiences a spatially varying amount of dispersion in a Littrow prism. The resulting beam is then imaged into a second-harmonic generation crystal and an imaging spectrometer is used to measure the two-dimensional trace, which is analyzed using the d-scan retrieval algorithm. We compare the single-shot implementation with the standard d-scan for the measurement of sub-3.5-fs pulses from a hollow core fiber pulse compressor. We show that the retrieval algorithm used to extract amplitude and phase of the pulse provides comparable results, proving the validity of the new single-shot implementation down to near single-cycle durations.",1
118751,0,"Rossby Wave Green's Functions in an Azimuthal Wind Green's functions for Rossby waves in an azimuthal wind are obtained, in which the stream-function $\psi$ depends on $r$, $\phi$ and $t$, where $r$ is cylindrical radius and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle in the $\beta$-plane relative to the easterly direction, in which the $x$-axis points east and the $y$-axis points north. The Rossby wave Green's function with no wind is obtained using Fourier transform methods, and is related to the previously known Green's function obtained for this case, which has a different but equivalent form to the Green's function obtained in the present paper. We emphasize the role of the wave eikonal solution, which plays an important role in the form of the solution. The corresponding Green's function for a rotating wind with azimuthal wind velocity ${\bf u}=\Omega r{\bf e}_\phi$ ($\Omega=$const.) is also obtained by Fourier methods, in which the advective rotation operator in position space is transformed to a rotation operator in ${\bf k}$ transform space. The finite Rossby deformation radius is included in the analysis. The physical characteristics of the Green's functions are delineated and applications are discussed. In the limit as $\Omega\to 0$, the rotating wind Green's function reduces to the Rossby wave Green function with no wind.",1

However, up till now, the origin of the Dirac points is unclear yet. Here, we discover a hidden symmetry on the honeycomb lattice and prove that the existence of Dirac points is exactly protected by such hidden symmetry. Furthermore, the moving and merging of the Dirac points and a quantum phase transition, which have been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed on the honeycomb lattice, can also be perfectly explained by the parameter dependent evolution of the hidden symmetry.",1
118948,0,"Comprehensive Numerical Modelling of a Low-Gain Optical Parametric Amplifier as a Front-End Contrast Enhancement Unit We present a comprehensive model for predicting the full performance of a second harmonic generationoptical parametric amplification system that aims at enhancing the temporal contrast of laser pulses. The model simultaneously takes into account all the main parameters at play in the system such as the group velocity mismatch, the beam divergence, the spectral content, the pump depletion, and the length of the nonlinear crystals. We monitor the influence of the initial parameters of the input pulse and the interdependence of the two related non-linear processes on the performance of the system and show its optimum configuration. The influence of the initial beam divergence on the spectral and the temporal characteristics of the generated pulse is discussed. In addition, we show that using a crystal slightly longer than the optimum length and introducing small delay between the seed and the pump ensures maximum efficiency and compensates for the spectral shift in the optical parametric amplification stage in case of chirped input pulse. As an example, calculations for bandwidth transform limited and chirped pulses of sub-picosecond duration in beta barium borate crystal are presented.",1
119057,0,"Baryon content and dynamic state of galaxy clusters: XMM-Newton observations of A1095 and A1926 We have initiated a program to study the baryon content and dynamic state of galaxy clusters. Here we present results primarily from XMM-Newton observations of two optically-selected galaxy clusters, A1095 ($z \simeq 0.210$) and A1926 ($z \simeq 0.136$). We find that both of them are actually cluster pairs at similar redshifts. We characterize the temperatures of these individual clusters through X-ray spectral fits and then estimate their gravitational masses. We show a rich set of substructures, including large position offsets between the diffuse X-ray centroids and the brightest galaxies of the clusters, which suggests that they are dynamically young. For both A1095 and A1926, we find that the mass required for the cluster pairs to be bound is smaller than the total gravitational mass. Thus both cluster pairs appear to be ongoing major mergers. Incorporating SDSS and NVSS/FIRST data, we further examine the large-scale structure environment and radio emission of the clusters to probe their origins, which also leads to the discovery of two additional X-ray-emitting clusters ($z \simeq 0.097$ and $z \simeq 0.147$) in the field of A1926. We estimate the hot gas and stellar masses of each cluster, which compared with the expected cosmological baryonic mass fraction, leave ample room for warm gas.",1

119379,0,"Influence of the Hall effect and electron inertia in collisionless magnetic reconnection We study the role of the Hall current and electron inertia in collisionless magnetic reconnection within the framework of full two-fluid MHD. At spatial scales smaller than the electron inertial length, a topological change of magnetic field lines exclusively due to electron inertia becomes possible. Assuming stationary conditions, we derive a theoretical scaling for the reconnection rate, which is simply proportional to the Hall parameter. Using a pseudo-spectral code with no dissipative effects, our numerical results confirm this theoretical scaling. In particular, for a sequence of different Hall parameter values, our numerical results show that the width of the current sheet is independent of the Hall parameter while its thickness is of the order of the electron inertial range, thus confirming that the stationary reconnection rate is proportional to the Hall parameter.",1

These comparisons indicate that Lustre provides 2x more storage capacity, is less likely to loose data during 3 simultaneous drive failures, and provides higher bandwidth on general purpose workloads. Hadoop can provide 4x greater read bandwidth on special purpose workloads. Accumulo provides 10,000x lower latency on random lookups than either Lustre or Hadoop but Accumulo's bulk bandwidth is 10x less.

We show that both the kink and the PT-invariant kink are linearly stable and obtain expressions for the zero mode in the case of several PT-invariant kink solutions. Further, for a number of real nonlinear equations we show that whenever a nonlinear equation admits periodic kink solutions in terms of $\sn(x,m)$, it also admits periodic solutions in terms of the PT-invariant combinations $\sn(x,m) \pm i \cn(x,m)$ as well as $\sn(x,m)\pm i \dn(x,m)$.

The charge density wave phase is similar as that of a Weyl semimetal while the nematic phase is unique for Dirac semimetals.

119718,0,"Active compensation of aperture discontinuities for WFIRST-AFTA: analytical and numerical comparison of propagation methods and preliminary results with a WFIRST-AFTA-like pupil The new frontier in the quest for the highest contrast levels in the focal plane of a coronagraph is now the correction of the large diffractive artifacts effects introduced at the science camera by apertures of increasing complexity. The coronagraph for the WFIRST/AFTA mission will be the first of such instruments in space with a two Deformable Mirrors wavefront control system. Regardless of the control algorithm for these multi Deformable Mirrors, they will have to rely on quick and accurate simulation of the propagation effects introduced by the out-of-pupil surface. In the first part of this paper, we present the analytical description of the different approximations to simulate these propagation effects. In Annex A, we prove analytically that, in the special case of surfaces inducing a converging beam, the Fresnel method yields high fidelity for simulations of these effects. We provide numerical simulations showing this effect. In the second part, we use these tools in the framework of the Active Compensation of Aperture Discontinuities technique (ACAD) applied to pupil geometries similar to WFIRST-AFTA. We present these simulations in the context of the optical layout of the High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes, which will test ACAD on a optical bench. The results of this analysis show that using the ACAD method, an apodized pupil lyot coronagraph and the performance of our current deformable mirrors, we are able to obtain, in numerically simulations, a dark hole with an AFTA-like pupil.

The microbubble is made using two counter-propagating CO$_2$ laser beams focused onto a microcapillary. The measured sensitivity is 19 GHz/bar at 1.55 $\mu$m.

119819,0,"Numerical Simulation of Superhalo Electrons Generated by Magnetic Reconnection in the Solar Wind Source Region Superhalo electrons appear to be continuously present in the interplanetary medium, even at very quiet times, with a power-law spectrum at energies above $\sim$2 keV. Here we numerically investigate the generation of superhalo electrons by magnetic reconnection in the solar wind source region, using the MHD and test particle simulations for both single X-line reconnection and multiple X-line reconnection. We find that the direct current electric field, produced in the magnetic reconnection region, can accelerate electrons from an initial thermal energy of T $\sim10^5$ K up to hundreds of keV. After acceleration, some of the accelerated electrons, together with the nascent solar wind flow driven by the reconnection, propagate upwards along the newly-opened magnetic field lines into the interplanetary space, while the rest move downwards into the lower atmosphere. Similar to the observed superhalo electrons at 1 AU, the flux of the upward-traveling accelerated electrons versus energy displays a power-law distribution at $\sim$ 2 $-$ 100 keV, $f(E) \sim E^{-\delta}$, with a $\delta$ of $\sim$ 1.5 $-$ 2.4. For single (multiple) X-line reconnection, the spectrum becomes harder (softer) as the anomalous resistivity parameter $\alpha$ (uniform resistivity $\eta$) increases. These modeling results suggest that the acceleration in the solar wind source region may contribute to superhalo electrons.",1

These developments include the dramatic increase in the adoption of distributed energy resources (DER), electric vehicles, energy storage, and controllable loads. This transformation imposes new challenges on existing distribution infrastructure and system operations for stockholders, engineers, operators and customers. Unfortunately, distribution networks historically lag behind transmission networks in terms of observability, measurement accuracy, and data granularity. The changes in the operation of the electric grid dramatically increase the need for tools to monitor and manage distribution networks in a fast, reliable and accurate fashion. This paper describes the development process of a network of high-precision micro phasor measurement units or uPMUs, beginning with an overview of the uPMU technology that provides synchronous measurements of voltage phase angles, or synchrophasors.

120037,0,"From the first stars to the first black holes The growth of the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) at z &gt; 6 is still a major challenge for theoretical models. If it starts from black hole (BH) remnants of Population III stars (light seeds with mass ~ 100 Msun) it requires super-Eddington accretion. An alternative route is to start from heavy seeds formed by the direct collapse of gas onto a ~ 10^5 Msun BH. Here we investigate the relative role of light and heavy seeds as BH progenitors of the first SMBHs. We use the cosmological, data constrained semi-analytic model GAMETE/QSOdust to simulate several independent merger histories of z &gt; 6 quasars. Using physically motivated prescriptions to form light and heavy seeds in the progenitor galaxies, we find that the formation of a few heavy seeds (between 3 and 30 in our reference model) enables the Eddington-limited growth of SMBHs at z &gt; 6. This conclusion depends sensitively on the interplay between chemical, radiative and mechanical feedback effects, which easily erase the conditions that allow the suppression of gas cooling in the low metallicity gas (Z &lt; Zcr and JLW &gt; Jcr). We find that heavy seeds can not form if dust cooling triggers gas fragmentation above a critical dust-to-gas mass ratio (D &gt; Dcr). In addition, the relative importance of light and heavy seeds depends on the adopted mass range for light seeds, as this dramatically affects the history of cold gas along the merger tree, by both SN and AGN-driven winds.",1

We analyse two mass-selected samples, one defined using photometric redshifts ($10.2 \le \log M_\ast/M_{\odot} \le 12.0$), and a smaller more robust subsample using spectroscopic redshifts ($10.6 \le \log M_\ast/M_{\odot} \le 11.8$). We find no significant difference in the size distributions of cluster and field galaxies of a given morphology. Similarly, we find no significant difference in the size distributions of cluster and field galaxies of similar rest-frame $B-V$ colours. We rule out average size differences larger than $10$--$20$\% in both cases. Consistent conclusions are found with the spectroscopic and photometric samples. These results have important consequences for the physical process(es) responsible for the size evolution of galaxies, and in particular the effect of the environment. The remarkable growth in galaxy size observed from $z\sim2.5$ has been reported to depend on the environment at higher redshifts ($z&gt;1$), with early-type/passive galaxies in higher density environments growing earlier. Such dependence disappears at lower redshifts. Therefore, if the reported difference at higher-$z$ is real, the growth of field galaxies has caught up with that of cluster galaxies by $z\sim1$. Any putative mechanism responsible for galaxy growth has to account for the existence of environmental differences at high redshift and their absence (or weakening) at lower redshifts.",1

120481,0,"Coupling of microwave magnetic dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films to stripline transducers in the geometry of the broadband stripline ferromagnetic resonance We constructed a quasi-analytical self-consistent model of the stripline-based broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements of ferromagnetic films. Exchange-free description of magnetization dynamics in the films allowed us to obtain simple analytical expressions. They enable quick and efficient numerical simulations of the dynamics. With this model we studied the contribution of radiation losses to the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth, as measured with the stripline FMR. We found that for films with large conductivity of metals the radiation losses are significantly smaller than for magneto-insulating films. Excitation of microwave eddy currents in these materials contributes to the total microwave impedance of the system. This leads to impedance mismatch with the film environment resulting in decoupling of the film from the environment and, ultimately, to smaller radiation losses. We also show that the radiation losses drop with an increase in the stripline width and when the sample is lifted up from the stripline surface. Hence, in order to eliminate this measurement artifact one needs to use wide striplines and introduce a spacer between the film and the sample surface. The radiation losses contribution is larger for thicker films.",1
120623,0,"Cold gas in cluster cores: Global stability analysis and non-linear simulations of thermal instability We perform global linear stability analysis and idealized numerical simulations in global thermal balance to understand the condensation of cold gas from hot/virial atmospheres (coronae), in particular the intracluster medium (ICM). We pay particular attention to geometry (e.g., spherical versus plane-parallel) and the nature of the gravitational potential. Global linear analysis gives a similar value for the fastest growing thermal instability modes in spherical and Cartesian geometries. Simulations and observations suggest that cooling in halos critically depends on the ratio of the cooling time to the free-fall time ($t_{cool}/t_{ff}$). Extended cold gas condenses out of the ICM only if this ratio is smaller than a threshold value close to 10. Previous works highlighted the difference between the nature of cold gas condensation in spherical and plane-parallel atmospheres; namely, cold gas condensation appeared easier in spherical atmospheres. This apparent difference due to geometry arises because the previous plane-parallel simulations focussed on {\em in situ} condensation of multiphase gas but spherical simulations studied condensation {\em anywhere} in the box. Unlike previous claims, our nonlinear simulations show that there are only minor differences in cold gas condensation, either in situ or anywhere, for different geometries. The amount of cold gas condensing depends on the shape of the gravitational potential well; gas has more time to condense if gravitational acceleration decreases toward the center. In our idealized simulations with heating balancing cooling in each layer, there can be significant mass/energy/momentum transfer across layers that can trigger condensation and drive $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$ far beyond the critical value close to 10. Triggered condensation is very prominent in plane-parallel simulations, in which a large amount of cold gas condenses out.",1
120633,0,"A Multi-Epoch SMA Study of the HH 211 Protostellar Jet: Jet Motion and Knot Formation HH 211 is a highly collimated jet with a chain of well-defined knots, powered by a nearby young Class 0 protostar. We have used 4 epochs (2004, 2008, 2010, and 2013) of Submillimeter Array (SMA) archive data to study the properties of the HH 211 jet in SiO (J=8-7). The jet shows similar reflection-symmetric wiggle structures in all epochs. The wiggle structures can all be fitted by an orbiting jet source model that includes a position shift due to proper motion of the jet, indicating that the wiggle propagates along the jet axis. Thus, this suggests the wiggle is indeed due to an orbital motion of the jet source. Proper motions of the knots are measured by using the peak positions of the knots in four epochs, and they are roughly the same and independent of the distance from the central source. The mean proper motion of the knots is $\sim$ 0.087 arcsec per year, resulting in a transverse velocity of $\sim$ 114 km s$^{-1}$, about 30\% lower than that measured before. Knots BK2 and BK3 have a well-defined linear velocity structure, with the fast jet material upstream to the slow jet material. The gradient of the velocity structure decreases from knot BK2 to BK3. In addition, for each knot, the gradient decreases with time, as the knot propagates away from the central source.

This noise source can limit the signal-to-noise ratio and jeopardize photon-noise limited data. The subject of the present work is to compare measurements of modal noise and focal-ratio degradation (FRD) for several commonly-used fibres. We study the influence of a simple mechanical scrambling method (excenter) on both FRD and modal noise. Measurements are performed with circular and octagonal fibres from Polymicro Technology (FBP-Series) with diameters of 100, 200 and 300 {\mu}m and for square and rectangular fibres from CeramOptec, among others. FRD measurements for the same sample of fibres are performed as a function of wavelength. Furthermore, we replaced the circular fibre of the STELLA-echelle-spectrograph (SES) in Tenerife with an octagonal and found a SNR increase by a factor of 1.6 at 678 nm. It is shown in the laboratory that an excenter with a large amplitude and low frequency will not influence the FRD but will reduce modal noise rather effectively by up to 180%.",1

121043,0,"On the relation of optical obscuration and X-ray absorption in Seyfert galaxies The optical classification of a Seyfert galaxy and whether it is considered X-ray absorbed are often used interchangeably. But there are many borderline cases and also numerous examples where the optical and X-ray classifications appear to be in conflict. In this article we re-visit the relation between optical obscuration and X-ray absorption in AGNs. We make use of our ""dust color"" method (Burtscher et al. 2015) to derive the optical obscuration A_V and consistently estimated X-ray absorbing columns using 0.3--150 keV spectral energy distributions. We also take into account the variable nature of the neutral gas column N_H and derive the Seyfert sub-classes of all our objects in a consistent way. We show in a sample of 25 local, hard-X-ray detected Seyfert galaxies (log L_X / (erg/s) ~ 41.5 - 43.5) that there can actually be a good agreement between optical and X-ray classification. If Seyfert types 1.8 and 1.9 are considered unobscured, the threshold between X-ray unabsorbed and absorbed should be chosen at a column N_H = 10^22.3 / cm^2 to be consistent with the optical classification. We find that N_H is related to A_V and that the N_H/A_V ratio is approximately Galactic or higher in all sources, as indicated previously. But in several objects we also see that deviations from the Galactic ratio are only due to a variable X-ray column, showing that (1) deviations from the Galactic N_H/A_V can simply be explained by dust-free neutral gas within the broad line region in some sources, that (2) the dust properties in AGNs can be similar to Galactic dust and that (3) the dust color method is a robust way to estimate the optical extinction towards the sublimation radius in all but the most obscured AGNs.",1
121061,0,"The temperature and chronology of heavy-element synthesis in low-mass stars Roughly half of the heavy elements (atomic mass greater than that of iron) are believed to be synthesized in the late evolutionary stages of stars with masses between 0.8 and 8 solar masses. Deep inside the star, nuclei (mainly iron) capture neutrons and progressively build up (through the slow-neutron-capture process, or s-process) heavier elements that are subsequently brought to the stellar surface by convection. Two neutron sources, activated at distinct temperatures, have been proposed: 13C and 22Ne, each releasing one neutron per alpha-particle (4He) captured. To explain the measured stellar abundances, stellar evolution models invoking the 13C neutron source (which operates at temperatures of about one hundred million kelvin) are favoured. Isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites, however, reflecting nucleosynthesis in the previous generations of stars that contributed material to the Solar System, point to higher temperatures (more than three hundred million kelvin), requiring at least a late activation of 22Ne. Here we report a determination of the s-process temperature directly in evolved low-mass giant stars, using zirconium and niobium abundances, independently of stellar evolution models. The derived temperature supports 13C as the s-process neutron source. The radioactive pair 93Zr-93Nb used to estimate the s-process temperature also provides, together with the pair 99Tc-99Ru, chronometric information on the time elapsed since the start of the s-process, which we determine to be one million to three million years.",1
121179,0,"Flat bands and PT-symmetry in quasi-one-dimensional lattices We examine the effect of adding PT-symmetric gain and loss terms to quasi 1D lattices (ribbons) that possess flat bands. We focus on three representative cases: (a) The Lieb ribbon, (b) The kagome ribbon, and (c) The stub Ribbon. In general we find that the effect on the flat band depends strongly on the geometrical details of the lattice being examined. One interesting and novel result that emerge from an analytical calculation of the band structure of the Lieb ribbon including gain and loss, is that its flat band survives the addition of PT-symmetry for any amount of gain and loss, while for the other two lattices, any presence of gain and loss destroys the flat bands. For all three ribbons, there are finite stability windows whose size decreases with the strength of the gain and loss parameter. For the Lieb and kagome cases, the size of this window converges to a finite value. The existence of finite stability windows, plus the constancy of the Lieb flat band are in marked contrast to the behavior of a pure one-dimensional lattice.",1
121235,0,"Imaging resonances in low-energy NO-He inelastic collisions In molecular collisions, resonances occur at specific energies where the colliding particles temporarily form quasi-bound complexes, resulting in rapid variations in the energy dependence of scattering cross sections. Experimentally, it has proven challenging to observe such scattering resonances, especially in differential cross sections. We report the observation of resonance fingerprints in the state-to-state differential cross sections for inelastic NO-He collisions in the 13 to 19 cm$^{-1}$ energy range with 0.3 cm$^{-1}$ resolution. The observed structures were in excellent agreement with quantum scattering calculations. They were analyzed by separating the resonance contributions to the differential cross sections from the background through a partitioning of the multichannel scattering matrix. This revealed the partial wave composition of the resonances, and their evolution during the collision.",1
121319,0,"Floquet Weyl Phases in a Three Dimensional Network Model We study the topological properties of 3D Floquet bandstructures, which are defined using unitary evolution matrices rather than Hamiltonians. Previously, 2D bandstructures of this sort have been shown to exhibit anomalous topological behaviors, such as topologically-nontrivial zero-Chern-number phases. We show that the bandstructure of a 3D network model can exhibit Weyl phases, which feature ""Fermi arc"" surface states like those found in Weyl semimetals. Tuning the network's coupling parameters can induce transitions between Weyl phases and various topologically distinct gapped phases. We identify a connection between the topology of the gapped phases and the topology of Weyl point trajectories in k-space. The model is feasible to realize in custom electromagnetic networks, where the Weyl point trajectories can be probed by scattering parameter measurements.",1
121325,0,"Connecting the Dots: Tracking Galaxy Evolution Using Constant Cumulative Number Density at 3 Using the cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamical code GADGET-3 we make a realistic assessment of the technique of using constant cumulative number density as a tracer of galaxy evolution at high redshift. We find that over a redshift range of $3\leq z \leq7$ one can on average track the growth of the stellar mass of a population of galaxies selected from the same cumulative number density bin to within $\sim 0.20$ dex. Over the stellar mass range we probe ($10^{10.39}\leq M_s/M_\odot \leq 10^{10.75}$ at $z =$ 3 and $10^{8.48}\leq M_s/M_\odot \leq 10^{9.55}$ at $z =$ 7) one can reduce this bias by selecting galaxies based on an evolving cumulative number density. We find the cumulative number density evolution exhibits a trend towards higher values which can be quantified by simple linear formulations going as $-0.10\Delta z$ for descendants and $0.12\Delta z$ for progenitors. Utilizing such an evolving cumulative number density increases the accuracy of descendant/progenitor tracking by a factor of $\sim2$. This result is in excellent agreement, within $0.10$ dex, with abundance matching results over the same redshift range. However, we find that our more realistic cosmological hydrodynamic simulations produce a much larger scatter in descendant/progenitor stellar masses than previous studies, particularly when tracking progenitors. This large scatter makes the application of either the constant cumulative number density or evolving cumulative number density technique limited to average stellar masses of populations only, as the diverse mass assembly histories caused by stochastic physical processes such as gas accretion, mergers, and star formation of individual galaxies will lead to a larger scatter in other physical properties such as metallicity and star-formation rate.",1
121364,0,"The APOSTLE project: Local Group kinematic mass constraints and simulation candidate selection We use a large sample of isolated dark matter halo pairs drawn from cosmological N-body simulations to identify candidate systems whose kinematics match that of the Local Group of Galaxies (LG). We find, in agreement with the ""timing argument"" and earlier work, that the separation and approach velocity of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies favour a total mass for the pair of ~ 5*10^12 M_sun. A mass this large, however, is difficult to reconcile with the small relative tangential velocity of the pair, as well as with the small deceleration from the Hubble flow observed for the most distant LG members. Halo pairs that match these three criteria have average masses a factor of ~2 times smaller than suggested by the timing argument, but with large dispersion, spanning more than a decade in mass. Guided by these results, we have selected 12 halo pairs with total mass in the range 1.6-3.6 *10^12 M_sun for the APOSTLE project (A Project Of Simulations of The Local Environment), a suite of resimulations at various numerical resolution levels (reaching up to ~10^4 M_sun per gas particle) that use the hydrodynamical code and subgrid physics developed for the EAGLE project. These simulations reproduce, by construction, the main kinematics of the MW-M31 pair, and produce satellite populations whose overall number, luminosities, and kinematics are in good agreement with observations of the MW and M31 companions. These diagnostics are sensitive to the total mass assumed for the MW-M31 pair; indeed, the LG satellite population would be quite difficult to reproduce for pair masses as high as indicated by the timing argument. The APOSTLE candidate systems thus provide an excellent testbed to confront directly many of the predictions of the Lambda-CDM cosmology with observations of our local Universe.",1
121368,0,"Solvable 4-state Landau-Zener model of two interacting qubits with path interference We identify a nontrivial 4-state Landau-Zener model for which transition probabilities between any pair of diabatic states can be determined analytically and exactly. The model describes an experimentally accessible system of two interacting qubits, such as a localized state in a Dirac material with both valley and spin degrees of freedom or a singly charged quantum dot (QD) molecule with spin orbit coupling. Application of the linearly time-dependent magnetic field induces a sequence of quantum level crossings with possibility of interference of different trajectories in a semiclassical picture. We argue that this system satisfies the criteria of integrability in the multistate Landau-Zener theory, which allows us to derive explicit exact analytical expressions for the transition probability matrix. We also argue that this model is likely a special case of a larger class of solvable systems, and present a 6-state generalization as an example.",1
121406,0,"Image Stacking Analysis of SDSS Galaxies with AKARI Far-Infrared Surveyor Maps at 65{\mu}m, 90{\mu}m, and 140{\mu}m We perform image stacking analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric galaxies over the AKARI Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) maps at 65{\mu}m, 90{\mu}m, and 140{\mu}m. The resulting image profiles are decomposed into the central galaxy component (single term) and the nearby galaxy component (clustering term), as a function of the r-band magnitude, m_r of the central galaxy. We find that the mean far-infrared (FIR) flux of a galaxy with magnitude m_r is well fitted with f^s_{90{\mu}m}=13*10^{0.306(18-m_r)}[mJy]. The FIR amplitude of the clustering term is consistent with that expected from the angular-correlation function of the SDSS galaxies, but galaxy morphology dependence needs to be taken into account for a more quantitative conclusion. We also fit the spectral energy distribution of stacked galaxies at 65{\mu}m, 90{\mu}m, and 140{\mu}m, and derive a mean dust temperature of ~30K. This is consistent with the typical dust temperature of galaxies that are FIR luminous and individually detected.",1
121468,0,"Supernovae and their host galaxies - III. The impact of bars and bulges on the radial distribution of supernovae in disc galaxies We present an analysis of the impact of bars and bulges on the radial distributions of the different types of supernovae (SNe) in the stellar discs of host galaxies with various morphologies. We use a well-defined sample of 500 nearby (&lt; 100 Mpc) SNe and their low-inclined (i &lt; 60 deg) and morphologically non-disturbed S0-Sm host galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that in Sa-Sm galaxies, all core-collapse (CC) and vast majority of SNe Ia belong to the disc, rather than the bulge component. The radial distribution of SNe Ia in S0-S0/a galaxies is inconsistent with their distribution in Sa-Sm hosts, which is probably due to the contribution of the outer bulge SNe Ia in S0-S0/a galaxies. In Sa-Sbc galaxies, the radial distribution of CC SNe in barred hosts is inconsistent with that in unbarred ones, while the distributions of SNe Ia are not significantly different. At the same time, the radial distributions of both types of SNe in Sc-Sm galaxies are not affected by bars. We propose that the additional mechanism shaping the distributions of Type Ia and CC SNe can be explained within the framework of substantial suppression of massive star formation in the radial range swept by strong bars, particularly in early-type spirals. The radial distribution of CC SNe in unbarred Sa-Sbc galaxies is more centrally peaked and inconsistent with that in unbarred Sc-Sm hosts, while the distribution of SNe Ia in unbarred galaxies is not affected by host morphology. These results can be explained by the distinct distributions of massive stars in the discs of early- and late-type spirals.",1

121638,0,"Computing collinear 4-Body Problem central configurations with given masses An interesting description of a collinear configuration of four particles is found in terms of two spherical coordinates. An algorithm to compute the four coordinates of particles of a collinear Four-Body central configuration is presented by using an orthocentric tetrahedron, which edge lengths are function of given masses. Each mass is placed at the corresponding vertex of the tetrahedron. The center of mass (and orthocenter) of the tetrahedron is at the origin of coordinates. The initial position of the tetrahedron is placed with two pairs of vertices each in a coordinate plan, the lines joining any pair of them parallel to a coordinate axis, the center of masses of each and the center of mass of the four on one coordinate axis. From this original position the tetrahedron is rotated by two angles around the center of mass until the direction of configuration coincides with one axis of coordinates. The four coordinates of the vertices of the tetrahedron along this direction determine the central configuration by finding the two angles corresponding to it. The twelve possible configurations predicted by Moulton's theorem are computed for a particular mass choice.",1

121832,0,"Classical nature of ordered quantum phases and origin of spontaneous symmetry breaking We analyse the nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking in complex quantum systems by investigating the long-standing conjecture that the maximally symmetry-breaking quantum ground states are the most classical ones corresponding to a globally ordered phase. We make this argument quantitatively precise by comparing different local and global indicators of classicality and quantumness, respectively in symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving quantum ground states. We first discuss how naively comparing local, pairwise entanglement and discord apparently leads to the opposite conclusion. Indeed, we show that in symmetry-preserving ground states the two-body entanglement captures only a modest portion of the total two-body quantum correlations, while, on the contrary, in maximally symmetry-breaking ground states it contributes the largest amount to the total two-body quantum correlations. We then put to test the conjecture by looking at the global, macroscopic correlation properties of quantum ground states. We prove that the ground states which realize the maximum breaking of the Hamiltonian symmetries, associated to a globally ordered phase, are the only ones that: I) are always locally convertible, i.e. can be obtained from all other ground states by only applying LOCC transformations (local operations and classical communication), while the reverse is never possible; II) minimize the monogamy inequality on the globally shared, macroscopic bipartite entanglement.",1

It is shown that the problem can be reduced to a perturbed pendulum-like equation. This is done by finding two constants of motion. Firstly, a generalized problem using Melnikov type analysis and topological degree arguments is studied for showing the existence of periodic (libration), shift periodic (rotation), and chaotic solutions. Then these general results are applied to the PT-symmetric dimer. It is interestingly shown that if a sufficient condition is satisfied, then rotation modes, which do not exist in the dimer with constant gain-loss, will persist. An approximate threshold for PT-broken phase corresponding to the disappearance of bounded solutions is also presented. Numerical study is presented accompanying the analytical results.",1

122066,0,"Gluing Eguchi-Hanson metrics and a question of Page In 1978, Gibbons-Pope and Page proposed a physical picture for the Ricci flat K\""ahler metrics on the K3 surface based on a gluing construction. In this construction, one starts from a flat torus with $16$ orbifold points, and resolves the orbifold singularities by gluing in $16$ small Eguchi-Hanson manifolds which all have the same orientation. This construction was carried out rigorously by Topiwala, LeBrun-Singer, and Donaldson. In 1981, Page asked whether the above construction can be modified by reversing the orientations of some of the Eguchi-Hanson manifolds. This is a subtle question: if successful, this construction would produce Einstein metrics which are neither K\""ahler nor self-dual. In this paper, we focus on a configuration of maximal symmetry involving $8$ small Eguchi-Hanson manifolds of each orientation which are arranged according to a chessboard pattern. By analyzing the interactions between Eguchi-Hanson manifolds with opposite orientation, we identify a non-vanishing obstruction to the gluing problem, thereby destroying any hope of producing a metric of zero Ricci curvature in this way. Using this obstruction, we are able to understand the dynamics of such metrics under Ricci flow as long as the Eguchi-Hanson manifolds remain small. In particular, for the configuration described above, we obtain an ancient solution to the Ricci flow with the property that the maximum of the Riemann curvature tensor blows up at a rate of $(-t)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, while the maximum of the Ricci curvature converges to $0$.",1

122945,0,"A survey of luminous high-redshift quasars with SDSS and WISE. I. target selection and optical spectroscopy High-redshift quasars are important tracers of structure and evolution in the early universe. However, they are very rare and difficult to find when using color selection because of contamination from late-type dwarfs. High-redshift quasar surveys based on only optical colors suffer from incompleteness and low identification efficiency, especially at $z\gtrsim4.5$. We have developed a new method to select $4.7\lesssim z \lesssim 5.4$ quasars with both high efficiency and completeness by combining optical and mid-IR Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) photometric data, and are conducting a luminous $z\sim5$ quasar survey in the whole Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint.

In addition, we also observed 14 fainter candidates selected with the same criteria and identified 8 (57.1\%) of them as quasars with $4.74.5$, which will set strong constraints on the bright end of the quasar luminosity function.

In this work, we propose an alternative approach to assessing topologically induced edge states in free and interacting fermionic systems. We do so by focussing on the fermionic covariance matrix. This matrix is often tractable either analytically or numerically and it precisely captures the relevant correlations of the system. By invoking the concept of monogamy of entanglement we show that highly entangled states supported across a system bi-partition are largely disentangled from the rest of the system, thus appearing usually as gapless edge states. We then define an entanglement qualifier that identifies the presence of topological edge states based purely on correlations present in the ground states. We demonstrate the versatility of this qualifier by applying it to various free and interacting fermionic topological systems.",1

123072,0,"Properties of the Fast Forward Shock Driven by the July 23 2012 Extreme Coronal Mass Ejection Late on July 23, 2012, the STEREO-A spacecraft encountered a fast forward shock driven by a coronal mass ejection launched from the Sun earlier that same day. The estimated travel time of the disturbance ($\sim 20$ hrs), together with the massive magnetic field strengths measured within the ejecta ($&gt; 100$nT), made it one of the most extreme events observed during the space era. In this study, we examine the properties of the shock wave. Because of an instrument malfunction, plasma measurements during the interval surrounding the CME were limited, and our approach has been modified to capitalize on the available measurements and suitable proxies, where possible. We were able to infer the following properties. First, the shock normal was pointing predominantly in the radial direction (${\bf n} = 0.97 {\bf e}_r -0.09 {\bf e}_t -0.23 {\bf e}_n$). Second, the angle between ${\bf n}$ and the upstream magnetic field, $\theta_{Bn}$, was estimated to be $\approx 34^{\circ}$, making the shock ""quasi-parallel,"" and supporting the idea of an earlier ""preconditioning"" ICME. Third, the shock speed was estimated to be $\approx 3300$ km s$^{-1}$. Fourth, the sonic Mach number, $M_s$, for this shock was $\sim 28$. We support these results with an idealized numerical simulation of the ICME. Finally, we estimated the change in ram pressure upstream of the shock to be $\sim 5$ times larger than the pressure from the energetic particles, suggesting that this was not a standard ""steady-state"" cosmic-ray modified shock (CRMS). Instead it might represent an early, transient phase in the evolution of the CRMS.",1
123231,0,"Interferometric observation of microlensing events Interferometric observations of microlensing events have the potential to provide unique constraints on the physical properties of the lensing systems. In this work, we first present a formalism that closely combines interferometric and microlensing observable quantities, which lead us to define an original microlensing (u,v) plane. We run simulations of long-baseline interferometric observations and photometric light curves to decide which observational strategy is required to obtain a precise measurement on vector Einstein radius. We finally perform a detailed analysis of the expected number of targets in the light of new microlensing surveys (2011+) which currently deliver 2000 alerts/year. We find that a few events are already at reach of long baseline interferometers (CHARA, VLTI), and a rate of about 6 events/year is expected with a limiting magnitude of K~10. This number would increase by an order of magnitude by raising it to K~11. We thus expect that a new route for characterizing microlensing events will be opened by the upcoming generations of interferometers.",1
123255,0,"Nuclear discs as clocks for the assembly history of early-type galaxies: the case of NGC4458 Approximately 20% of early-type galaxies host small nuclear stellar discs that are tens to a few hundred parsecs in size. Such discs are expected to be easily disrupted during major galactic encounters, hence their age serve to constrain their assembly history. We use VIMOS integral-field spectroscopic observations for the intermediate-mass E0 galaxy NGC4458 and age-date its nuclear disc via high-resolution fitting of various model spectra. We find that the nuclear disc is at least 6 Gyr old. A clue to gain narrow limits to the stellar age is our knowledge of the nuclear disc contribution to the central surface brightness. The presence of an old nuclear disk, or the absence of disruptive encounters since z~0.6, for a small galaxy such as NGC4458 which belongs to the Virgo cluster, may be consistent with a hierarchical picture for galaxy formation where the smallest galaxies assembles earlier and the crowded galactic environments reduce the incidence of galaxy mergers. On the other hand, NGC4458 displays little or no bulk rotation except for a central kpc-scale kinematically-decoupled core. Slow rotation and decoupled core are usually explained in terms of mergers. The presence and age of the nuclear disc constraint these mergers to have happened at high redshift.",1
123290,0,"The Semiclassical Coherent State Propagator in the Weyl Representation It is shown that the semiclassical coherent state propagator takes its simplest form when the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian is replaced by its Weyl symbol in defining the classical action, in that there is then no need of a Solari-Kochetov correction. It is also shown that such a correction exists if a symbol other than the Weyl symbol is chosen, and that its form is different depending on the symbol chosen. The various forms of the propagator based on different symbols are shown to be equivalent provided the correspondingly correct Solari-Kochetov correction is included. All these results are shown for both particle and spin coherent state propagators. The global anomaly in the fluctuation determinant is further elucidated by a study of the connection bewteen the discrete fluctuation determinant and the discrete Jacobi equation.",1

The integrability of the deformed equations is altered and a notion of weak integrability is introduced. We implement this scheme in the AKNS and SO(3) hierarchies and obtain known and new equations.

The maximization of entropy, often used to introduce the non-extensive statistical mechanics, is a formal procedure and does not easily leads to physical insight. In this article we investigate the canonical ensemble in the non-extensive statistical mechanics by considering a small system interacting with a large reservoir via short-range forces and assuming equal probabilities for all available microstates. We concentrate on the situation when the reservoir is characterized by generalized entropy with non-extensivity parameter q&gt;1.

The polarization of an isolated atom in the external field calculated via the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation agrees with our analytical findings. For the practically important case of one strong laser field and several weaker fields we derive and analytically solve propagation equations describing high-order (HO) wave-mixing, HO parametric amplification and HO stimulated scattering. These processes provide a way of efficient coherent XUV generation. Some properties of HO processes are new in nonlinear optics: essentially complex values of the coefficients in the propagation equations, the super-exponential (hyperbolic) growing solutions, etc. Finally, we suggest conditions for the practical realization of these processes and discuss published numerical and experimental results where such processes could have been observed.",1
123708,0,"Near-equilibrium universality and bounds on efficiency in quasi-static regime with finite source and sink We show the validity of some results of finite-time thermodynamics, also within the quasi-static framework of classical thermodynamics. First, we consider the efficiency at maximum work (EMW) from finite source and sink modelled as identical thermodynamic systems. The near-equilibrium regime is characterized by expanding the internal energy upto second order (i.e. upto linear response) in the difference of initial entropies of the source and the sink. It is shown that the efficiency is given by a universal expression $2 \eta_C / (4-\eta_C)$, where $\eta_C$ is the Carnot efficiency. Then, different sizes of source and sink are treated, by combining different numbers of copies of the same thermodynamic system. The efficiency of this process is found to be ${\boldsymbol\eta}_0 = \eta_C/ (2-\gamma \eta_C)$, where the parameter $\gamma$ depends only on the relative size of the source and the sink. This implies that within the linear response theory, EMW is bounded as ${\eta_C}/{2} \le {{\boldsymbol\eta}}_0 \le {\eta_C}/{(2 - \eta_C)}$, where the upper (lower) bound is obtained with a sink much larger (smaller) in size than the source. We also remark on the behavior of the efficiency beyond linear response.",1

Velocity-resolved Reverberation Mapping of H$\beta$ Line In the sixth of the series of papers reporting on a large reverberation mapping (RM) campaign of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with high accretion rates, we present velocity-resolved time lags of H$\beta$ emission lines for nine objects observed in the campaign during 2012$-$2013. In order to correct the line-broadening caused by seeing and instruments before the analysis of velocity-resolved RM, we adopt Richardson-Lucy deconvolution to reconstruct their H$\beta$ profiles. The validity and effectiveness of the deconvolution are checked out by Monte Carlo simulation. Five among the nine objects show clear dependence of time delay on velocity. Mrk 335 and Mrk 486 show signatures of gas inflow whereas the clouds in the broad-line regions (BLRs) of Mrk 142 and MCG +06-26-012 tend to be radial outflowing. Mrk 1044 is consistent with the case of virialized motions. The lags of the rest four are not velocity-resolvable. The velocity-resolved RM of super-Eddington accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs) shows that they have diversity of the kinematics in their BLRs. Comparing with the AGNs with sub-Eddington accretion rates, we do not find significant differences in the BLR kinematics of SEAMBHs.",1

We explicitly construct all the classical ground states of the model. To describe quantum fluctuations above these classical states, we apply linear flavor-wave theory. At zero temperature, the bosonic flavor waves select the simplest of these SU(4) symmetry breaking states, the four-sublattice ordered state defined by the cubic unit cell of the fcc lattice. Due to geometrical constraints, flavor waves interact along specific planes only, thus rendering the system effectively two dimensional and forbidding ordering at finite temperatures. We argue that longer range interactions generated by quantum fluctuations can shift the transition to finite temperatures.",1

123828,0,"Stabilization and time resolved measurement of the frequency evolution of a modulated diode laser for chirped pulse generation We have developed experimental methods for the generation of chirped laser pulses of controlled frequency evolution in the nanosecond pulse length range for coherent atomic interaction studies. The pulses are sliced from the radiation of a cw external cavity diode laser while its drive current, and consequently its frequency, are sinusoidally modulated. By the proper choice of the modulation parameters, as well as of the timing of pulse slicing, we can produce a wide variety of frequency sweep ranges during the pulse. In order to obtain the required frequency chirp, we need to stabilize the center frequency of the modulated laser and to measure the resulting frequency evolution with appropriate temporal resolution. These tasks have been solved by creating a beat signal with a reference laser locked to an atomic transition frequency. The beat signal is then analyzed, as well as its spectral sideband peaks are fed back to the electronics of the frequency stabilization of the modulated laser. This method is simple and it has the possibility for high speed frequency sweep with narrow bandwidth that is appropriate, for example, for selective manipulation of atomic states in a magneto-optical trap.",1
123886,0,"The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. VII. The intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity galaxies in the core of the Virgo cluster, and a comparison with the Local Group (Abridged) We investigate the intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity galaxies in the central 300 kpc of the Virgo cluster using deep imaging obtained as part of the NGVS. We build a sample of nearly 300 red-sequence cluster members in the yet unexplored $-14 &lt; M_{g} &lt; -8$ magnitude range. The observed distribution of apparent axis ratios is then fit by families of triaxial models with normally-distributed intrinsic ellipticities and triaxialities. We develop a Bayesian framework to explore the posterior distribution of the model parameters, which allows us to work directly on discrete data, and to account for individual, surface brightness-dependent axis ratio uncertainties. For this population we infer a mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.43, and a mean triaxiality T=0.16. This implies that faint Virgo galaxies are best described as a family of thick, nearly oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57. We additionally attempt a study of the intrinsic shapes of Local Group satellites of similar luminosities. For the LG population we infer a slightly larger mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.51, and the paucity of objects with round apparent shapes translates into more triaxial mean shapes, 1:0.76:0.49. We finally compare the intrinsic shapes of NGVS low-mass galaxies with samples of more massive quiescent systems, and with field, star-forming galaxies of similar luminosities. We find that the intrinsic flattening in this low-luminosity regime is almost independent of the environment in which the galaxy resides--but there is a hint that objects may be slightly rounder in denser environments. The comparable flattening distributions of low-luminosity galaxies that have experienced very different degrees of environmental effects suggests that internal processes are the main drivers of galaxy structure at low masses--with external mechanisms playing a secondary role.",1

Orbital Properties of Low Mass White Dwarf Binaries We present the discovery of 15 extremely low mass (5 &lt; log{g} &lt; 7) white dwarf candidates, 9 of which are in ultra-compact double-degenerate binaries. Our targeted ELM Survey sample now includes 76 binaries. The sample has a lognormal distribution of orbital periods with a median period of 5.4 hr. The velocity amplitudes imply that the binary companions have a normal distribution of mass with 0.76 Msun mean and 0.25 Msun dispersion. Thus extremely low mass white dwarfs are found in binaries with a typical mass ratio of 1:4. Statistically speaking, 95% of the white dwarf binaries have a total mass below the Chandrasekhar mass and thus are not Type Ia supernova progenitors.

The regions surrounding the black holes powering the jets in AGNs are expected to have dense magnetized plasmas, possibly giving rise to very large Faraday rotations. Compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are good candidates to search for very large Faraday rotated components as they contain compact emission from close to the black hole and many are strongly depolarized at centimeter wavelengths as expected from strong Faraday effects.

124142,0,"Metal Enrichment in the Reionization Epoch The presence of elements heavier than helium (""metals"") is of fundamental importance for a large number of astrophysical processes occurring in planet, star and galaxy formation; it also affects cosmic structure formation and evolution in several ways. Even a small amount of heavy elements can dramatically alter the chemistry of the gas, opening the path to complex molecules. Metals might enhance the ability of the gas to radiate away its thermal energy, thus favoring the formation of gravitationally bound objects; they can also condensate in a solid phase (dust grains), partly or totally blocking radiation from luminous sources. Finally, they represent useful tracers of energy deposition by stars and probe the physical properties of the environment by absorption or emission lines. Last, but certainly not least, life -- as we know it on Earth -- is tightly related to the presence of at least some of the heavy elements. In this pedagogical review I will concentrate on the connection between early metal enrichment and cosmic reionization. As we will see these two processes are intimately connected and their joint study might turn out to be fundamental in understanding the overall evolution of the Universe during the first billion years after the Big Bang, an epoch corresponding to redshifts z&gt;6.",1

124458,0,"A theory of 2+1D bosonic topological orders In primary school, we were told that there are four phases of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. In college, we learned that there are much more than four phases of matter, such as hundreds of crystal phases, liquid crystal phases, ferromagnet, anti-ferromagnet, superfluid, etc. Those phases of matter are so rich, it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the symmetry breaking theory of Landau. However, there are even more interesting phases of matter that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. In this paper, we review new ""topological"" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the existence of those new zero-temperature phases -- topologically ordered phases. Microscopically, topologically orders are originated from the patterns of long-range entanglement in the ground states. As a truly new type of order and a truly new kind of phenomena, topological order and long-range entanglement require a new language and a new mathematical framework, such as unitary fusion category and modular tensor category to describe them. In this paper, we will describe a simple mathematical framework based on measurable quantities of topological orders $(S,T,c)$ proposed around 1989. The framework allows us to systematically describe/classify 2+1D topological orders (ie topological orders in local bosonic/spin/qubit systems)..",1
124532,0,"A Comprehensive Archival Chandra Search for X-ray Emission from Ultracompact Dwarf Galaxies We present the first comprehensive archival study of the X-ray properties of ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies, with the goal of identifying weakly-accreting central black holes in UCDs. Our study spans 578 UCDs distributed across thirteen different host systems, including clusters, groups, fossil groups, and isolated galaxies. Of the 336 spectroscopically-confirmed UCDs with usable archival Chandra imaging observations, 21 are X-ray-detected. Imposing a completeness limit of $L_X&gt;2\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the global X-ray detection fraction for the UCD population is $\sim3\%$. Of the 21 X-ray-detected UCDs, seven show evidence of long-term X-ray time variability on the order of months to years. X-ray-detected UCDs tend to be more compact than non-X-ray-detected UCDs, and we find tentative evidence that the X-ray detection fraction increases with surface luminosity density and global stellar velocity dispersion. The X-ray emission of UCDs is fully consistent with arising from a population of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In fact, there are fewer X-ray sources than expected using a naive extrapolation from globular clusters. Invoking the fundamental plane of black hole activity for SUCD1 near the Sombrero galaxy, for which archival Jansky Very Large Array imaging at 5 GHz is publicly available, we set an upper limit on the mass of a hypothetical central black hole in that UCD to be $\lesssim10^5M_{\odot}$. While the majority of our sources are likely LMXBs, we cannot rule out central black holes in some UCDs based on X-rays alone, and so we address the utility of follow-up radio observations to find weakly-accreting central black holes.",1

124712,0,"Widefield lensless endoscopy via speckle-correlations Flexible fiber-optic endoscopes provide a minimally-invasive solution for imaging at depths beyond the reach of conventional microscopes. Current endoscopes require focusing and/or scanning mechanisms at the distal end, which limit miniaturization and frame-rate, and induce aberrations. Alternative lensless solutions are based on adaptive wavefront-correction, but are extremely sensitive to fiber bending. Here, we demonstrate a novel endoscopic approach, which enables single-shot imaging at a variable working distance through a conventional fiber bundle, without the use of any distal optics. Our approach computationally retrieves the object image from a single speckle pattern transmitted through the bundle, exploiting phase information preserved through inherent angular speckle correlations. Unlike conventional fiber-bundle endoscopes, the resulting image is unpixelated, the resolution is diffraction-limited, objects can be imaged at variable working distance, and the technique is completely insensitive to fiber bending. Since no optical elements are required, miniaturization is limited only by the bundle diameter.",1
124764,0,"Radon induced hyperplasia: effective adaptation reducing the local doses in the bronchial epithelium There is experimental and histological evidence that chronic irritation and cell death may cause hyperplasia in the exposed tissue. As the heterogeneous deposition of inhaled radon progeny results in high local doses at the peak of the bronchial bifurcations, it was proposed earlier that hyperplasia occurs in these deposition hot spots upon chronic radon exposure. The objective of the present study is to quantify how the induction of basal cell hyperplasia modulates the microdosimetric consequences of a given radon exposure. For this purpose, numerical epithelium models were generated with spherical cell nuclei of six different cell types based on histological data. Basal cell hyperplasia was modelled by epithelium models with additional basal cells and increased epithelium thickness. Microdosimetry for alpha-particles was performed by an own-developed Monte-Carlo code. Results show that the average tissue dose, and the average hit number and dose of basal cells decrease by the increase of the measure of hyperplasia. Hit and dose distribution reveal that the induction of hyperplasia may result in a basal cell pool which is shielded from alpha radiation. It highlights that the exposure history affects the microdosimetric consequences of a present exposure, while the biological and health effects may also depend on previous exposures. The induction of hyperplasia can be considered as a radioadaptive response at the tissue level. Such an adaptation of the tissue challenges the validity of the application of the dose dose rate effectiveness factor from a mechanistic point of view. As the location of radiosensitive target cells may change due to previous exposures, dosimetry models considering the tissue geometry characteristic of normal conditions may be inappropriate for dose estimation in case of protracted exposures. As internal exposures are frequently chronic, such changes in tissue...",1

The phase transition from the trivial $C=4$ phase into the intermediate phase with $C=3$ is seen in the real-space calculation of the Chern number.

125287,0,"Hilbert space renormalization for the many-electron problem Renormalization is a powerful concept in the many-body problem. Inspired by the highly successful density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, and the quantum chemical graphical representation of configuration space, we introduce a new theoretical tool: Hilbert space renormalization, to describe many-electron correlations. While in DMRG, the many-body states in nested Fock subspaces are successively renormalized, in Hilbert space renormalization, many-body states in nested Hilbert subspaces undergo renormalization. This provides a new way to classify and combine configurations. The underlying wavefunction ansatz, namely the Hilbert space matrix product state (HS-MPS), has a very rich and flexible mathematical structure. It provides low-rank tensor approximations to any configuration interaction (CI) space through restricting either the 'physical indices' or the coupling rules in the HS-MPS. Alternatively, simply truncating the 'virtual dimension' of the HS-MPS leads to a family of size-extensive wave function ansaetze that can be used efficiently in variational calculations. We make formal and numerical comparisons between the HS-MPS, the traditional Fock-space MPS used in DMRG, and traditional CI approximations. The analysis and results shed light on fundamental aspects of the efficient representation of many-electron wavefunctions through the renormalization of many-body states.",1
125344,0,"Nonequilibrium many-body steady states via Keldysh formalism Many-body systems with both coherent dynamics and dissipation constitute a rich class of models which are nevertheless much less explored than their dissipationless counterparts. The advent of numerous experimental platforms that simulate such dynamics poses an immediate challenge to systematically understand and classify these models. In particular, nontrivial many-body states emerge as steady states under non-equilibrium dynamics. While these states and their phase transitions have been studied extensively with mean field theory, the validity of the mean field approximation has not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we employ a field-theoretic approach based on the Keldysh formalism to study nonequilibrium phases and phase transitions in a variety of models. In all cases, a complete description via the Keldysh formalism indicates a partial or complete failure of the mean field analysis. Furthermore, we find that an effective temperature emerges as a result of dissipation, and the universal behavior including the dynamics near the steady state is generically described by a thermodynamic universality class.",1

In the literature, there is no process that allows the direct measurement of the internal radiation dose received by a person. The luminescence counts from a blood sample having a laboratory-injected radiation dose and the waste blood of the patient injected with a radiopharmaceutical for diagnostic purposes were both measured. The decay and dose-response curves were plotted for the different doses. The doses received by the different blood aliquots can be determined by interpolating the luminescence counts to the dose-response curve. This study shows that the dose received by a person can be measured directly, simply and retrospectively by using only a very small amount of blood sample. The results will have important ramifications for the medicine and healthcare fields in particular.

Due to the strong spin-orbit interaction and confining potential the metal disk is described by an effective one dimensional with a harmonic potential. The harmonic potential gives rise to classical turning points. As a result open boundary conditions must be used. We Bosonize the model and obtain chiral Bosons for each spin on the edge of the disk. When the filling fraction is reduced to $\nu=\frac{k_{F}}{k_{so}}=\frac{1}{3}$ the electron- electron interactions are studied using the Jordan Wigner phase for composite fermions which gives rise to a Luttinger liquid.

For this definition, we combine three moduli spaces corresponding to three possible types of involutions on a symplectic torus, by gluing them along common boundaries, to get a moduli space without codimension-one boundary and then study orientation of the total space. Modulo a technical conjectural lemma, we can prove that the result is an invariant of the corresponding real symplectic manifold.

125752,0,"Tidal Debris as a Dark Matter Probe Tidal debris streams from galaxy satellites can provide insight into the dark matter distribution in halos. This is because we have more information about stars in a debris structure than about a purely random population of stars: we know that in the past they were all bound to the same dwarf galaxy; and we know that they form a dynamically cold population moving on similar orbits. They also probe a different region of the matter distribution in a galaxy than many other methods of mass determination, as their orbits take them far beyond the typical extent of those for the bulk of stars. Although conclusive results from this information have yet to be obtained, significant progress has been made in developing the methodologies for determining both the global mass distribution of the Milky Way's dark matter halo and the amount of dark matter substructure within it. Methods for measuring the halo shape are divided into ""predictive methods,"" which predict the tidal debris properties from the progenitor satellite's mass and orbit, given an assumed parent galaxy mass distribution; and ""fundamental methods,"" which exploit properties fundamental to the nature of tidal debris as global potential constraints.

At weak disorder, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is fulfilled on average, making local observables smooth functions of energy, whose eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations decrease exponentially with system size. We demonstrate the validity of ETH in the thermal phase as well as its breakdown in the localized phase and show that rare states exist which do not strictly follow ETH, becoming more frequent closer to the transition. Similarly, the probability distribution of the entanglement entropy at intermediate disorder develops long tails all the way down to zero entanglement. We propose that these low entanglement tails stem from localized regions at the subsystem boundaries which were recently discussed as a possible mechanism for subdiffusive transport in the ergodic phase.",1
126014,0,"Is the central binary system of the planetary nebula Henize 2-428 a Type Ia supernova progenitor? We critically discuss the recent observations of the binary system at the center of the bipolar planetary nebula Henize 2-428. We find that the proposed explanation of two equal-mass degenerate objects with a total mass larger than the Chandrasekhar limiting mass that supposedly will merge in less than a Hubble time, possibly leading to a SN~Ia, is controversial. This hypothesis relies on the assumption that the variability of the He II 5412A spectral line is due to two absorption components. Instead, we propose that it can be accounted for by a broad absorption line from the central system on top of which there is a narrow emission line from the nebula. This prompted us to study if the binary system can be made of a degenerate star and a low-mass main sequence companion, or of two degenerate objects of smaller mass. We find that although both scenarios can account for the existence of two symmetric broad minima in the light curve, the second one agrees better with observations. We thus argue that the claim that Henize 2-428 provides observational evidence supporting the double-degenerate scenario for SN~Ia is premature.",1
126061,0,"A Short Course on Topological Insulators: Band-structure topology and edge states in one and two dimensions This course-based primer provides newcomers to the field with a concise introduction to some of the core topics in the emerging field of topological band insulators in one and two dimensions. The aim is to provide a basic understanding of edge states, bulk topological invariants, and of the bulk--boundary correspondence with as simple mathematical tools as possible. We use noninteracting lattice models of topological insulators, building gradually on these to arrive from the simplest one-dimensional case (the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for polyacetylene) to two-dimensional time-reversal invariant topological insulators (the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for HgTe). In each case the model is introduced first and then its properties are discussed and subsequently generalized. The only prerequisite for the reader is a working knowledge in quantum mechanics, the relevant solid state physics background is provided as part of this self-contained text, which is complemented by end-of-chapter problems.",1
126328,0,"A supernova feedback implementation for the astrophysical simulation software Arepo Supernova (SN) explosions play an important role in the development of galactic structures. The energy and momentum imparted on the interstellar medium (ISM) in so-called ""supernova feedback"" drives turbulence, heats the gas, enriches it with heavy elements, can lead to the formation of new stars or even suppress star formation by disrupting stellar nurseries. In the numerical simulation at the sub-galactic level, not including the energy and momentum of supernovas in the physical description of the problem can also lead to several problems that might partially be resolved by including a description of supernovas. In this thesis such an implementation is attempted for the combined numerical hydrodynamics and N-body simulation software Arepo (Springel, 2010) for the high density gas in the ISM only. This allows supernova driven turbulence in boxes of 400pc cubed to be studied. In a stochastic process a large amount of thermal energy is imparted on a number of neighbouring cells, mimicking the effect of a supernova explosions. We test this approach by modelling the explosion of a single supernova in a uniform density medium and comparing the evolution of the resulting supernova remnant to the theoretically-predicted behaviour. We also run a simulation with our feedback code and a fixed supernova rate derived from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (Kennicutt, 1998) for a duration of about 20 Myrs. We describe our method in detail in this text and discuss the properties of our implementation. vii",1
126344,0,"Super-resolution photoacoustic fluctuation imaging with multiple speckle illumination In deep tissue photoacoustic imaging, the spatial resolution is inherently limited by acoustic diffraction. Moreover, as the ultrasound attenuation increases with frequency, resolution is often traded-off for penetration depth. Here we report on super-resolution photoacoustic imaging by use of multiple speckle illumination. Specifically, we show that the analysis of second-order fluctuations of the photoacoustic images combined with image deconvolution enables resolving optically absorbing structures beyond the acoustic diffraction limit. A resolution increase of almost a factor 2 is demonstrated experimentally. Our method introduces a new framework that could potentially lead to deep tissue photoacoustic imaging with sub-acoustic resolution.",1
126827,0,"Electroluminescence from nitrogen-vacancy and interstitial-related centers in bulk diamond stimulated by ion-beam-fabricated sub-superficial graphitic micro-electrodes We report on the fabrication and characterization of a single-crystal diamond device for the electrical stimula- tion of light emission from nitrogen-vacancy (NV0) and other defect-related centers. Pairs of sub-superficial graphitic micro-electrodes embedded in insulating diamond were fabricated by a 6 MeV C3+ micro-beam irra- diation followed by thermal annealing. A photoluminescence (PL) characterization evidenced a low radiation damage concentration in the inter-electrode gap region, which did not significantly affect the PL features domi- nated by NV centers. The operation of the device in electroluminescence (EL) regime was investigated by ap- plying a bias voltage at the graphitic electrodes, resulting in the injection of a high excitation current above a threshold voltage (~300V), which effectively stimulated an intense EL emission from NV0 centers. In addition, we report on the new observation of two additional sharp EL emission lines (at 563 nm and 580 nm) related to interstitial defects formed during MeV ion beam fabrication.",1
126889,0,"MoonGen: A Scriptable High-Speed Packet Generator We present MoonGen, a flexible high-speed packet generator. It can saturate 10 GbE links with minimum sized packets using only a single CPU core by running on top of the packet processing framework DPDK. Linear multi-core scaling allows for even higher rates: We have tested MoonGen with up to 178.5 Mpps at 120 Gbit/s. We move the whole packet generation logic into user-controlled Lua scripts to achieve the highest possible flexibility. In addition, we utilize hardware features of Intel NICs that have not been used for packet generators previously. A key feature is the measurement of latency with sub-microsecond precision and accuracy by using hardware timestamping capabilities of modern commodity NICs. We address timing issues with software-based packet generators and apply methods to mitigate them with both hardware support on commodity NICs and with a novel method to control the inter-packet gap in software. Features that were previously only possible with hardware-based solutions are now provided by MoonGen on commodity hardware.

126897,0,"Constraining ultra-compact dwarf galaxy formation with galaxy clusters in the local universe We compare the predictions of a semi-analytic model for ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD) formation by tidal stripping to the observed properties of globular clusters (GCs) and UCDs in the Fornax and Virgo clusters. For Fornax we find the predicted number of stripped nuclei agrees very well with the excess number of GCs$+$UCDs above the GC luminosity function. GCs$+$UCDs with masses $&gt;10^{7.3}$ M$_\odot$ are consistent with being entirely formed by tidal stripping. Stripped nuclei can also account for Virgo UCDs with masses $&gt;10^{7.3}$ M$_\odot$ where numbers are complete by mass. For both Fornax and Virgo, the predicted velocity dispersions and radial distributions of stripped nuclei are consistent with that of UCDs within $\sim$50-100 kpc but disagree at larger distances where dispersions are too high and radial distributions too extended. Stripped nuclei are predicted to have radially biased anisotropies at all radii, agreeing with Virgo UCDs at clustercentric distances larger than 50 kpc. However, ongoing disruption is not included in our model which would cause orbits to become tangentially biased at small radii. We find the predicted metallicities and central black hole masses of stripped nuclei agree well with the metallicities and implied black hole masses of UCDs for masses $&gt;10^{6.5}$ M$_\odot$. The predicted black hole masses also agree well with that of M60-UCD1, the first UCD with a confirmed central black hole. These results suggest that observed GC$+$UCD populations are a combination of genuine GCs and stripped nuclei, with the contribution of stripped nuclei increasing toward the high-mass end.",1
126956,0,"Measuring the second order correlation function and the coherence time using random phase modulation A new approach to measure the second order correlation function $g^{(2)}$ and the coherence time was investigated. The $g^{(2)}$ was calculated from the photon pair time interval distribution by direct numerical self-convolution with the high order correction. The accuracy of this method was examined using an optical fiber based Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometer with a pseudo-thermal light source. We found that the significance of the high order correction is related to the factor $\bar{I}\tau_{c}$, which is the overlapping of the photon wave packets. A novel technique was also demonstrated to measure the coherence time $\tau_c$ of a light source using the random phase modulation. In comparison with the conventional self-heterodyne detection, this method is more suitable for a weak light source with a long coherence time.",1

More precisely, we show that their symplectic cohomology can be equipped with the structure of a so-called cohomology F-manifold.

127442,0,"Operator Approach to the Master Equation for the One-Step Process Presentation of the probability as an intrinsic property of the nature leads researchers to switch from deterministic to stochastic description of the phenomena. The procedure of stochastization of one-step process was formulated. It allows to write down the master equation based on the type of of the kinetic equations and assumptions about the nature of the process. The kinetics of the interaction has recently attracted attention because it often occurs in the physical, chemical, technical, biological, environmental, economic, and sociological systems. However, there are no general methods for the direct study of this equation. Leaving in the expansion terms up to the second order we can get the Fokker-Planck equation, and thus the Langevin equation. It should be clearly understood that these equations are approximate recording of the master equation. However, this does not eliminate the need for the study of the master equation. Moreover, the power series produced during the master equation decomposition may be divergent (for example, in spatial models). This makes it impossible to apply the classical perturbation theory. It is proposed to use quantum field perturbation theory for the statistical systems (the so-called Doi method). This work is a methodological material that describes the principles of master equation solution based on quantum field perturbation theory methods. The characteristic property of the work is that it is intelligible for non-specialists in quantum field theory. As an example the Verhulst model is used because of its simplicity and clarity (the first order equation is independent of the spatial variables, however, contains non-linearity). We show the full equivalence of the operator and combinatorial methods of obtaining and study of the one-step process master equation.",1

127599,0,"A potential-splitting approach applied to the Temkin-Poet model for electron scattering off the hydrogen atom and the helium ion The study of scattering processes in few body systems is a difficult problem especially if long range interactions are involved. In order to solve such problems, we develop here a potential-splitting approach for three body systems. This approach is based on splitting the reaction potential into a finite range core part and a long range tail part. The solution to the Schr\""odinger equation for the long range tail Hamiltonian is found analytically, and used as an incoming wave in the three body scattering problem. This reformulation of the scattering problem makes it suitable for treatment by the exterior complex scaling technique in the sense that the problem after the complex dilation is reduced to a boundary value problem with zero boundary conditions. We illustrate the method with calculations on the electron scattering off the hydrogen atom and the positive helium ion in the frame of the Temkin-Poet model.",1
127638,0,"Learning to Remove Multipath Distortions in Time-of-Flight Range Images for a Robotic Arm Setup Range images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras are corrupted with multipath distortions due to interaction between modulated light signals and scenes. The interaction is often complicated, which makes a model-based solution elusive. We propose a learning-based approach for removing the multipath distortions for a ToF camera in a robotic arm setup. Our approach is based on deep learning. We use the robotic arm to automatically collect a large amount of ToF range images containing various multipath distortions. The training images are automatically labeled by leveraging a high precision structured light sensor available only in the training time. In the test time, we apply the learned model to remove the multipath distortions. This allows our robotic arm setup to enjoy the speed and compact form of the ToF camera without compromising with its range measurement errors. We conduct extensive experimental validations and compare the proposed method to several baseline algorithms. The experiment results show that our method achieves 55% error reduction in range estimation and largely outperforms the baseline algorithms.",1

We find that depending on the initial and final interaction strength, the quenched system either exhibits undamped oscillations or relaxes to a time independent steady state. The time averaged expectation value of the CDW order parameter rises sharply when crossing from the steady state regime to the oscillating regime, indicating that the system, being non-integrable, shows signs of thermalization with an effective temperature above or below the equilibrium critical temperature, respectively.",1

128112,0,"Method for Computation of the Fisher Information Matrix in the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative computational method to calculate the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) from the sample data. It converts a complicated one-time calculation for the MLE of the incomplete data to a series of relatively simple calculations for the MLEs of the complete data. When the MLE is available, we naturally want the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of unknown parameters. The FIM is, in fact, a good measure of the amount of information a sample of data provides and can be used to determine the lower bound of the variance and the asymptotic variance of the estimators. However, one of the limitations of the EM is that the FIM is not an automatic by-product of the algorithm. In this paper, we review some basic ideas of the EM and the FIM. Then we construct a simple Monte Carlo-based method requiring only the gradient values of the function we obtain from the E step and basic operations. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and numerical examples to show the efficiency of our method. The key part of our method is to utilize the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation method to approximate the Hessian matrix from the gradient of the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function.

128184,0,"The dearth of nuclear star clusters in bright galaxies We investigate the interaction of a massive globular cluster (GC) with a super massive black hole (SMBH), located at the centre of its host galaxy, by means of direct N-body simulations. The results show that tidal distortions induced by the stellar background and the SMBH act on a time shorter than that of dynamical friction decay for a $10^6$ M$_\odot$ GC whenever the SMBH mass exceeds $\sim 10^8$ M$_\odot$ . This implies an almost complete dissolution of the infalling GC before it reaches the inner region ($\lesssim 5$ pc) of the parent galaxy. The generalization of this result to a larger sample of infalling GCs shows that such destructive process may prevent the formation and growth of a bright galactic nucleus. Another interesting, serendipitous, result we obtained is that the close interaction between the SMBH and the GC produces a ""wave"" of stars that escape from the cluster and, in a fraction, even from the whole galaxy.",1

We argue that the ICM of the cooling flow galaxy group NGC 5813 is more likely to be heated by mixing of post-shock jets' gas residing in hot bubbles with the ICM, than by shocks or turbulent-heating. Shocks thermalize only a small fraction of their energy in the inner regions of the cooling flow; in order to adequately heat the inner part of the ICM, they would overheat the outer regions by a large factor, leading to its ejection from the group. Heating by mixing, that was found to be much more efficient than turbulent-heating and shocks-heating, hence, rescues the outer ICM of NGC 5813 from its predestined fate according to cooling flow feedback scenarios that are based on heating by shocks.",1
128575,0,"X-ray echo spectroscopy X-ray echo spectroscopy, a counterpart of neutron spin-echo, is being introduced here to overcome limitations in spectral resolution and weak signals of the traditional inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) probes. An image of a point-like x-ray source is defocused by a dispersing system comprised of asymmetrically cut specially arranged Bragg diffracting crystals. The defocused image is refocused into a point (echo) in a time-reversal dispersing system. If the defocused beam is inelastically scattered from a sample, the echo signal acquires a spatial distribution, which is a map of the inelastic scattering spectrum. The spectral resolution of the echo spectroscopy does not rely on the monochromaticity of the x-rays, ensuring strong signals along with a very high spectral resolution. Particular schemes of x-ray echo spectrometers for 0.1--0.02-meV ultra-high-resolution IXS applications (resolving power $&gt; 10^8$) with broadband $\simeq$~5--13~meV dispersing systems are introduced featuring more than $10^3$ signal enhancement.

128770,0,"Interpolated-DFT-Based Fast and Accurate Amplitude and Phase Estimation for the Control of Power The quality of energy produced in renewable energy systems has to be at the high level specified by respective standards and directives. The estimation accuracy of grid signal parameters is one of the most important factors affecting this quality. This paper presents a method for a very fast and accurate amplitude and phase grid signal estimation using the Fast Fourier Transform procedure and maximum decay sidelobes windows. The most important features of the method are the elimination of the impact associated with the conjugate's component on the results and the straightforward implementation. Moreover, the measurement time is very short - even far less than one period of the grid signal. The influence of harmonics on the results is reduced by using a bandpass prefilter. Even using a 40 dB FIR prefilter for the grid signal with THD = 38%, SNR = 53 dB and a 20-30% slow decay exponential drift the maximum error of the amplitude estimation is approximately 1% and approximately 0.085 rad of the phase estimation in a real-time DSP system for 512 samples.

During its process towards localization, it was found that the electronic states will be directly localized to an Anderson insulator (with Chern number 0), without an intermediate Hall plateau with Chern number 1. Here we investigate the topological origin of this phenomenon, by calculating the band structures and Chern numbers for disordered supercells. We find that on the route towards localization, there exists a hidden state with Chern number 1, but it is too short and too fluctuating to be practically observable. This intermediate state cannot be stabilized even after some ""smart design"" of the model and this should be a universal phenomena for insulators with high Chern numbers. By performing numerical scaling of conductances, we also plot the renormalization group flows for this transition, with Chern number 1 state as an unstable fixed point. This is distinct from known results, and can be tested by experiments and further theoretical analysis.",1

The time evolution of plasma intensity shows that a homogeneous plasma breaks into several concentric radial spatiotemoral bright and dark rings. These rings propagate radially at considerably low pressure and a constant magnetic field. These patterns are observed to trap small dust particles/grains in their potential. Exploiting this property of the patterns, a novel technique to measure the electric field associated with the patterns is described.

129076,0,"Space-based Aperture Array For Ultra-Long Wavelength Radio Astronomy The past decade has seen the rise of various radio astronomy arrays, particularly for low-frequency observations below 100MHz. These developments have been primarily driven by interesting and fundamental scientific questions, such as studying the dark ages and epoch of re-ionization, by detecting the highly red-shifted 21cm line emission. However, Earth-based radio astronomy below frequencies of 30MHz is severely restricted due to man-made interference, ionospheric distortion and almost complete non-transparency of the ionosphere below 10MHz. Therefore, this narrow spectral band remains possibly the last unexplored frequency range in radio astronomy. A straightforward solution to study the universe at these frequencies is to deploy a space-based antenna array far away from Earths' ionosphere. Various studies in the past were principally limited by technology and computing resources, however current processing and communication trends indicate otherwise. We briefly present the achievable science cases, and discuss the system design for selected scenarios, such as extra-galactic surveys. An extensive discussion is presented on various sub-systems of the potential satellite array, such as radio astronomical antenna design, the on-board signal processing, communication architectures and joint space-time estimation of the satellite network. In light of a scalable array and to avert single point of failure, we propose both centralized and distributed solutions for the ULW space-based array. We highlight the benefits of various deployment locations and summarize the technological challenges for future space-based radio arrays.",1
129077,0,"Reduction of Ion Heating During Magnetic Reconnection by Large-Scale Effective Potentials The physical processes that control the partition of released magnetic energy between electrons and ions during reconnection is explored through particle-in-cell simulations and analytical techniques. We demonstrate that the development of a large-scale parallel electric field and its associated potential controls the relative heating of electrons and ions. The potential develops to restrain heated exhaust electrons and enhances their heating by confining electrons in the region where magnetic energy is released. Simultaneously the potential slows ions entering the exhaust below the Alfv\'enic speed expected from the traditional counterstreaming picture of ion heating. Unexpectedly, the magnitude of the potential and therefore the relative partition of energy between electrons and ions is not a constant but rather depends on the upstream parameters and specifically the upstream electron normalized temperature (electron beta). These findings suggest that the fraction of magnetic energy converted into the total thermal energy may be independent of upstream parameters.",1

A relational-presheaf is a relational-sheaf, if it is an idempotent infima-preserving lax semifunctor. The associated relational-sheaf functor factors through the category of sheaves for ${\cal H}$. Using this and the appropriate comparison theorems we obtain the main result that the associated categories of relational-presheaves and relational-sheaves are each respectively equivalent to the categories of presheaves and sheaves for ${\cal H}$.",1

129303,0,"Projective symmetry group classification of chiral spin liquids We present a general review of the projective symmetry group classification of fermionic quantum spin liquids for lattice models of spin $S=1/2$. We then introduce a systematic generalization of the approach for symmetric $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids to the one of chiral phases (i.e., singlet states that break time reversal and lattice reflection, but conserve their product). We apply this framework to classify and discuss possible chiral spin liquids on triangular and kagome lattices. We give a detailed prescription on how to construct quadratic spinon Hamiltonians and microscopic wave functions for each representation class on these lattices. Among the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2$ states, we study the subset of U(1) phases variationally in the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_d$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. We discuss static spin structure factors and symmetry constraints on the bulk spectra of these phases.",1
129367,0,"Multi-band morpho-Spectral Component Analysis Deblending Tool (MuSCADeT): Deblending colourful objects We introduce a new algorithm for colour separation and deblending of multi-band astronomical images called MuSCADeT which is based on Morpho-spectral Component Analysis of multi-band images. The MuSCADeT algorithm takes advantage of the sparsity of astronomical objects in morphological dictionaries such as wavelets and their differences in spectral energy distribution (SED) across multi-band observations. This allows us to devise a model independent and automated approach to separate objects with different colours. We show with simulations that we are able to separate highly blended objects and that our algorithm is robust against SED variations of objects across the field of view. To confront our algorithm with real data, we use HST images of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS J1149+2223 and we show that MuSCADeT performs better than traditional profile-fitting techniques in deblending the foreground lensing galaxies from background lensed galaxies. Although the main driver for our work is the deblending of strong gravitational lenses, our method is fit to be used for any purpose related to deblending of objects in astronomical images. An example of such an application is the separation of the red and blue stellar populations of a spiral galaxy in the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. We provide a python package along with all simulations and routines used in this paper to contribute to reproducible research efforts. Codes can be found at http://lastro.epfl.ch/page-126973.html.",1
129482,0,"Parabolic Anderson model in a dynamic random environment: random conductances The parabolic Anderson model is defined as the partial differential equation \partial u(x,t)/\partial t = \kappa\Delta u(x,t) + \xi(x,t)u(x,t), x\in\Z^d, t\geq 0, where \kappa \in [0,\infty) is the diffusion constant, \Delta is the discrete Laplacian, and \xi is a dynamic random environment that drives the equation. The initial condition u(x,0)=u_0(x), x\in\Z^d, is taken to be non-negative and bounded. The solution of the parabolic Anderson equation describes the evolution of a field of particles performing independent simple random walks with binary branching: particles jump at rate 2d\kappa, split into two at rate \xi \vee 0, and die at rate (-\xi) \vee 0. Our focus is on the Lyapunov exponents \lambda_p(\kappa) = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{t} \log \E([u(0,t)]^p)^{1/p}, p \in \N, and \lambda_0(\kappa) = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{t}\log u(0,t). We investigate what happens when \kappa\Delta is replaced by \Delta^\cK, where \cK = \{\mathcal{K}(x,y)\colon\,x,y\in\Z^d,\,x \sim y\} is a collection of random conductances between neighbouring sites replacing the constant conductances \kappa in the homogeneous model. We show that the associated annealed Lyapunov exponents are given by the formula \lambda_p(\cK) = \sup\{\lambda_p(\kappa) \colon\,\kappa\in\Supp(\cK)\}, where \Supp(\cK) is the set of values taken by the \cK-field. We also show that for the associated quenched Lyapunov exponent this formula only provides a lower bound. Our proof is valid for three classes of reversible \xi, and for all \cK satisfying a certain clustering property, namely, there are arbitrarily large balls where \cK is almost constant and close to any value in \Supp(\cK). What our result says is that the Lyapunov exponents are controlled by those pockets of \cK where the conductances are close to the value that maximises the growth in the homogeneous setting.",1

By using a method inspired by quantum mechanics, and which consist on the deformation of the phase space coordinates of the harmonic oscillator, we generalize the equation of motion of the classical linear harmonic oscillator to several classes of strongly non-linear differential equations. The first integrals, and a number of exact solutions of the corresponding equations are explicitly obtained. The devised method can be further generalized to derive explicit general solutions of nonlinear second order differential equations unrelated to the harmonic oscillator.

129580,0,"High-Redshift Galaxy Surveys and the Reionization of the Universe Star-forming galaxies in the early universe provide us with perhaps the most natural way of explaining the reionization of the universe. Current observational results are sufficiently comprehensive, as to allow us to approximately calculate how the ionizing radiation from galaxies varies as a function of cosmic time. Important uncertainties in modeling reionization by galaxies revolve around the escape fraction and its luminosity and redshift dependence, a possible truncation of the galaxy luminosity function at the faint end, and an evolution in the production efficiency of Lyman-continuum photons with cosmic time. Despite these uncertainties, plausible choices for these parameters naturally predict a cosmic ionizing emissivity at z~6-10 whose evolution and overall normalization is in excellent agreement with that derived from current observational constraints. This strongly suggests that galaxies provide the necessary photons to reionize the universe.",1

In the case of the beta- decay in the Li atom into Be+ ion we compare the numerical values of the transition probabilities from the S-, P-, D-low-lying states of the initial atom and final ion calculated using both Hylleraas-Configuration Interaction (Hy-CI) and Configuration Interaction (CI) with Slater orbitals wave functions. In addition using the CI method the transition probabilities from F, G, H and I low-lying states have been calculated. The average of the absolute deviation of the transition probabilities distribution for low-lying S-states is &lt;0.15%, for P-states &lt;0.5%, and larger for D- and higher energy states. The numerical results demonstrate that for low-lying states the atomic effect parameters in beta-decay can be calculated with sufficient accuracy using CI wave functions constructed with Slater orbitals. This result opens a new avenue for the accurate calculation of atomic effects during the beta-decay in heavier atoms and molecules.",1

We prove that it is given to leading order by the ground state energy of the Pekar-Tomasevich functional with Fermionic statistics, which is a much simpler model. Our main theorem is new because none of the previous results on the strong coupling limit have taken into account the Fermionic statistics and the spin of the electrons. A binding result for Fr\""ohlich multipolarons is a corollary of our main theorem combined with the binding result for multipolarons in the Pekar-Tomasevich model by the first author and Griesemer in [AG14]. Our analysis strongly relies on the work of Wellig [Well15] which in turn used and generalized methods developed by Lieb and Thomas [LT97], Frank, Lieb, Seiringer and Thomas [FLST11] and Griesemer and Wellig [GW13]. In order to take the Fermionic statistics into account, we employ a localization method given by Lieb and Loss in [LL05].",1

Specifically, we study the eta invariant on nilmanifolds by decomposing the spin Dirac operator using Kirillov theory. In particular, for general Heisenberg three-manifolds, the spectrum of the Dirac operator and the eta invariant are computed in terms of the metric, lattice, and spin structure data. There are continuous families of geometrically, spectrally different Heisenberg three-manifolds whose Dirac operators have constant eta invariant. In the appendix, some needed results of L.

This new ultrafast time-resolved capability is then applied to a fluence-dependent study of all-optical magnetic switching dynamics of Fe and Gd magnetic sublattices in a GdFeCo thin film above its magnetization compensation temperature. At the magnetic switching fuence, we corroborate the existence of a transient ferromagnetic-like state. The timescales of the dynamics, however, are longer than previously observed below the magnetization compensation temperature. Above and below the switching fluence range, we observe secondary demagnetization with about 5 ps timescales. This indicates that the spin thermalization takes longer than 5 ps.",1

130334,0,"A population of intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf starburst galaxies up to redshift=1.5 We study a sample of $\sim$50,000 dwarf starburst and late-type galaxies drawn from the COSMOS survey with the aim of investigating the presence of nuclear accreting black holes (BHs) as those seed BHs from which supermassive BHs could grow in the early Universe. We divide the sample into five complete redshift bins up to $z=1.5$ and perform an X-ray stacking analysis using the \textit{Chandra} COSMOS-Legacy survey data. After removing the contribution from X-ray binaries and hot gas to the stacked X-ray emission, we still find an X-ray excess in the five redshift bins that can be explained by nuclear accreting BHs. This X-ray excess is more significant for $z&lt;0.5$. At higher redshifts, these active galactic nuclei could suffer mild obscuration, as indicated by the analysis of their hardness ratios. The average nuclear X-ray luminosities in the soft band are in the range 10$^{39}-10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Assuming that the sources accrete at $\geq$ 1\% the Eddington rate, their BH masses would be $\leq$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, thus in the intermediate-mass BH regime, but their mass would be smaller than the one predicted by the BH-stellar mass relation. If instead the sources follow the correlation between BH mass and stellar mass, they would have sub-Eddington accreting rates of $\sim$ 10$^{-3}$ and BH masses 1-9 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We thus conclude that a population of intermediate-mass BHs exists in dwarf starburst galaxies, at least up to $z$=1.5, though their detection beyond the local Universe is challenging due to their low luminosity and mild obscuration unless deep surveys are employed.",1
130359,0,"Fundamental Asymmetry in Quenches Between Integrable and Nonintegrable Systems We study quantum quenches between integrable and nonintegrable hard-core boson models in the thermodynamic limit with numerical linked cluster expansions. We show that while quenches in which the initial state is a thermal equilibrium state of an integrable model and the final Hamiltonian is nonintegrable (quantum chaotic) lead to thermalization, the reverse is not true. While this might appear counterintuitive given the fact that the eigenstates of both Hamiltonians are related by a unitary transformation, we argue that it is generic. Hence, the lack of thermalization of integrable systems is robust against quenches starting from stationary states of nonintegrable ones. Nonintegrable systems thermalize independently of the nature of the initial Hamiltonian.",1

The advent of ALMA enables us to reveal millimeter-wavelength number counts down to the faint end without source confusion. However, previous studies are based on the ensemble of serendipitously-detected sources in fields originally targeting different sources and could be biased due to the clustering of sources around the targets. We derive number counts in the flux range of 0.2-2 mJy by using 23 (&gt;=4sigma) sources detected in a continuous 2.0 arcmin$^2$ area of the SXDF. The number counts are consistent with previous results within errors, suggesting that the counts derived from serendipitously-detected sources are not significantly biased, although there could be field-to-field variation due to the small survey area. By using the best-fit function of the number counts, we find that ~40% of the extragalactic background light at 1.1 mm is resolved at S(1.1mm) &gt; 0.2 mJy.",1

Real-body radiation The general analytical expressions for the thermal radiative and thermodynamic properties of a real-body are obtained in a finite range of frequencies at different temperatures.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law, total energy density, number density of photons, Helmholtz free energy density, internal energy density, enthalpy density, entropy density, heat capacity at constant volume, pressure, and total emissivity are expressed in terms of the polylogarithm functions. The general expressions for the thermal radiative and thermodynamic functions are applied for the study of thermal radiation of liquid and solid zirconium carbide. These functions are calculated using experimental data for the frequency dependence of the normal spectral emissivity in the visible-near infrared range at the melting (freezing) point. The gaps between the thermal radiative and thermodynamic functions of liquid and solid zirconium carbide are observed. The general analytical expressions obtained can easily be presented in wavenumber domain.",1

130509,0,"Quantum phase transitions of topological insulators without gap closing We consider two-dimensional Chern insulators and time-reversal invariant topological insulators and discuss the effect of perturbations breaking either particle-number conservation or time-reversal symmetry. The appearance of trivial mass terms is expected to cause quantum phase transitions into trivial phases when such a perturbation overweights the topological term. These phase transitions are usually associated with a bulk-gap closing. In contrast, the chiral Chern insulator is unaffected by particle-number breaking perturbations. Moreover, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator undergoes phase transitions into topologically trivial phases without bulk-gap closing in the presence of any of such perturbations. In certain cases, these phase transitions can be circumvented and the protection restored by another U(1) symmetry, e.g. due to spin conservation. These findings are discussed in the context of interacting topological insulators.",1

The presented approach is valid in both non-relativistic and relativistic cases. It allows using arbitrary systems of coordinates for description of the particle distribution. In some cases, making use of special coordinates gives possibility to construct analytical solutions.

The relationship is widely believed to be driven by the internal star formation activity. Radio emission from these galaxies are predominantly produced from the synchrotron emission of cosmic-ray electrons accelerated in supernova shocks. The infrared emission is due to ultraviolet light from young massive stars that is absorbed and re-radiated by dust [3]. A correlation is found also in local clusters but cluster galaxies appears to have excess radio emission relative to the amount of far-infrared emission [9, 13, 11]. In this work, we measure the far-infrared-radio relationship in a massive cluster to test how this relationship changes at intermediate z between the field and a high-density cluster environment.",1
130578,0,"An Empirical Relation Between The Large-Scale Magnetic Field And The Dynamical Mass In Galaxies The origin and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields as well as the influence of the magnetic fields on the evolution of galaxies are unknown. Though not without challenges, the dynamo theory can explain the large-scale coherent magnetic fields which govern galaxies, but observational evidence for the theory is so far very scarce. Putting together the available data of non-interacting, non-cluster galaxies with known large-scale magnetic fields, we find a tight correlation between the integrated polarized flux density, S(PI), and the rotation speed, v(rot), of galaxies. This leads to an almost linear correlation between the large-scale magnetic field B and v(rot), assuming that the number of cosmic ray electrons is proportional to the star formation rate, and a super-linear correlation assuming equipartition between magnetic fields and cosmic rays. This correlation cannot be attributed to an active linear alpha-Omega dynamo, as no correlation holds with global shear or angular speed. It indicates instead a coupling between the large-scale magnetic field and the dynamical mass of the galaxies, B ~ M^(0.25-0.4). Hence, faster rotating and/or more massive galaxies have stronger large-scale magnetic fields. The observed B-v(rot) correlation shows that the anisotropic turbulent magnetic field dominates B in fast rotating galaxies as the turbulent magnetic field, coupled with gas, is enhanced and ordered due to the strong gas compression and/or local shear in these systems. This study supports an stationary condition for the large-scale magnetic field as long as the dynamical mass of galaxies is constant.",1

However, at large values of the initial current, i.e., very far from an initial equilibrium situation, a universal scaling of the defect production is obtained which shows an algebraic dependence with respect to the initial current value.

130739,0,Josephson current between topological and conventional superconductors We study the stationary Josephson current in a junction between a topological and an ordinary (topologically trivial) superconductor. Such an S-TS junction hosts a Majorana zero mode that significantly influences the current-phase relation. The presence of the Majorana state is intimately related with the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry in the system. We derive a general expression for the supercurrent for a class of short topological junctions in terms of the normal state scattering matrix. The result is strongly asymmetric with respect to the superconducting gaps in the ordinary ($\Delta_0$) and topological ($\Delta_{\mathrm{top}}$) leads. We apply the general result to a simple model of a nanowire setup with strong spin-orbit coupling in an external magnetic field and proximity-induced superconductivity. The system shows parametrically strong suppression of the critical current $I_c \propto \Delta_{\mathrm{top}}/R_N^2$ in the tunneling limit ($R_N$ is the normal state resistance). This is in strong contrast with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation applicable to junctions with preserved time-reversal symmetry. We also consider the case of a generic junction with a random scattering matrix and obtain a more conventional scaling law $I_c \propto \Delta_{\mathrm{top}}/R_N$.,1

We analyze the archive public data of the ALMA Cycle 0 where PKS 0521-365 is used as a calibrator. A total of 13 projects with 23 dataset is analyzed in band 3, 6 and 7 and combined. The whole set of data is combined and wavelet filtered to obtain a deep image reaching a dynamic range of 47000. The individual emission flux is measured at different date over a period of 11 months in various components. Finally we analyze the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) in each different component, including the radio jet and counter jet. The point sources detected in the field follow a similar distribution to previous studies. The blazar flux shows large variation especially in band 3. Different components are observed: core, radio jet and newly detected counter jet, Hot Spot (HS) and a disky structure roughly perpendicular to the jet. The HS emission is formed by a point source surrounded by an extended emission. The viewing angle of the jet is about 30 with a Doppler factor of 1.6$. The HS is at a distance of 19 kpc from the center. The SED analysis shows a strong variation of the core spectral index, especially in band 3. The two components in the radio jet have roughly a flat spectral index in band 6 and 7. Using these ALMA data the different weak and extended components are detected. The analysis of both jets constrains the geometrical distance of the HS to the center. The SED presents a different shape in time and frequency for each component. Finally a new structure is detected roughly perpendicular to the radio jet and a thermal emission origin is currently favoured. Further observations at higher spatial resolution are needed to confirm that hypothesis.",1

On Oct. 29th, 2015, the Earth crossed through a fold in the heliospheric current sheet. This is called a ""solar sector boundary crossing"". Under this circumstances, a large coronal mass ejection (CME) occurred at 2:24 UT, behind the west limb on the sun. Therefore, the boundary crossing occurred when in the blast's nearby environment was filled with energetic particles accelerated by the CME shock waves, spacecraft measurements (ACE and GOES) have shown that in such a case, protons with energies at least up to 30 MeV were stored within the range of the sector boundary. Thus, a fraction of the solar energetic particles (SEP) from CME, reached Earth around 03:00 UT in the aftermath of the solar blast, reaching the condition of an S1 (minor) radiation storm level. The effect at ground level was a small increase in the counting rate in some ground based detectors, such as the South Pole Neutron Monitor (NM) and a sharp peak observed in the counting rate in the New-Tupi detector in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Thule NM. The event is being classified as a new GLE (Ground Level Enhancement) in the current solar cycle, as the GLE 73. However, in all cases, the counting rate increase is smaller or near than 2\%. The Earth crossed through a fold in the heliospheric current sheet also caused a geomagnetic disturbance, below the minor geomagnetic storm threshold, observed in the ACE spacecraft and a small decrease in the counting rates of some ground level detectors, such as the New-Tupi detector and Thuly NM.

131196,0,"A Computationally Efficient Framework for Automatic Inertial Sensor Calibration The calibration of (low-cost) inertial sensors has become increasingly important over the past years since their use has grown exponentially in many applications going from unmanned aerial vehicle navigation to 3D-animation. However, this calibration procedure is often quite problematic since the signals issued from these sensors have a complex spectral structure and the methods available to estimate the parameters of these models are either unstable, computationally intensive and/or statistically inconsistent. This paper presents a new software platform for inertial sensor calibration based on the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments which provides a computationally efficient, flexible, user-friendly and statistically sound tool to estimate and select from a wide range of complex models. The software is developed within the open-source statistical software R and is based on C++ language allowing it to achieve high computational performance.",1
131242,0,"Remote Nanodiamond Magnetometry Optical fibres have transformed the way people interact with the world and now permeate many areas of science. Optical fibres are traditionally thought of as insensitive to magnetic fields, however many application areas from mining to biomedicine would benefit from fibre-based remote magnetometry devices. In this work, we realise such a device by embedding nanoscale magnetic sensors into tellurite glass fibres. Remote magnetometry is performed on magnetically active defect centres in nanodiamonds embedded into the glass matrix. Standard optical magnetometry techniques are applied to initialize and detect local magnetic field changes with a measured sensitivity of 26 micron Tesla/square root(Hz). Our approach utilizes straight-forward optical excitation, simple focusing elements, and low power components. We demonstrate remote magnetometry by direct reporting of the magnetic ground states of nitrogen-vacancy defect centres in the optical fibres. In addition, we present and describe theoretically an all-optical technique that is ideally suited to remote fibre-based sensing. The implications of our results broaden the applications of optical fibres, which now have the potential to underpin a new generation of medical magneto-endoscopes and remote mining sensors.",1
131271,0,"Analog Signal Processing Approach for Coarse and Fine Depth Estimation Imaging and Image sensors is a field that is continuously evolving. There are new products coming into the market every day. Some of these have very severe Size, Weight and Power constraints whereas other devices have to handle very high computational loads. Some require both these conditions to be met simultaneously. Current imaging architectures and digital image processing solutions will not be able to meet these ever increasing demands. There is a need to develop novel imaging architectures and image processing solutions to address these requirements. In this work we propose analog signal processing as a solution to this problem. The analog processor is not suggested as a replacement to a digital processor but it will be used as an augmentation device which works in parallel with the digital processor, making the system faster and more efficient. In order to show the merits of analog processing two stereo correspondence algorithms are implemented. We propose novel modifications to the algorithms and new imaging architectures which, significantly reduces the computation time.",1

Presence of Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, Informetrics, Webometrics and Altmetrics in the Google Scholar Citations, ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley &amp; Twitter Following in the footsteps of the model of scientific communication, which has recently gone through a metamorphosis (from the Gutenberg galaxy to the Web galaxy), a change in the model and methods of scientific evaluation is also taking place. A set of new scientific tools are now providing a variety of indicators which measure all actions and interactions among scientists in the digital space, making new aspects of scientific communication emerge. In this work we present a method for capturing the structure of an entire scientific community (the Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, Informetrics, Webometrics, and Altmetrics community) and the main agents that are part of it (scientists, documents, and sources) through the lens of Google Scholar Citations. Additionally, we compare these author portraits to the ones offered by other profile or social platforms currently used by academics (ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley, and Twitter), in order to test their degree of use, completeness, reliability, and the validity of the information they provide. A sample of 814 authors (researchers in Bibliometrics with a public profile created in Google Scholar Citations was subsequently searched in the other platforms, collecting the main indicators computed by each of them.

Our results are inconsistent with related studies which suggest that large scale R~several-15 kpc are ubiquitous in QSO2. We study the possible causes of discrepancy and propose that seeing smearing is the cause of the large inferred sizes. The implications in our understanding of the feedback phenomenon are important since the mass M (through the density), mass injection M(dot) and energy injection rates E(dot) of the outflows become highly uncertain. One conclusion seems unavoidable: M, M(dot), E(dot) are modest or low compared with previous estimations.

131816,0,"Non-Maxwellian electron distributions resulting from direct laser acceleration in near-critical plasmas The irradiation of few nm thick targets by a finite-contrast high-intensity short-pulse laser results in a strong pre-expansion of these targets at the arrival time of the main pulse. The targets decompress to near and lower than critical densities plasmas extending over few micrometers, i.e. multiple wavelengths. The interaction of the main pulse with such a highly localized but inhomogeneous target leads to the generation of a short channel and further self-focusing of the laser beam. Experiments at the GHOST laser system at UT Austin using such targets measured non-Maxwellian, peaked electron distribution with large bunch charge and high electron density in the laser propagation direction. These results are reproduced in 2D PIC simulations using the EPOCH code, identifying Direct Laser Acceleration (DLA) as the responsible mechanism. This is the first time that DLA has been observed to produce peaked spectra as opposed to broad, maxwellian spectra observed in earlier experiments. This high-density electrons have potential applications as injector beams for a further wakefield acceleration stage as well as for pump-probe applications.",1
131863,0,"Uncertainty Analysis for a Simple Thermal Expansion Experiment We describe a simple experiment for measuring the thermal expansion coefficient of a metal wire and discuss how the experiment can be used as a tool for exploring the interplay of measurement uncertainty and scientific models. In particular, we probe the regimes of applicability of three models of the wire: stiff and massless, elastic and massless, and elastic and massive. Using both analytical and empirical techniques, we present the conditions under which the wire's mass and elasticity can be neglected. By accounting for these effects, we measure nichrome's thermal expansion coefficient to be 17.1(1.3) ppm/K, which is consistent with the accepted value at the 8% level.",1

131931,0,"The DRAGON simulations: globular cluster evolution with a million stars Introducing the DRAGON simulation project, we present direct $N$-body simulations of four massive globular clusters (GCs) with $10^6$ stars and 5$\%$ primordial binaries at a high level of accuracy and realism. The GC evolution is computed with NBODY6++GPU and follows the dynamical and stellar evolution of individual stars and binaries, kicks of neutron stars and black holes, and the effect of a tidal field. We investigate the evolution of the luminous (stellar) and dark (faint stars and stellar remnants) GC components and create mock observations of the simulations (i.e. photometry, color-magnitude diagrams, surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles). By connecting internal processes to observable features we highlight the formation of a long-lived 'dark' nuclear subsystem made of black holes (BHs), which results in a two-component structure. The inner core is dominated by the BH subsystem and experiences a core collapse phase within the first Gyr. It can be detected in the stellar (luminous) line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. The outer extended core - commonly observed in the (luminous) surface brightness profiles - shows no collapse features and is continuously expanding. We demonstrate how a King (1966) model fit to observed clusters might help identify the presence of post core-collapse BH subsystems. For global observables like core and half-mass radii the direct simulations agree well with Monte-Carlo models. Variations in the initial mass function can result in significantly different GC properties (e.g. density distributions) driven by varying amounts of early mass loss and the number of forming BHs.",1

We report here the results from the studies of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and low temperature magneto-transport measurements in exfoliated ZrTe5 thin flakes.Several unique results were observed. First, an anomalous-Hall-effect-like behavior was observed around zero magnetic field (B).Second, a non-trivial Berry's phase of \pi\ was obtained from the Landau level fan diagram of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the longitudinal resistivity. Third, the longitudinal resistivity shows linear B field dependence in the quantum limit. Most surprisingly, quantum oscillations were observed at fractional Landau level indices N = 2/3 and 2/5, demonstrating strong electron-electron interactions effects in ZrTe5.",1

A sequence of broadband pulses with periods of approximately ten seconds were observed in X-rays at energies between 25 keV and 300 keV, and in microwaves at frequencies from a few GHz up to 34 GHz during an interval of one minute. The QPP X-ray source was located slightly above the limb where the south legs of large and small EUV loop systems were close to each other. Before the QPPs the soft X-ray emission and the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager signal from the energy channels below 25 keV were gradually arising for several minutes at the same location. It was found that each X-ray pulse showed the soft-hard-soft behavior. The 17 and 34 GHz microwave source were at footpoints of the small loop system and the source emitting in the 4.2 {7.4 GHz band in the large one. The QPPs were probably generated by modulation of acceleration processes in the energy release site. Analyzing radio spectra we determined the plasma parameters in the radio sources. The microwave pulses could be explained by relatively weak variations of the spectrum hardness of emitting electrons.",1

Topological and spectral features are related to the two independent phases of the scattering matrix: the total phase shift describing the frequency spectrum and the chiral phase sensitive to topological features. Conveniently designed gap modes with spectral properties directly related to the Chern numbers allow to scan these phases. An effective topological Fabry-Perot cavity is presented.",1

132231,0,"Development of Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors for the W-Band We are developing a Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detector (LEKID) array able to operate in the W-band (75-110 GHz) in order to perform ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and mm-wave astronomical observations. The W-band is close to optimal in terms of contamination of the CMB from Galactic synchrotron, free-free, and thermal interstellar dust. In this band, the atmosphere has very good transparency, allowing interesting ground-based observations with large (&gt;30 m) telescopes, achieving high angular resolution (&lt;0.4 arcmin). In this work we describe the startup measurements devoted to the optimization of a W-band camera/spectrometer prototype for large aperture telescopes like the 64 m SRT (Sardinia Radio Telescope). In the process of selecting the best superconducting film for the LEKID, we characterized a 40 nm thick Aluminum 2-pixel array. We measured the minimum frequency able to break CPs (i.e. $h\nu=2\Delta\left(T_{c}\right)=3.5k_{B}T_{c}$) obtaining $\nu=95.5$ GHz, that corresponds to a critical temperature of 1.31 K. This is not suitable to cover the entire W-band. For an 80 nm layer the minimum frequency decreases to 93.2 GHz, which corresponds to a critical temperature of 1.28 K; this value is still suboptimal for W-band operation. Further increase of the Al film thickness results in bad performance of the detector. We have thus considered a Titanium-Aluminum bi-layer (10 nm thick Ti + 25 nm thick Al, already tested in other laboratories), for which we measured a critical temperature of 820 mK and a cut-on frequency of 65 GHz: so this solution allows operation in the entire W-band.",1

Here, we study two different approaches to construct fiber Fabry-Perot resonators and stabilize their length for experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics with neutral atoms. A piezo-mechanically actuated cavity with feedback based on the Pound-Drever-Hall locking technique is compared to a novel rigid cavity design that makes use of the high passive stability of a monolithic cavity spacer and employs thermal self-locking and external temperature tuning. Furthermore, we present a general analysis of the mode matching problem in fiber Fabry-Perot cavities, which explains the asymmetry in their reflective line shapes and has important implications for the optimal alignment of the fiber resonators. Finally, we discuss the issue of fiber-generated background photons. We expect that our results contribute towards the integration of high-finesse fiber Fabry-Perot cavities into compact and robust quantum-enabled devices in the future.",1
132279,0,"Are we living in a quantum world? Bohr and quantum fundamentalism The spectacular successes of quantum physics have made it a commonplace to assert that we live in a quantum world. This idea seems to imply a kind of ""quantum fundamentalism"" according to which everything in the universe (if not the universe as a whole) is fundamentally of a quantum nature and ultimately describable in quantum-mechanical terms. Bohr's conception of quantum mechanics has traditionally been seen as opposed to such a view, not least because of his insistence on the necessity of the concepts of classical physics in the account of quantum phenomena. Recently, however, a consensus seems to be emerging among careful commentators on Bohr to the effect that he, after all, did subscribe to some version of quantum fundamentalism. Against this consensus, and by re-examining the historical record, I will defend a variant of the traditional reading of Bohr in which (1) the answer to what an object is (quantum or classical) depends on the experimental context; and (2) in principle, any physical system can be treated quantum-mechanically but not all systems can be treated that way at the same time.",1

We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the entanglement Chern number without the time reversal symmetry and spin conservation by extending the Kane-Mele model to include the Zeeman term. The numerical results confirm that the sum of the entanglement spin Chern number equals to the Chern number.",1
132365,0,"Chiral Exact Relations for Helicities in Hall Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence Besides total energy, three-dimensional incompressible Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) possesses two inviscid invariants which are the magnetic helicity and the generalized helicity. New exact relations are derived for homogeneous (non-isotropic) stationary Hall MHD turbulence (and also for its inertialess electron MHD limit) with non-zero helicities and in the asymptotic limit of large Reynolds numbers. The universal laws are written only in terms of mixed second-order structure functions, i.e. the scalar product of two different increments. It provides, therefore, a direct measurement of the dissipation rates for the corresponding invariant flux. This study shows that the generalized helicity cascade is strongly linked to the left polarized fluctuations while the magnetic helicity cascade is linked to the right polarized fluctuations.",1
132384,0,"Proximity-Aware Calculation of Cable Series Impedance for Systems of Solid and Hollow Conductors Wide-band cable models for the prediction of electromagnetic transients in power systems require the accurate calculation of the cable series impedance as function of frequency. A surface current approach was recently proposed for systems of round solid conductors, with inclusion of skin and proximity effects. In this paper we extend the approach to include tubular conductors, allowing to model realistic cables with tubular sheaths, armors and pipes. We also include the effect of a lossy ground. A noteworthy feature of the proposed technique is the accurate prediction of proximity effects, which can be of major importance in three-phase, pipe type, and closely-packed single-core cables. The new approach is highly efficient compared to finite elements. In the case of a cross-bonded cable system featuring three phase conductors and three screens, the proposed technique computes the required 120 frequency samples in only six seconds of CPU time.",1

132556,0,"The Ramachandran number: an order parameter for protein geometry Three-dimensional protein structures usually contain regions of local order, called secondary structure, such as $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets. Secondary structure is characterized by the local rotational state of the protein backbone, quantified by two dihedral angles called $\phi$ and $\psi$. Particular types of secondary structure can generally be described by a single (diffuse) location on a two-dimensional plot drawn in the space of the angles $\phi$ and $\psi$, called a Ramachandran plot. By contrast, a recently-discovered nanomaterial made from peptoids, structural isomers of peptides, displays a secondary-structure motif corresponding to two regions on the Ramachandran plot [Mannige et al., Nature 526, 415 (2015)]. In order to describe such `higher-order' secondary structure in a compact way we introduce here a means of describing regions on the Ramachandran plot in terms of a single Ramachandran number, ${\mathcal{R}}$, which is a structurally meaningful combination of $\phi$ and $\psi$. We show that the potential applications of ${\mathcal{R}}$ are numerous: it can be used to describe the geometric content of protein structures, and can be used to draw diagrams that reveal, at a glance, the frequency of occurrence of regular secondary structures and disordered regions in large protein datasets. We propose that ${\mathcal{R}}$ might be used as an order parameter for protein geometry for a wide range of applications.",1

For this purpose we first calculate all the eigenstates of the full Maxwell equations for the case where $\mu=1$ everywhere in the system. The eigenvalues appear as special, non-physical values of $\epsilon_1$ when $\epsilon_2$ is given. These eigenstates are then used to develop an exact expansion for the physical values of ${\bf E}({\bf r})$ in the system characterized by physical values of $\epsilon_1(\omega)$ and $\epsilon_2(\omega)$. Results are compared with those of a previous calculation of the local field of a time dependent point charge in the quasi-static regime.

We first prove that an unbounded, stable marginally outer trapped surface in an initial data set $(M,g,k)$ obeying the dominant energy condition is conformally diffeomorphic to either the plane $\mathbb{C}$ or to the cylinder $\mathbb{A}$ and in the latter case infinitesimal rigidity holds. As a corollary, when the DEC holds strictly this rules out the existence of trapped regions with cylindrical boundary. In the second part of the article, we restrict our attention to asymptotically flat data $(M,g,k)$ and show that, in that setting, the existence of an unbounded, stable marginally outer trapped surface essentially never occurs unless in a very specific case, since it would force an isometric embedding of $(M,g,k)$ into the Minkowski spacetime as a space-like slice.",1

Formulas to calculate the Wigner function of a product and of a superposition of wave functions are proposed. Properties of a Wigner function of interfering states are also investigated.

The same potential does not lead to a self-similar transmission when applied to the typical semiconductors described by the non-relativistic Schr\""odinger equation. The proposed system is one of the few examples in which a self-similar structure produces the same pattern in a physical property. The resulting scaling properties are investigated as a function of three parameters: the height of the main barrier, the total length of the system and the generation number of the potential. These scaling properties are first identified individually and then combined to find general analytic scaling expressions.",1
133543,0,"Computational issues in chemo-dynamical modelling of the formation and evolution of galaxies Chemo-dynamical N-body simulations are an essential tool for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies. As the number of observationally determined stellar abundances continues to climb, these simulations are able to provide new constraints on the early star formaton history and chemical evolution inside both the Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies. Here, we aim to reproduce the low $\alpha$-element scatter observed in metal-poor stars. We first demonstrate that as stellar particles inside simulations drop below a mass threshold, increases in the resolution produce an unacceptably large scatter as one particle is no longer a good approximation of an entire stellar population. This threshold occurs at around $10^3\,\rm{M_\odot}$, a mass limit easily reached in current (and future) simulations. By simulating the Sextans and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxies we show that this increase in scatter at high resolutions arises from stochastic supernovae explosions. In order to reduce this scatter down to the observed value, we show the necessity of introducing a metal mixing scheme into particle-based simulations. The impact of the method used to inject the metals into the surrounding gas is also discussed. We finally summarise the best approach for accurately reproducing the scatter in simulations of both Local Group dwarf galaxies and in the Milky Way.",1

This paper proposes an experiment to demonstrate the block universe using interplanetary distances and high relative speeds such as those accessible through the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The proposed experiment hinges on signals exchanged between Earth and the Orbiter which reveal a time interval of some tens of milliseconds in the future of the Earth which is already in the past of the Orbiter. Since this experiment can be performed at any time, and since the magnitude of the time interval can in principle be increased in proportion to the distances and speeds over which it is performed, an observer can always be found for whom the past is in the future of another observer. The only explanation that fits these observations is a block universe in which all events in the past, present and future of any observer are equally enfolded into spacetime.",1
133666,0,"Topological Insulators from Group Cohomology We classify insulators by generalized symmetries that combine space-time transformations with quasimomentum translations. Our group-cohomological classification generalizes the nonsymmorphic space groups, which extend point groups by real-space translations, i.e., nonsymmorphic symmetries unavoidably translate the spatial origin by a fraction of the lattice period. Here, we further extend nonsymmorphic groups by reciprocal translations, thus placing real and quasimomentum space on equal footing. We propose that group cohomology provides a symmetry-based classification of quasimomentum manifolds, which in turn determines the band topology. In this sense, cohomology underlies band topology. Our claim is exemplified by the first theory of time-reversal-invariant insulators with nonsymmorphic spatial symmetries. These insulators may be described as 'piecewise topological', in the sense that subtopologies describe the different high-symmetry submanifolds of the Brillouin zone, and the various subtopologies must be pieced together to form a globally consistent topology. The subtopologies that we discovered include: a glide-symmetric analog of the quantum spin Hall effect, an hourglass-flow topology (exemplified by our recently-proposed KHgSb material class), and quantized non-Abelian polarizations. Our cohomological classification results in an atypical bulk-boundary correspondence for our topological insulators.",1

We have also done some calculations in order to derive the time evolution operator for the considered problem.,1
134117,0,"The formation of massive, quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon The cosmic noon (z~1.5-3) marked a period of vigorous star formation for most galaxies. However, about a third of the more massive galaxies at those times were quiescent in the sense that their observed stellar populations are inconsistent with rapid star formation. The reduced star formation activity is often attributed to gaseous outflows driven by feedback from supermassive black holes, but the impact of black hole feedback on galaxies in the young Universe is not yet definitively established. We analyze the origin of quiescent galaxies with the help of ultra-high resolution, cosmological simulations that include feedback from stars but do not model the uncertain consequences of black hole feedback. We show that dark matter halos with specific accretion rates below ~0.25-0.4 per Gyr preferentially host galaxies with reduced star formation rates and red broad-band colors. The fraction of such halos in large dark matter only simulations matches the observed fraction of massive quiescent galaxies (~10^10-10^11 Msun). This strongly suggests that halo accretion rate is the key parameter determining which massive galaxies at z~1.5-3 become quiescent. Empirical models that connect galaxy and halo evolution, such as halo occupation distribution or abundance matching models, assume a tight link between galaxy properties and the masses of their parent halos. These models will benefit from adding the specific accretion rate of halos as a second model parameter.",1
134247,0,"A Diamagnetic Trap with 1D Camelback Potential The ability to trap matter is of great importance in experimental physics since it allows isolation and measurement of intrinsic properties of the trapped matter. We present a study of a three dimensional (3D) trap for a diamagnetic rod in a pair of diametric cylindrical magnets. This system yields a fascinating 1D camelback potential along the longitudinal axis which is one of the elementary model potentials of interest in physics. This potential can be tailored by controlling the magnet length/radius aspect ratio. We developed theoretical models and verify them with experiments using graphite rods. We show that, in general, a camelback field or potential profile exists in between a pair of parallel linear dipole distribution. By exploiting this potential, we demonstrate a unique and simple technique to determine the magnetic susceptibility of the rod. This system could be further utilized as a platform for custom-designed 1D potential, a highly sensitive force-distance transducer or a trap for semiconductor nanowires.",1
134288,0,"Multiplicative expression for the coefficient in fermionic 3-3 relation Recently, a family of fermionic relations were discovered corresponding to Pachner move 3-3 and parameterized by complex-valued 2-cocycles, where the weight of a pentachoron (4-simplex) is a Grassmann-Gaussian exponent. Here, the proportionality coefficient between Berezin integrals in the l.h.s. and r.h.s. of such relations is written in a form multiplicative over simplices.",1
134491,0,"Metrics for Optimization of Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Observations of Stellar Variables and Transients The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be the largest time-domain photometric survey ever. In order to maximize the LSST science yield for a broad array of transient stellar phenomena, it is necessary to optimize the survey cadence, coverage, and depth via quantitative metrics that are specifically designed to characterize the time-domain behavior of various types of stellar transients. In this paper we present three such metrics built on the LSST Metric Analysis Framework (MAF) model (Jones et al. 2014). Two of the metrics quantify the ability of LSST to detect non-periodic and/or non-recurring transient events, and the ability of LSST to reliably measure periodic signals of various timescales. The third metric provides a way to quantify the range of stellar parameters in the stellar populations that LSST will probe. We provide example uses of these metrics and discuss some implications based on these metrics for optimization of the LSST survey for observations of stellar variables and transients.",1
134821,0,Classical R-matrix theory of dispersionless systems: I. (1+1)-dimension theory A systematic way of construction of (1+1)-dimensional dispersionless integrable Hamiltonian systems is presented. The method is based on the classical R-matrix on Poisson algebras of formal Laurent series. Results are illustrated with the known and new (1+1)-dimensional dispersionless systems.,1
134858,0,"Energy deposition from focused terawatt laser pulses in air undergoing multifilamentation Laser filamentation is responsible for the deposition of a significant part of the laser pulse energy in the propagation medium. We found that using terawatt laser pulses and relatively tight focusing conditions in air, resulting in a bundle of co-propagating multifilaments, more than 60 % of the pulses energy is transferred to the medium, eventually degrading into heat. This results in a strong hydrodynamic reaction of air with the generation of shock waves and associated underdense channels for each short-scale filament. In the focal zone, where filaments are close to each other, these discrete channels eventually merge to form a single cylindrical low-density tube over a $\sim 1 \mu\mathrm{s}$ timescale. We measured the maximum lineic deposited energy to be more than 1 J/m.",1
135199,0,"Leibniz algebras associated with representations of the Diamond Lie algebra In this paper we describe some Leibniz algebras whose corresponding Lie algebra is four-dimensional Diamond Lie algebra $\mathfrak{D}$ and the ideal generated by the squares of elements (further denoted by $I$) is a right $\mathfrak{D}$-module. Using description \cite{Cas} of representations of algebra $\mathfrak{D}$ in $\mathfrak{sl}(3,{\mathbb{C}})$ and $\mathfrak{sp}(4,{\mathbb{F}})$ where ${\mathbb{F}}={\mathbb{R}}$ or ${\mathbb{C}}$ we obtain the classification of above mentioned Leibniz algebras. Moreover, Fock representation of Heisenberg Lie algebra was extended to the case of the algebra $\mathfrak{D}.$ Classification of Leibniz algebras with corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{D}$ and with the ideal $I$ as a Fock right $\mathfrak{D}$-module is presented. The linear integrable deformations in terms of the second cohomology groups of obtained finite-dimensional Leibniz algebras are described. Two computer programs in Mathematica 10 which help to calculate for a given Leibniz algebra the general form of elements of spaces $BL^2$ and $ZL^2$ are constructed, as well.",1
135211,0,"Hausdorff separability of the boundaries for spacetimes and sequential spaces There are several ideal boundaries and completions in General Relativity sharing the topological property of being sequential, i.e., determined by the convergence of its sequences and, so, by some limit operator $L$. As emphasized in a classical article by Geroch, Liang and Wald, some of them have the property, commonly regarded as a drawback, that there are points of the spacetime $M$ non $T_1$-separated from points of the boundary $\partial M$. Here we show that this problem can be solved from a general topological viewpoint. In particular, there is a canonical minimum refinement of the topology in the completion $\overline{M}$ which $T_2$-separates the spacetime $M$ and its boundary $\partial M$ ---no matter the type of completion one chooses. Moreover, we analyze the case of sequential spaces and show how the refined $T_2$-separating topology can be constructed from a modification $L^*$ of the original limit operator $L$. Finally, we particularize this procedure to the case of the causal boundary and show how the separability of $M$ and $\partial M$ can be introduced as an abstract axiom in its definition.",1
135262,0,"Extended Eckart Theorem and New Variation Method for Excited States of Atoms We extend the Eckart theorem, from the ground state to excited statew, which introduces an energy augmentation to the variation criterion for excited states. It is shown that the energy of a very good excited state trial function can be slightly lower than the exact eigenvalue. Further, the energy calculated by the trial excited state wave function, which is the closest to the exact eigenstate through Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization to a ground state approximant, is lower than the exact eigenvalue as well. In order to avoid the variation restrictions inherent in the upper bound variation theory based on Hylleraas, Undheim, and McDonald [HUM] and Eckart Theorem, we have proposed a new variation functional Omega-n and proved that it has a local minimum at the eigenstates, which allows approaching the eigenstate unlimitedly by variation of the trial wave function. As an example, we calculated the energy and the radial expectation values of Triplet-S(even) Helium atom by the new variation functional, and by HUM and Eckart theorem, respectively, for comparison. Our preliminary numerical results reveal that the energy of the calculated excited states 3rd Triplet-S(even) and 4th Triplet-S(even) may be slightly lower than the exact eigenvalue (inaccessible by HUM theory) according to the General Eckart Theorem proved here, while the approximate wave function is better than HUM.",1
135292,0,"Quantum criticality with two length scales The theory of deconfined quantum critical points describes phase transitions at temperature T = 0 outside the standard paradigm, predicting continuous transformations between certain ordered states where conventional theory requires discontinuities. Numerous computer simulations have offered no proof of such transitions, however, instead finding deviations from expected scaling relations that were neither predicted by the DQC theory nor conform to standard scenarios. Here we show that this enigma can be resolved by introducing a critical scaling form with two divergent length scales. Simulations of a quantum magnet with antiferromagnetic and dimerized ground states confirm the form, proving a continuous transition with deconfined excitations and also explaining anomalous scaling at T &gt; 0. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for quantum criticality, with potentially far-reaching implications for many strongly-correlated materials.",1
